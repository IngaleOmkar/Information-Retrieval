    "## Word Sense Disambiguation from GPT: ( useless )\n",
    "\n",
    "Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is the process of identifying which sense of a word is used in a sentence, when the word has multiple meanings. This is a more complex task in NLP and often requires understanding the context in which a word is used. One common approach to WSD is to use supervised learning models trained on annotated corpora, but for simpler applications or demonstrations, we can use pre-built libraries like NLTK that come with some capabilities for WSD.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, let's use NLTK's Lesk algorithm, which is a simple and classical algorithm for WSD. The Lesk algorithm works by comparing the words in the context of the target word with the words in the definitions of the target word's various senses, and selecting the sense with the highest overlap of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how you can implement a basic WSD using NLTK's Lesk algorithm for a given sentence and target word within that sentence:"
