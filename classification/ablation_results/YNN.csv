56,AMKOR AMKR Is an absolute bargain today s price an AI boom future Let s face AI boom isn t going away any time soon I say guy who had decided entirely he missed NVDA train then proceeded YOLO 700 call right before close yesterday then panic sell 2500 win but 2300 less than I could sold if I held mere 20 minutes longer I m officially convinced AI next mega growth space AI requires chips NVDA somewhere neighborhood 90 these GPU s something doesn t appear will challenged immediate future While many other major tech players decided they going enter space isn t process happens particularly quickly I think reasonable expect NVDA s dominance space should continue least next couple years The US desperate need independence semiconductor space AMKOR company will help take us there The pandemic was an absolute screaming example why we need more control over chip supply chain chip shortages caused supply chain debacles brought many electronic industries halt auto industry well The resulting inflation created by issue among any other issues was pronounced enough Biden initiated what I believe most important prominent success his administration thus far CHIPS Science act pledging give something like 39 billion grants incentives US based across supply chain bolster domestic production capabilities Once chip manufactured or least ones required AI tasks they required packaged via process called CoWoS or Chip Wafer Substrate This process fairly complex there aren t many companies worldwide able package way currently Contrary popular believe Chips Shortgage we faced recent years isn t actually shortage chips but rather inability package chips using CoWoS quick enough keep up absolutely insane demand TSMC Taiwain Semiconductor Manufacturing Company far away largest current packager CoWoS chips they actually manufacture NVDA chips well but s an entirely different wall text all together NVDA actually built moat sorts around GPU chip industry However there several major problems NVDA s reliance TSMC chip packaging TSMC cannot currently keep up demand Not even close This was reiterated by their chairman recently September he stated will several years before they can keep up NVDA CoWoS needs Even if TSMC could keep up NVDA s needs they can t there tons other major players entering space need CoWoS packaging which will further create demand more packaging facilities TSMC currently manufacture all almost all their chips Taiwan While they agreed new plants Germany Japan China United States Taiwan s national security considerations US interest well mean they will likely continue manufacture their most advanced chips Taiwan They ve actually had get approval US government manufacture package their less advanced chips their two facilities China TSMC will always imminent threat action China decides take This likely big catalyst Chips Act supply chain shortages were The US doesn t want reliant what China decides do or not do regards Taiwan when comes our chips All these items leave massive opportunity new players enter space I believe AMKOR will major player fills role future There many reasons why I m bullish AMKR specifically but I ve outlined few major reasons below AMKR only US based company currently ability package CoWoS chips The Biden administration repeatedly stated again again how important US ability package chips domestically AMKR 55 years old They stood test time They aren t some brand new start up entirely dependent debt or issuing massive amounts new shares fund their growth AMKR actually pays dividend making attractive boomers well It s dividends also purely been covered by free cash flow amounting just 18 free cash flow last year They also increased dividend by 25 each year average AMKR liabilities been decreasing every year percent their assets AMKR strong balance sheet free cash continuing grow every year AMKR started development massive manufacturing packaging facility Peoria Arizona building 2bb plant there will 500k sq ft clean room space AMKR expanded their already existing partnership Apple Chip packaging November Apple already pledged first largest customer said plant Through partnership Apple already worked extensively strategic vision manufacturing capabilities said facility Peoria AMKR applied grant Chips act develop said facility I believe they will get said grant As I mentioned previously they currently only US company CoWoS capability This important Biden administration b James Joo Jin Kim whose family founded AMKR who largest shareholders currently lot ties Penn Biden lot ties Penn While I haven t found any direct relationship between two I would like believe if Biden an leverage where these grants dispersed AMKR likable sense AMKR s current cap only 7bb Plenty room baby run especially given segment And finally best last AMKR surged June upon rumors NVDA was directly helping AMKR packaging solutions CoWoS AI Chips Amkor 2 5D chip packaging nearly doubled 3 000 wafers monthly early 2023 5 000 by year end projections 7 000 by end 2024 80 these NVDA That s all I today I ve burned 1 5 hours my work day typing out I am normally an invest 401k day trade lotto plays type guys For foreseeable future I intend acquiring more more shares AMKR continuing buy Options far out future I can currently stacking 09 20 35 Calls My hope AMKR will get

certainly been warm winter This labor refuses give despite Fed throwing almost 500 bps 5 points rate hikes gearing up more CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART But unemployment rate rose Yes unemployment rate rose 3 6 up 3 4 January However was entirely positive reasons The unemployment rate Bureau Labor Statistics BLS measures number people unemployed who looking work divided by size labor force Last month number unemployed people looking work rose by about 240 000 However s because 419 000 people entered labor force e started looking work That s sign healthy labor People will start looking work only if they think they can get job The labor force measure issues related how participation measured they count someone being labor force only if someone looking work But lot people may not do so any number reasons including not feeling confident job or non economic reasons like not having access childcare The measure also can fall over time because lot retiring baby boomers One way get around these issues look employment population ratio prime age workers e workers aged 25 54 years This measures number people working percent civilian population think opposite unemployment rate because we use prime age get around demographic issue well The good news prime age employment population ratio just hit 80 5 which close highest level we ve seen couple decades CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART It helps recall we just had multi generational black swan event form pandemic But once everything re opened expectation was things would bounce back immediately And lot numbers did including GDP employment consumption However there were also lot people who left labor force amid pandemic And what we re seeing now each month there s continuous flow people back into labor force these people finding jobs quickly Just over past six months 1 5 million more people come into labor force prospects finding job improve Make no mistake really strong labor my opinion Is labor too strong It s weird even ask question but matters Federal Reserve In their model economy they see tight labor one results stronger wage growth And strong wage growth can drive demand higher pushing up prices inflation Well hopefully they can rest little easy front Average hourly rose just 0 2 February Over past three months wages been growing an annualized pace 3 6 well below 6 pace we saw last year It s getting very close pre pandemic pace 3 1 CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART This backs up other evidence wage growth indeed easing including Employment Cost Index which gold standard wage growth measures The ECI was running an annualized pace 4 2 Q4 2022 down 4 8 Q3 The January February hourly data suggest wage growth continues decelerate The big question whether Fed buys Powell s comments week front Congress did not inspire confidence It looks like string hot economic data left them questioning their decision ease pace rate increases 50 bps 25 bps February wondering if they should move back up 50 bps their March meeting At point markets think outcome coin toss which not great Powell simply injected maximum uncertainty into markets But looking beyond Fed s March meeting big picture labor appears remain really strong This means economy also remains strong s not bad thing far markets concerned Though also means Fed likely keep interest rates higher longer Panic At Fed Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell s comments week during his semi annual testimony front Congress did not inspire much confidence respect path monetary policy It seems like Fed officials confused what they want do next Case point last month Powell said disinflationary process started Since then we ve had run strong economic data including January payrolls retail sales inflation And looks like was enough spook Fed The shift was clear Powell s statements week Inflationary pressures running higher than expected time our previous Federal Open Market Committee FOMC meeting And The ultimate level interest rates likely higher than

today ES Spy just sat chopped very tight range up until power hour ES had only moved total 16 5 points SPY only moved total 1 37 This makes easily one smallest overall ranges ES Spy moved inside intraday very long time I think only time had smaller range was when markets had half days x200B Fun chart above shows there been 10 other times being 11th where SPX had 12 green weeks out 13 row The max total drawdown 3 months after was 2 36 On average 3 months after move like markets were 3 84 higher AMD x200B As writing AMD down about 1 well off low initial reaction GOOGLE x200B Google down nice 3 35 writing MSFT x200B MSFT initially had nice green reaction but now down about 1 after hours CALENDAR x200B We some heavy hitting data next three days some very important pre data tomorrow FOMC x200B Of last 9 FOMCs we opened green 5 out 9 times an average move up 0 16 overnight We also closed green 5 out 9 times an average close 0 73 However I don t know last time we had three major data night into FOMC This FOMC an interesting one my opinion why I honestly do not think FOMC matters grand scheme things Why Its simple markets 100 expect continuation pause rates meeting There nothing really surprise markets rates We also do not get DOT Plot arguably most important thing comes FOMC until March Meaning while JPOW can say whatever he wants about rate cuts forward guidance until markets see change dot plot march meeting really doesn t matter We did spike CPI last meeting which I do expect JPOW emphasize concerning them However really does not matter because we get two more readings CPI before March meeting Almost every event last 4 months markets said event finally sends us down Yet just continued rally every single time chooses not care about pretty much anything I still find completely unwise bet against bulls grand scheme things This feels lot like I believe was October 2023 where we had similar move CPI FOMC Earnings all around same week two week time frame IT set up perfect bearish scenario yet markets chose completely ignore all rally I do think same setup presents however I would wait actually turn bearish before I short If markets bloody think 1 least close tomorrow there sizeable chance we see downside continuation However until we realistically get move like more importantly stated before close under daily 20ema I think markets will continue ignore all data continue pump upside As friendly warning anyone not traded FOMC Day 2pm will big move will violent Tread lightly 230pm historically when we see reversal SPY DAILY x200B We
