C3.ai's aggressive advertising strategy, allocating a substantial 35% of their revenues compared to Palantir's more conservative 5%, raises concerns about its sustainability and the genuine value of its offerings. The company's approach of imitating successful trends, similar to behaviors observed during the dotcom bubble, suggests a lack of genuine innovation and a potential for financial instability. This, coupled with criticisms of developing ""half-assed"" products to merely gather customers for acquisition rather than creating lasting value, positions C3.ai unfavorably in the eyes of skeptics who question its long-term viability and contribution to the AI industry. Adding to this, earnings are coming next week, and I'm buying puts but would love to hear anyone who has an alternative thesis.

Today I will write some quick and easy understandable DD on why I am buying the dip on $CAR Avis Budget. 

https://preview.redd.it/60hmchm8mqkc1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eeb5289023f23ba5dcc4ef4d66cd21b33a7f9e94

The past several months retail and many traders have jumped into a not profitable company that sells cars CVNA . CVNA has a 14 billion market cap and has 202 million shares outstanding.

CAR has a market cap of 3.73 billion and has just 36 million shares, check their 10Q. For the year 2023 CAR used cash generated from business to buy 4.3 million shares for a total of 889 million! Yes! They bought nearly 25% of the entire current market cap in cash!

The 4th quarter alone they bought back 1.4 million shares for a total of 257 million.

CAR had record revenues of over 12 billion for 2023. They are coming off of the 2nd most profitable year, ever! \[2022 was the most\]. They had EBITDA of 2.5 billion on that 12 billion and had EPS of 42.61! They beat the last quarter EPS by 3.22‚Ä¶ In fact if you count the 4 quarters in 2023 they beat by 12.60! Is that a reason to be bullish?

If those earnings don‚Äôt get you bullish about CAR ‚Ä¶ The buyback doesn‚Äôt get you bullish‚Ä¶

The 4th quarter saw CAR give a special dividend of 10 dollars! The stock is at 105! 

Another reason to be bullish? About 18 million shares are available‚Ä¶. Half the shares are being held‚Ä¶ When this flew 3 years ago from 100 to 400 it was because it is very easy to move a stock when they are no shares available‚Ä¶ Well as I wrote above, the company actually has 5+ million less shares than 3 years ago.

17,NIO - DD - Is there potential here?,7,1aznrch,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1aznrch/nio_dd_is_there_potential_here/,29,"First, let me say that anything to do with Chinese companies, I typically don't touch. But I have to say, there could be potential here (and a surprise in earnings day which is coming up next week Tuesday - March 5th).

* First, NIO has been shifting -similar to Tesla- from high end vehicles, to more affordable options in order to broaden its audience. And this has paid off. In a very recent post on their investors relations section, NIO claims an increase in deliveries of 13.9% in December 2023 compared to December 2022. As well as an increase of 25% year-over-year in deliveries in the three months ending with December...  
[https://ir.nio.com/news-releases/news-release-details/nio-inc-provides-december-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2023](https://ir.nio.com/news-releases/news-release-details/nio-inc-provides-december-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2023)
* In their Q3 earnings call, they announced receiving approval from uncle Xi to operate ""independently"" (whatever the hell that means)... The company estimated at the time that this would result in a 10% decrease in operational expenditure. (I got this from the transcript of Q3 earnings call)
* Labor cost cutting - in November, the company announced it will be trimming its workforce by 10%. It said it would complete these cuts in November. Moreover, they announced even further trimming in labor cuts. And a cancellation of projects that won't contribute to revenues in the next 3 years. (Again, this all happened in November).  
[https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/chinese-ev-upstart-nio-plans-eliminate-10-its-positions-2023-11-03/](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/chinese-ev-upstart-nio-plans-eliminate-10-its-positions-2023-11-03/)

* Anyone who is even slightly familiar with NIO's business, knows about their battery swapping stations. I personally love this model... Swappable batteries are a much more realistic model than fast charging IMO. But I digest... NIO used to offer battery swaps for free WTF!!! Up until June of 2023. Some analyst said that NIO used to sell Carbon Credits to offset the cost of free battery swaps... But either ways, now that battery swaps are no longer free, we can expect a further increase in revenue.  
[https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/chinas-nio-cuts-prices-all-models-ends-free-battery-swapping-services-2023-06-12/](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/chinas-nio-cuts-prices-all-models-ends-free-battery-swapping-services-2023-06-12/)
* While it's true that both TSLA and Lucid didn't beat expectations in Q4 23 earnings, BYD did. NIO target audience is much more comparable to BYD's even though they constantly cite TSLA as their biggest competitor... It's more logical to compare to XPeng, BYD, Li Auto, etc... These are the main players in the Chinese market. BYD reported earnings, beating estimates. Li Auto is coming up tomorrow. Worthwhile keeping an eye on...
* Lastly, I'd like to say that NIO faces an uphill battle in the upcoming few years on various fronts... First, the chinese government is no longer offering incentives to EV manufacturers. It seems that the chinese market has become saturated.  
To add to that, the outlook for the upcoming few quarters isn't that great from a macro economic perspective. The AI bubble is leading the US stock market while other sectors are lagging behind severely. Not to talk about the chinese economy which is facing its own challenges (and possibly increasing pressure if Trump takes office... Tariffs? Taxes? Who knows...).

Producer Consumption Expenditures (PCE) is the the biggy!  Let‚Äôs start with GDP - market expects 3.2% (yoy). My guess it will exceed expectations based on wage growth and the boom in the market for the pass 4 months.  A good think!   

PCE is expected at 0.4% vs 0.2% prior.  If we meet - the market will boom this Thursday.  The FED‚Äôs favorite indicator should lay out the expected rate cuts for the remainder of the year.  The print will be a strong indicator if our economy continues to be healthy.  If we come in high - the FED will most likely hold short rates longer.  Worst case they could signal increases rather than holding for longer.  

Typically March is a tough month when it comes to bubble bursts. Examples - lows hit with the dot.com in 2001, and the Great Recession - in March 09 we hit a low.

I think it‚Äôll be different this year.  

1) Money is starting to pour into the market as short term T-Bill expire.  FOMO is just starting.  

2) Money is rolling in from overseas.  Euro companies are starting to list on the NYSE.  They are running from the Europoor regulators.  

3) Berkshire‚Äôs operating profits up 30% over last year‚Äôs 4th quarter even with their cash holdings at record levels.  Warren Buffet although cautious needs to deploy all that cash flooding in. Warren buy something other than Treasuries and Japanese stocks!

4) High tariffs on China is inflationary. China is ready to flood the market with low price goods, but Uncle Sam is taking a cut rather than passing the savings on to us smucks.  China is desperate even with tariffs -goods will start flowing regardless.  

If PCE comes in high-buy the dip.  My guess it‚Äôll be hot ü•µ.   But have no fear - buy big on the dips.  Cash is trash.  Boom üí•!  My opinion only.  Your thoughts!   ",2024-02-25,0

I want money so I can be rich in 10 years and live comfortably. Then leave it to my kids so they will be OK.

So I care about money today and also what it is worth in 10 years, 20 years so forth.

That, right there, is the problem with investing in AI.  It can make me rich today and tomorrow.  But in 10 years or less it could render money worthless.  If tech keeps improving exponentially like this, the only things that will have value in the future will be raw materials and robots.  Not investments, portfolios, gains or money itself.

You could make 20mil on NVIDIA today but wind up no better off.  When money is worthless you can't be rich.  And 20mil is not enough to have your own robot army to hold your own against the tech billionaires and trillionaires.

Think it through long term guys, to you seriously want to invest in the end of money?  Lets get rich off something else so we can atleast enjoy it.

Edit: Some people dont seem to understand what robots are.  When you control vast numbers of robots, that do everything for free, you don't need anyone, for anything.  If you want raw materials you can just take them.  It's feudalism.  So money will be worthless.  There is no value chain in the AI future.  The feudal rulers will take what they want by force using robot warriors.  Simple as that.

Edit 2:  Some people are suggesting that investing in the potential creation of Skynet is a better long-term strategy than divesting from AI??  That will also lead to the extinction of money!!!  And possibly humans but who cares about that.  

I just really love money.  I dunno, I thought you guys would be with me on this...

Edit 3:  Looks like I am not crazy after all, its a massive bubble and it's coming at us faster than ever because the timelines for new tech just get shorter and shorter.  People are starting to see AI it for what it is really is.  The ultimate enemy of money and bringer of crashes. Phew.

Some of you may remember BYND from a few years ago where it once traded as high as $240. The stock is currently under $8. BYND hit an all-time low of $5.58 in Oct 2023.

Before your ADHD kicks in, I want to mention a few key metrics that might keep you interested, then I will continue with my thoughts:

Short Interest: 38.24% of float (as of 1/31/24)

Borrow Rate on IB: 362.95%

Borrow Rate on Fidelity: 151.50%

Float Count: 61m

Outstanding: 64m

Market Cap: $504m

As you can see, the shorts are paying a hefty price to maintain their short position.

Ok, back to my thesis. BYND once had a market cap of over $15b, right in line with the lower end of other publicly traded consumer packaged food companies (PEP, MDLZ, KHC, CPB, K, CAG, GIS, HRL all have market caps ranging from $13b-250b). Beyond's market cap is currently $504 million. After the initial hype of eating a burger that tastes like a burger but isn't a burger wore off, sales have been on the decline. They are still burning cash. Shorts smelled the cash burn and declining sales and got involved, big time. Currently, nearly 40% of their float is short. If you open your brokerage account, you will likely be unable to short this stock because there's no shares available to short. It hasn't been available on my platform for several months (Fidelity), and I've been watching the HTB (Hard-To-Borrow) rate slowly tick up to the current rate of 151.50%. This is the highest HTB rate I have seen for BYND yet on Fidelity. The rate on Interactive Brokers is 362%. This is very high.

Ok, so sales suck, they're burning cash, why on earth would I be bullish? Glad you asked. In my opinion, there are 3 types of people who would potentially eat plant-based meat:

1. People who find it unethical to eat animals
2. People who care about helping the environment
3. People who want a healthier alternative to meat

People who fit into the first 2 groups are the ones eating Beyond products right now, and will probably continue to do so. Group 3 hasn't really been eating BYND products, as BYND is often critized for their ingredient stack. Until now, the nutrition profile of Beyond Burgers have been in line with classic 80/20 beef burgers. Saturated fat, calories, protein, etc - pretty similar, but not necessarily healthier. While Beyond burgers have zero cholesterol, they're made with canola oil and have more sodium that real burgers, so that's the tradeoff. But that's about to change. On 2/21/24, BYND announced they're releasing the next generation of Beyond Meat - ""Beyond 4"" - this new iteration is being made with avocado oil, which is known for its heart-healthy monounsaurated fat, faba beans, red lentil beans, and fewer ingredients overall. Because of this, saturated fat is going to be cut by 60% and sodium by 20%. Many ""health"" people (you know who they are) argue that most/all of these fake meat brands use seed oils that are high in Omega 6s, which are inflammatory. This product bucks that trend using exclusively avocado oil, giving nutrition critics very little to complain about. Most notably, this new recipe has been certified by the American Heart Association's Heart-Check program - and will include that invaluable AHA logo on the packaging. This news was announced 2 days ago, and the stock has steadily climbed about 10% since then.

On the surface, a new recipe doesn't seem like much. But I believe this is incredibly important and substantial news. Now, finally, people who fall into Group 3 above (people who want a healthier alternative to meat) will have it. And while I can't prove it, I believe the size of the Group 3 market is by far the largest of the 3 groups I mentioned above. This is going to be a game changer. Specific pricing hasn't been announced, but they did state it will sell for a premium over traditional Beyond meat, which currently retails at the same price as beef.

Additionally, per Yahoo Finance this past November after the previous ER, ""\[CEO\] Brown said customer demand in Europe was a bright spot during the quarter. Beyond Meat's international retail sales rose 39% while international food service sales jumped 79%, largely due to European demand for its plant-based burgers and nuggets at McDonald‚Äôs. McDonald‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt sell those products in the U.S.""

CEO Ethan Brown also stated (I believe during the last CC), ""In the EU, the consumer is driven not only by taste ... but also climate plays a significant role in the consumer decision around the food system and food choices, as well as health.""

Per a Vegconomist article from January 2024, ""The trend is very pronounced in the UK, where 48% of the population is cutting down on meat, and a fifth claims to purchase plant-based meat at least once a week.""

Also per a Vegconomist article from November, ""A recent research by Circana shows a 48% increase in out-of-home plant-based meat sales in Germany, France, the UK, Italy, and Spain since 2019. Among the products, plant-based burgers have seen an exceptional rise, with a 20% year-on-year increase and an overall 90% growth since 2019.""

Still with me? Ok, good.

Earnings are coming next week. Tuesday, Feb 27 after market close. With 40% short interest, expectations are extremely low. If BYND surprises with better than expected growth in Europe, I think we can go higher. On the other hand, if earnings are terrible, it's possible we could go lower - but probably not much lower, since we're already at a $500m mkt cap and shorting isn't really an option right now. Plus, I think investors will be forgiving, what with the new recipe launching soon. Either way, I think it's worth sticking around at least until the new Beyond 4 product hits shelves, which is expected this spring. I think that can generate a lot of buzz, particularly if they taste as good or better than the current iteration. I would imagine they will. After the hype, I would be interested to see how it reflects in the following ER. With summer approaching, people tend to eat healthier, so a launching a lower-fat version of a burger in the spring could be exact perfect timing. I don't expect this to immediately bounce back to a $15b market cap, but I think $3-4b cap is very much in the cards, which would bring this $8 stock to $30-40.

Finally, I'll mention one last thing about their cash burn. For the past year or so, they had been burning about $50m/quarter. However, their most recent quarter we have data on (9/30/23), they had $217m, which is actually UP from the $210m they had the previous quarter. If that trend continues, I believe that will be yet another positive signal to wall street.

There's probably a lot of points I left out, and I hope we can discuss those further. Thank you all for indulging me and I look forward to hearing your thoughts on $BYND.

Full Disclosure, I love their burgers and I am long 4800 shares.

So, this is one of them: over a decade ago, Cambridge Analytica was accused of paying a researcher to collect data from Facebook, including user names, genders, locations, etc. from around 30M people.

And Facebook had no specific policies to assess the results of their investigation into this case, which was discovered in 2015 but not disclosed until March 2018. They also told to the reporters who were investigating this that they had no evidence from their side.

In 2018 they finally disclosed it and were suited by SEC over this incident and the stock drop. Good news is that they recently decided to pay $100M over this, so if you were investor back then and were damaged you [can check it](https://11thestate.com/cases/facebook-sec-fair-fund) (and also I found out that there were fairly small number of filing so you can get bigger payment due to this).

Anyway, I think even if they are paying something now, its their endless saga of data privacy and at some point people would be fed up with it. But tho Meta is one of the M7 for now and I think they would be even more up with the AI and so on implementation.",2024-02-24,0
44,Twilio is a tale of two Directions.  Like the great AI philosophical question: Is Twilio a tool or a destination?,8,1az1f2k,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1az1f2k/twilio_is_a_tale_of_two_directions_like_the_great/,8,"I am interested in opinions on Twilio‚Äôs stock from the WSB community.  Given the last earnings report in which earnings and revenue beats came in handily, it is interesting that there was such a large decline in the stock price in large part (I think) due to the looming decision on what to do with the Segment business and the uncertainty of whether Twilio can leverage AI for its offerings in a meaningful way.

There were a number of meaningful data points to unpack, but I found it interesting that they moved $54M in revenue previously attributed to the Segment Line of business (previously Data and Applications) to the Communications side.  This seems to imply sale of the unit positioning, while retaining assets that may be accretive to the overall communications core business that can be leveraged more effectively in the future.
  Other semi positive data points that I consider meaningful:
- Segment is ‚Äústrategically important.‚Äù  Mentioned several times by the CEO.  Seems contradictory to a decision to reallocate a portion of the Segment Revenue.  What‚Äôs the point if the unit will continue as part of Twilio?
- the impact of crypto volume on the business.  This seems to have good long term tailwinds for Twilio although a short term drag.  Not sure the long term impact is considered fully. 
- cash and cash equivalents of $4B.  $1B in debt.  Implies 30% of the market value of the business roughly based on current valuation.
- improving earnings picture and revenue and non-GAAP earnings better than consensus consitently.
- share buyback in progress and cash incentive plan to reduce share price dilution moving forward.  Stock based compensation declining as a percentage of revenue from prior quarters.
- continues to be a visionary leader and has a leadership position in its space.
- significant high value customer wins.  Although not much detail provided there was allusions to the impact of the AI features tipping the scale.
- improving gross margins (except in Segment)
- a target for acquisition - usually this is good for stock price‚Ä¶.but perhaps the valuation / price is unclear for them‚Ä¶.
Negative data points include:
- management stock incentive plans still meaningfully dilutive for the short to medium term.
- macro interest rate environment reducing valuation of growth tech
- revenue growth <10% annually which is not a high growth tech trajectory
- more competition in space
- fragmented offerings that promise use of AI to customers yet may not be sufficiently differentiable.
- macro headwind on small cap tech with money all flowing into largest tech titans.  I see this as analogous to shift in consumer markets from small business to big business (mom and pop shifting to big box)‚Ä¶.this is now happening in the market which is unusual in my mind and it is not all clear (to me at least) what the implications are with that‚Ä¶..

So, what are your thoughts for Twilio based on the above and your own DD?  
What are your other thoughts based on the above?  Is Twilio a tool that will be supplanted by something better or will it become a destination again for investors?

Thanks for your opinions.

50,Simple QQQ options swing,74,1az06ag,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1az06ag/simple_qqq_options_swing/,41,"Just gonna put this here for anyone who wants to take a look at it, there are probably a lot of things you could do to optimize this strategy but it works as is, and every time I've tried to optimize it I've only made it worse.

Simple rules to the strategy, we'll be buying calls dated no less than 31 days out, generally the longer the date the better, strike price would vary depending on your desired risk. I like anywhere from 10 to 20 dollars out of the money. 

There are 4 sets of entry criteria, calls only no puts here, I tested through every major market crash since 2000 and puts are just a gamble in my opinion. I will list the entries in the order of their success rate based on my tests.

1st entry criteria, any single red day with a loss greater than 1 ATR compared to the previous days closing price. Entry at end of day. 

2nd criteria is 3 significant red days in a row. 3 red bars where price stays relatively flat is not an entry, we want to see 3 days where price closes lower by noticeable amount. This is fairly subjective. Entry at EOD.

3rd entry, uptrend pullbacks that touch the 20 EMA, entry at 20 EMA whatever time that may be. 

4th entry and likely the weakest entry is simple trend following, after a large move up were looking for a pullback to the 20 EMA and then the entry will be on the break of the previous high, EOD entry. 

Very simple entry rules, as with most trading strategies the hard part comes with the trade management. Taking profit is the hard part, but I've broken my thought process down into a few separate steps for deciding on what to do next.

I like to look at the trade 7 days, 14 days and 21 days after entry. I don't have a ""rule"" for exits. We're using options, so it's a question of extending risk. Two major things working against us are time and volatility. 

If, before the 7 day point I have a large movement in my direction I might sell half or 3 quarters of my contracts and take the money, if I'm red I wait another week. At 14 days I'm looking to sell most of my remaining contracts if I'm green, if I'm red I wait some more. At 21 days I'll flatten my position regardless of what's on the chart. It's really a question of ""am I in profit enough that I'd be upset if I lost it"" if the answer is yes, I lock it in. The entry rules here ensure you are almost always in the market so FOMO is a bit easier to control in my opinion. 

I've backtesting this going back 10 years and I specifically tested the dot.com bubble, the 08 crash and the covid crash. It can work.",2024-02-24,0

Banking in general are going to confront the sins of the past in 2024 on two fronts :

First consumer debt continues to get wildly out of hand with signs of rising delinquency on unsecured debt (credit cards) and easy to walk away from assets (cars). The VA have publicly said that they are worried about Veteran's ability to stay out of foreclosure because of rising costs, including insurance and household debt, which means the damage would quickly move from credit cards and cars to mortgages. I don't think we're looking at a 2008 meltdown in housing, but it won't be pretty.

Secondly, commercial real-estate: While Citi Bank analysts are trying to convinced us that there is little risk of contagion or large scale issues, the Financial Times recently wrote that commercial real estate exposure to delinquent loans now far outstrips the large bank's set-aside reserves, and the situation is even more bleak with banks like OZK and Valley who massive exposure and little liquidity for reserves. Delinquency for the large banks (including CITI lol) tripled in the last year, and more than doubled for all banks.   


Right now, I simply do not see these risks as priced in, and will continue to grow my short positions on the financial sector, buying 1-2 year put options whenever the prices on KRE and XLF trend up, while staying long on both SPY and Tech stocks since I expect the next 2 years to be extremely ugly for banks, but with limited impact to the broader market given the evidence we saw in 2008 of how quickly the Fed stepped in to provide capital (print money) to protect the rest of the economy.

There is... a lot of debt expiring in 2025, what's scary about this is that if they cannot pay down a chunk of it or interest rates don't get cut that 3.2% is going to jump massively. Some REITs have been able to get a decent rate (low 4%) thanks to getting CMHC insured loans. I have no idea if $TNT-UN is eligible but regardless 26% of their debt is about to get A LOT more expensive. 

\-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Value Metrics:

* **NAV to price:**
   * $28.56 to $8.58
   * Current sitting @ 69.95% under NAV
* **P/AFFO**
   * Assuming Q4 AFFO (times 4): $2.56 / $8.58
   * P/AFFO: 3.35
* **Dividend Yield:**

Assuming they bring the dividend back and only pay 50% AFFO  (Management said they would bring the dividend back in June but didn't give a %).  
Historically $TNT has paid 60% to 90% of their AFFO as dividends. Lets take a super conservative approach and assume a 50% payout ratio

* $**2.56 / 2: $1.28 annual dividends  (or $0.1066 monthly)**
* gives a yield of:   
14.92% (with a 50% payout ratio)

\-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I currently own 37 shares @ $8.58 (I know its a small position) but my goal is to keep adding as much as possible till May/June till they bring back the dividend. The reason being is that the price dropped drastically on news of each   
2 dividend cut: $46.94 - $25.84 and $33 - $20,   
and when they suspended the dividend it dropped again: $11 - $6.42 I'll be it slowly

&#x200B;

The history of this REIT is really bad I won't sugar coat it.   
But the valuation is borderline being priced as bankruptcy. I don't see that happening with the tenants, management and the AFFO they would have available if they DID choose a dividend payout ratio 50%. Even with higher interest they can at least afford it even with higher interest rates.

So what's everyone's opinion? Am I stupid for wanting to buy it this as long as it remains below $9.00?",2024-02-23,0

March $1.50c are cheap and are suitable to my risk tolerance.

Reposting b/c auto-mod thought I was spamming a different ticker

1: The backstory. Polestar (PSNY) is a small-ish Swedish EV company that went public via SPAC in 2021. Since then, it‚Äôs been continuously faded as a giant POS stock (like RIVN, etc). It‚Äôs been funded by two major automotive groups ‚Äì Volvo (Sweden) and Geely (China). It‚Äôs been a perpetual downward slope since IPO, and it‚Äôs been written off.

Their market cap is about $3 billion, with about 10% short interest, 1.1 bn share float, and 470mm shares outstanding.

As a manufacturer, [they delivered 54,600](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1884082/000119312524006609/d676194dex991.htm) cars in 2023 ‚Äì a 6% growth YoY, and about the same as Rivian.

But wait, didn‚Äôt Rivian just get gapped down like a Thanksgiving turkey? Yeah, but even still they‚Äôve got a market cap of $11 bn. So, that‚Äôs like at least a 200% rise that PSNY can enjoy to get on par. (The alternative is that RIVN loses another 60% of its market cap‚Ä¶).

Polestar makes good cars, and they are def a luxury brand, [winning awards in 2022](https://investors.polestar.com/news-releases/news-release-details/polestar-wins-car-design-and-auto-trader-awards-back-record). Their build-quality is cited as being top-notch, when compared with Tesla and others.

2: Catalysts ‚Äì The Good, the Bad, the Unknown.

The Bad: Today,[ Volvo announced they will no longer be financing Polestar, but will maintain and 18% stake, and the logistical relationship](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a46611722/volvo-polestar-stop-funding-news/). This drove the stock price down 8% today, and I think the last few days of sell-off has been linked to insider anticipation of that news. Polestar knew this was coming,

The Good: Polestar knew this was coming, which is why they put out the [press release on 1 February](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1884082/000119312524021381/d729931dex991.htm), welcoming Geely Sweden Holding into the fold as a potential investor. Geely is the Chinese EV company, and if there‚Äôs one thing Chinese companies love, it‚Äôs ownership of other more legit-looking companies with high standards of quality.

The Unknown: Polestar reports before the market open next Thursday. They‚Äôre a foreign company, so their financial results are *un-audited!* That‚Äôs right, they can say whatever they want, because they won‚Äôt have to back anything up until months later. ‚Ä¶.And if there‚Äôs another thing that Chinese companies love, it‚Äôs creatively bending accounting practices and earnings reports. I don‚Äôt necessarily suspect foul play, but there‚Äôs definitely a chance that they try to pump themselves up a little bit. Alternatively, as their brand catches on and gains recognition, they can rise on their own merit.

3: The Play: This is my position, so you can inverse me. March $1.50 Calls. They‚Äôre stupid-cheap, as all of PSNY‚Äôs calls are. If Earnings are good (I think it will be), or there‚Äôs funding secured, or there‚Äôs positive partnerships, then this stock can go up 100%. As of the close today, the March $1.5c were trading at $0.12. So, if PSNY gets to $3 between now and then, that‚Äôs over 1200% profit on the $1.5c.

As always, not financial advice, do your own diligence.

https://preview.redd.it/bfjvl84ltekc1.jpg?width=1524&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8542d73d62f1d08656983f0e59b5ddf3a80cdd6

Total capital invested: 316,050

Total margin used: 622,650

Total investment: 938,700

My maintenance margin allows this stock to fall to $25 before I get a margin call. I do have some measures I will take to add cash to my account if it comes to it, likely forestalling a forced sell to $\~21.¬† I predict the odds we go below $21 over the next 12 months to be around 10%.

This risk goes down over time as I add cash to my account each month (as I plan to add regular savings of about $1,500 each month) as well as fully reinvesting the dividends. In other words, after the first year, the stock will need to fall to \~$20 to be in a forced sale situation, and it only goes down from there.

Based on some conservative calculations over the next 6 years: dividend growth of 3% annually (I expect 4-5%, they have had 6% compound annual dividend growth over the last 25 years), with the share price increasing 2-7% annually, I will end up with 48,000-52,000 units, receive $115,000-$130,000 in annual distributions, inflation protected due to increasing dividends thereafter, and be paying about $30,000-$45,000 in margin interest (dependent on fed funds rate).

At this point I will be 45 years old and will be able to fully retire on this income.

In the worst case scenario: I get margin called into a forced sale at \~$21/share this year (current share price is $27.68). I lose approximately half of my liquid assets (retirement account plus personal brokerage account value). I will be unable to retire at 45, but otherwise be in a reasonably good financial position for my age (I own my own home, locked in at a 2.675% mortgage, and will still have sufficient savings to be on track for a normal retirement around 65 years old).

Why I love this stock and why I made this bet:

Current dividend yield of 7.44%

25 year history of increasing the dividend every single year, at a compound rate of over 6%. They increased it during the dot com bust, the great financial crisis, the pandemic, and all manner of energy price swings.

Solid, conservative management with large insider ownership (over 30% of the company owned by insiders)

Low volatility in the stock price (the price range over the last 52 weeks is **24.66 - 27.95** )

Energy demand will only continue to increase over time as the energy requirements for the chips powering AI will grow exponentially as more are produced and utilized.

Very advantageous tax structure: structured as a master limited partnership. The income gets reported to me on a K-1 and is always substantially lower than the amount of dividends paid out, meaning the effective tax rate is very low on the income.

I will provide updates on this bet quarterly after each dividend reinvestment.

I have attached a picture of a spreadsheet with my baseline prediction.  Note that the share price growth is irrelevant to the prediction so long as I don't fall below my maintenance margin.  A slower share price growth is actually beneficial as I will be able to buy more units when I reinvest dividends, so long as dividend growth remains at 3% or better.

TLDR: $TPR is a proven breakout with a path to long term profits and growth that you should go full regard into.

Analysis:
-The company reported stellar FY23 performance beating expectations and guidance is bright with EPS raised over analysis consensus
-Mid-market luxury consumer brands aren‚Äôt hurt by inflation; in fact, Coach brand revenues grew over 6% worldwide in 2023
-TPR is smoking analysts‚Äô price targets of $45-$50 (targets have been underestimated historically)
-It pays a fat dividend
-I‚Äôve owned the stock a really long time, like four years or something. Found it around pandemic time 
-It‚Äôs only made me money since I first bought it

Conclusion: You should buy stocks and options issued by $TPR NOW.

Suggested Trading Strategy: Go long in the issuer and pile into LEAPs. Then, BUY MORE next quarter,  and the quarter after that. The last quarter of the year, before they crush FY ER and the stock moons another 50%, but more shares and bull calls. Then, take profits, and do it all over again in 2025.

It seems the stock moved similarly 2 Fridays in a row, but I‚Äôm jumping onto this meme stonk pretty late so idk.

There are talks of stock dilution because the company is trying to raise 1.5 billion by selling convertible senior notes based on $975 price per share, which will raise money for them but apparently also dilute existing shares, I don‚Äôt understand how this works cause I‚Äôm regarded but it sounds like using inflation of the shares to raise money from actual big dog investors.

So what‚Äôs the play? Puts or calls? It seems like both are the answer but the question is timing. Probably SMCI will keep rocketing up but will dip in the long run, try not to get burned, but we all know 99% of regards need to burn so that 1% that time it right will be rewarded.

I was thinking about buying calls before market close today but decided not to because of theta over the weekend. Maybe the best play is to buy calls if it tanks at market open on Monday 02/26 or puts if it pumps at market open.",2024-02-23,0
107,Bond Bear market - Who will lend US money?,3,1aybgvm,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1aybgvm/bond_bear_market_who_will_lend_us_money/,6,"[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-31/gold-demand-to-hit-record-with-central-bank-buying-wgc-says](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-31/gold-demand-to-hit-record-with-central-bank-buying-wgc-says)

Central banks all around the world are buying and hoarding precious metals, now I know what you will say that foreign holders still own a large part of the US debt.

[https://ticdata.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Documents/slt\_table5.html](https://ticdata.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Documents/slt_table5.html)

But those purchases are misleading b/c these are foreign cash reserves, they want to put it in a place where they can liquidate at any moment and expect not to loose ""value"" when selling. The pro being these foreign nations own the debt denominated in a World reserve currency and the con being the currency itself is being devalued. These all leads us to a bigger question. I believe the next recession is here, Japan and UK and parts of Europe have already fallen in recession. So whenever the US falls in recession and the FED lowers the rates - The very point I believe there is going to be massive selling of Long dated Treasuries from all foreign nations.

And maybe starts QE back up to avoid the commercial real estate tsunami from wiping out regional banks. Who is going to buy our debt? this question becomes even more FUN b/c over 10+ Trillion of debt is due this year not counting the real Federal deficit this year.

[https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/10-trillion-in-u-s-government-bonds-for-sale-in-2024/](https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/10-trillion-in-u-s-government-bonds-for-sale-in-2024/)

So if you are a central bank of another country why the fuck would you want to buy long dated US treasuries again. No other institutions are going to help buy either. So either the Fed monetizes the debt, which FUCKS the Currency or interest rates on the long bond can go above 10% maybe higher. Don't see a out for the Fed in either scenario.

C3.ai, long hailed as a chameleon in the tech landscape, has been surfing the waves of the AI hype, along with several other trends, and now appears primed for a significant correction. Let's delve into its journey: Founded in 2009 by Thomas Siebel, the company initially bore the name ""C3,"" a nod to its mission aimed at tackling carbon footprints through the ""measure, mitigate, and monetize"" approach. The evolution of its name from C3 Energy to C3IoT in 2016, and finally to C3.ai, reflects its shifting focus and adaptability. Despite going public in 2020 amidst much fanfare, C3.ai has since encountered market skepticism and notable criticism, especially following Siebel's substantial share liquidation post-IPO. 

It appears customer numbers are decreasing, from what I can gather. Additionally, considering that Palantir Technologies ($PLTR) has a growing customer base and actual profit margins, it seems to be a more reliable investment option.

So my fund has a large position in META and so, to confess, I am talking my book here.  However, facts are that Zuck will, by the end of 2024, have purchases over 350,000 Nvidia H100 AI computers and will proprietary build another 300,000 H100 equivalent compute nodes.  He has stated that here: [https://www.facebook.com/4/videos/290456847348165/](https://www.facebook.com/4/videos/290456847348165/)  Why all the AI compute?  Rumor has it (and from a very reliable source also), that META's goal here is to become the AWS (Amazon Web Services) of AI compute for all large and small companies. META currently offers their LLaMA open source language model to the developer community for AI model development.  Why open source versus closed proprietary models like ChatGTP?   Perhaps so that the ultimate developed AI workload can run on the META hyperscale worldwide redundant server network - thus explaining the massive H100 infrastructure build currently being deployed.  Proprietary language models like ChatGTP must be rented as a service and cannot be used for custom AI development instances.  Most large entities and governments will want custom AI compute, and in many cases multiple instances of AI compute for different tasks (defense, crime fighting, tax collections, etc).

Remember AWS is worth, by many estimates, more than Amazon's retail e-commerce division.    What will META be worth when they are the primary provider of AI hosted infrastructure to start-ups, consumers, small and large businesses and world governments?  Probably well over $3000 per share - and this increase in share price will occur rapidly within the next 3 years should it become evident META is becoming the AWS of AI.   META remains, despite its recent massive run up, the cheapest of the mega-cap tech stocks (and in an election year advertising environment also....).

So this is still a largely secret program at META (why let potential competitors like AWS know their strategy ahead of time).  But, once announced, expect further gains in META's equity valuation - perhaps very substantial gains.

158,"$ARQT Earnings | The Company You've Never Heard of, Because Why Would You Have?",11,1ay27g7,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ay27g7/arqt_earnings_the_company_youve_never_heard_of/,17,"**ARQT has run up 347.76% ($2.01 to $9.01) over the past 3 months** and is down 60.95% from its IPO in 2020 at $21.80. Earnings are premarket 02/27 and it is going to **MOVE** someway, but I'm leaning towards a major short term correction *(all numbers are at time of writing).*

# The Company You've Never Heard of, Because Why Would You Have?

**How I Took Note:** Dermatologist mentions a new treatment for Sebderm would be approved this year with an emphasis on 1. the first new treatment in over 20 years 2. the only non-steroidal option worldwide and 3. only all-body use option. The active ingredient had already been approved as a cream for the treatment of Atopic Dermatitis, but she was seeing firsthand that it worked for SebDerm. That said, unless you had both, you weren't getting the cream through insurance so back to the FDA decision on the foam.

**ARQT Summary:** Biotech firm. They focus on skin diseases. Their portfolio is okay, what matters is that ZORYVE foam for the treatment of Seborrheic Dermatitis just got approved end of December and became nationally available in the USA last month.

**My History Playing the Stock:** These people are desperate for a new treatment, so I bought in that same day and got burned buying too early. I exited and re-entered months later at the $2.00 price point. I bet big on what appeared to be an obvious approval by the FDA of ZORYVE foam for the treatment of Sebderm before the FDA's decision date (listed December 16th) and won out (sorry, it was under 500m market cap at the time)*.* **I've increased my position and bought additional calls since then . . . until now.**

**THE PROS** *(I Remain Long)***:** Its a monopoly on a medicated daily applied skin care product that people will need to continue purchasing and applying **FOR LIFE** for a market targeting 11% Americans. While their are periods of remission, there is **NO CURE** for SebDerm, nor is it something you can ignore as it is quite painful and aesthetically unpleasant.

**THE CONS** *(Why I Bought Puts):* Two ER's back was lackluster and lead to the stock falling 5%-20% daily from about $7, until steadying out below $2 before the the PFUDA date. They also needed to restructure debt agreements and were replacing the marketing team and other officer positions (both resolved since then). The real kicker was sales of ZORVYN cream for Atopic Dermatitis were not being picked up as quickly as guidance had predicted. Now, after this 350% run up, **I see the same reality about to hit their earnings call again**, this time based on the guidance for the real money maker (ZORVYN foam). **The issue is expectation vs reality and the reality is despite being available nationwide, people can not get it outside of a $1500 price tag and this should be conveyed in the guidance.** I have a prescription from my dermatologist sitting right now at the pharmacy, but health insurance providers have not picked up coverage. That said, don't be caught holding puts when insurance jumps onboard.

**TLDR:**

*The stock ran up because the company has an incredible future after the FDA approval. The drug has no competition for roughly 11% of Americans: it targets an incurable aesthetically harmful disease, you use it for life, it requires daily topical application, it is the only non steroidal option,* ***so I'm holding shares.***

***I'm buying puts*** *because the new approval squeezed the stock, but in the past shareholders reacted poorly to ZORVYN creams slow uptake and people can't get the new ZORVYN foam at all. My own regarded anecdote being that my pharmacy told me my prescription for ZORVYN foam isn't covered and I have to pay $1500 for a bottle because it's ""too new.""*

***I'm also holding $12.5 calls*** *because I'm regarded and emotionally invested, so I want the company to do well and I don't want to miss a rocket.*

&#x200B;

**TLDR;DR:** *I own $10,000 in shares cause long, $10.0 $7.5 $5.0 strike puts because the stock ran 350% after FDA approval and nationwide availability at pharmacies,* ***but guidance will show insurance is dragging their feet on picking up coverage***. . . and $12.5 calls because I am regarded.

*This is not financial advice.*",2024-02-23,0

163,Thoughts on Uber,3,1ay1izq,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ay1izq/thoughts_on_uber/,22,"Uber grew its full year top line revenue YOY by 16.95% (good not great for a company supposedly still in the early stages of its life cycle). In 2023, after interest expense (and not including its paper appreciation of marketable security investments it held), it earned $477M for the year. Like I noted, the company realized an appreciation of $1.8B from it‚Äôs marketable securities which left it ultimately, after tax, with net income earnings of $1.8B for the year, and a current PE ratio of around 90. However, if you net out the $1.8B due to this paper appreciation of it‚Äôs marketable securities, which is NOT part of it‚Äôs core operating business, you are left with a net income of sub-$400M post taxes for full year 2023. That would more than quadruple the current PE ratio to a PE over 360. While investors are happily seeing the company FINALLY stop losing a billion dollars a quarter, if top line revenue is only growing at 10-15% in the years ahead, it really doesn‚Äôt seem to deserve an adjusted PE ratio of 360. I think a bullish case for UBER is that it stays in this SP window for at least a couple years, and the bearish case is that this is a discretionary service with terrible margins, and any decrease or slowing in demand could turn this into a falling knife. 

Uber has also seriously benefitted from inflation. It has been able to charge far more per drive or delivery, while paying its drivers only a small increment of this increase. I‚Äôm not sure this is sustainable because blue collar wages are finally increasing (a very good thing IMO), while inflation for services is moderating (Uber is a service). For a company with already very tough margins, that could be an issue. When I lived in SF I once had a very interesting chat with one of my Uber drivers. She was a 55 yr old black woman with children she was still working to support - my ride was at 10pm so she was definitely working late. She told me that she made most of her money by simply adding her name to a lawsuit mailing list. Whenever there was a lawsuit for theft of wages, which is apparently often, she would add her name and often receive a $1K - $5K payout. She told me how she was making $20 - $30k per year from this ($40K on a good year). Ultimately she said that after gas, insurance, etc. most of her savings were from these lawsuits, and because Uber doesn‚Äôt want the attention from these, quite a few of the lawsuits were simply settled (obviously the defendants were represented either on contingency or pro-bono). All she had to do was prove she was a consistent driver for Uber, which she obviously was, and she could be added to these lawsuits along with hundreds of other drivers. I was fascinated by her story, and it also made me realize what a flawed business model this really was. It also made me wonder what would happen if more drivers learned about how easy they could make settlement money. Tbh I‚Äôve never driven for Uber so I can‚Äôt verify her story completely, but she had zero reason to impress me with this, and I found it very surprising. 

Ultimately I think Uber is an interesting company but unfortunately with an adjusted PE ratio of over 360, top line revenue growth of 10-15%, and potentially a growing headache with drivers since it has a flawed business model (no driver benefits), I‚Äôm fairly bearish. I understand Wall Street wanted to pump this thing into its inclusion with the S&P, but if you‚Äôre thinking this is the next Nvidia you‚Äôre very wrong. ",2024-02-23,0

But Wall Street doesn‚Äôt GAF about company morals. The fact this company is up over 500% in the last year and even 30-40% overnight is very telling to me. Even the articles don‚Äôt want to mention that the company missed revenue and EPS because it had one ‚Äúgood‚Äù quarter to offset all the shitty quarters before.

Looking ahead, they can‚Äôt use that quarter to claim profitability. Do you realize they could have missed EPS by almost 70 PERCENT and still could push the headline that they were profitable in the last fiscal year?

To me this seems like a super easy short or an opportunity to buy puts that would expire no earlier than late May, with a focus that their next earnings will be shit again and probably before then Wall Street will dump their pump and say bye Felicia.

OpenAI and Google's recent advancements in AI are compelling (Sora and gemini 1.5). And for the foreseeable future they will have to pay NVDA to keep the AI revved up and not just for development but for usage (60% 40% of their revenue is inference), which they will have no problem doing considering how much profit they expect to gain from AI services.

Google invested billions in their TPU, billions into DeepMind and google Brain, billions into Waymo, Bard and Gemini and they are still heavily truck-loading NVDA GPUs! Why? Because NVDA platform is a better solution. This industry is not about hardware only, software is a huge component. NVDA has a reputation of proven solutions and such status commands a premium in the enterprise market.

Also NVDA secured priority access to TSMC‚Äôs manufacturing resources due to TSMC flow of production capacity. So until TSMC expands its supply to exceed NVDA demand, you have nothing to worry about.

And one more thing. If we truly achieve AGI then there's no limit for NVDA. They have always kept up on R&D to protect thier moat and they deal in much more than just hardware.

She then notified BP and she was put on leave and then fired even though she had no knowledge he was going to do it.

The company buys the land that hospitals sit on to provide immediate liquidity, then charges rent on the property based on the price of the land. 

[Our main character](https://preview.redd.it/jitw437ny8kc1.png?width=1338&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d508e9a61a21574a0c915cbbb88b04fb2612ce9)

The company often does business with private equity firms, such as Steward Health Care Systems, a company that has bought scores of hospitals across the country in the past decade. One example of these hospitals is Good Samaritan Hospital in Brockton, Massachusetts, which was purchased in 2010. In 2016, the land the hospital sat on was sold to MPT as part of a package of all nine of Steward's hospitals in Massachusetts, costing MPT north of a billion dollars. 

&#x200B;

[Lol. Lmao even.](https://preview.redd.it/15e27na819kc1.png?width=1286&format=png&auto=webp&s=83e86ede7c479c493c088192c8cd91257c5fdd70)

This price is the kicker. The land the hospitals were located on was worth far less than a billion dollars, but MPT charges hospitals based on the acquisition price of the land. The hospitals, which are owned by Steward, are saddled with a huge increase in operating costs, often in excess of 5 million dollars per year. Meanwhile, Steward has the equity to continue the scheme while MPT rakes cash from the overinflated rent figures. 

&#x200B;

[Business was booming!](https://preview.redd.it/8w6vxzoe29kc1.png?width=1682&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2f6fd643ac92363a15d901326fe83236bc96036)

Steward (and other private equity firms) and MPT were able to keep up the scheme through the 2010s, seeing a stock that outpaced major indices in a long bull run. MPT was able to collect rent from struggling hospitals that managed to stay afloat in the prosperous 2010s.  

&#x200B;

[COVID, of course](https://preview.redd.it/l05doqy459kc1.png?width=660&format=png&auto=webp&s=63671e48fb4d0d8eac3b00d643c56ee54fa84002)

However, the scheme started to unravel shortly before the COVID pandemic. Steward began missing payments to vendors, such as travel nurse staffing agency Aya Healthcare. In order to keep the scheme going, Steward sued these vendors before they tried to collect payments and repo items. In addition, Steward also obscured their financial condition from Massachusetts state regulators while trying to secure loans to stave off their looming liquidity crisis. COVID, which greatly increased low-margin emergency work and effectively cut off less essential high-margin work, finally began to topple the hospitals. 

&#x200B;

[And it all falls down](https://preview.redd.it/4nyeqoi769kc1.png?width=1344&format=png&auto=webp&s=da064e84d5b946764129d7bc78848c4ef6f689a0)

Steward couldn't keep putting off payments and avoiding repos forever, and by late 2023, hospitals were operating underequipped, and Steward was missing rent payments to MPT.  Now, in February 2024, Steward has accumulated 50 million dollars of debt just to MPT and millions more to other institutions, including the state. 

&#x200B;

[Circling back to MPT](https://preview.redd.it/8rfnc6ww69kc1.png?width=2608&format=png&auto=webp&s=96f4895395e23faebaa4eef7673784dfc6c5d11e)

You know what they say. When you owe the bank 50 dollars, it's your problem; when you owe the bank 50 million dollars, it's the bank's problem. Both the federal and state governments have ruled out bailouts for Steward, which seems headed straight for insolvency. If/When Steward becomes insolvent, MPT will suffer as collateral damage. This model of private equity firms buying hospitals and selling them for jacked up prices to MPT so they can charge exorbitant rent is a thinly veiled Ponzi scheme that enriches the C suite and both companies while the hospitals and their communities suffer. It appears inevitable that the same will happen in other hospitals, such as the 430+ other properties owned by MPT. The government has set a precedent that it will not bail out either company in the event of insolvency, leaving MPT holding the bag on their overvalued properties. 

&#x200B;

tldr: MPT will be bagholding overvalued properties when financially overtaxed hospitals become insolvent

Wayfair is up 10.70% for the day on a very up-beat earnings call.

Management cites they are in phase 3 of return to profitability, 2023 losses will be a ceiling going forward.

Staff reductions of 13% will result in 280M in savings in 2024 that will hit their bottom line and increase EBITDA by 50% YOY.

Strong market share puts them in a position to generate positive earnings growth in an improving macro-economic environment.

$2B in cash and cash equivalents give them a 3.5 year runway at current losses to return to profitability (likely to happen much sooner).

28% short positions on Wayfair (Citadel holds largest short position of 4M shares = $200M) make this stock a likely candidate to take off in the next few weeks.

Seems like Long time mods and users got Pre-Invites. Now they are going to do a pre-reg DSP. DSP being you get to buy shares at the Base IPO price not the pre IPO price just before Trading. 

So like if it's IPO is $10 and you put in $100 you may get 10 you may get 5. It will usually be through a separate bank app run by one of them or ""CS"" that you can transfer later. Similar to what T-Mobile did a while back.

As per my last post, I started buying puts at open as SMCI reached $850 before open. I YOLOed into about 18 of those 700p hoping for any dip that might have brought the stock down, of course the dip never came.

While I was waiting for the dip I decided that I would make some $$ buying some close to itm calls for small gains which well didn‚Äôt work so well either as u can see from the 880 and 900c.

After much internal debate I took the loss on the 700p when SMCI reached about $910 and I watched it go to $940 not believing what I am seeing. A $200 rally, I thought no way this is real at which point I asked my wife who has zero actual investing experience and was actually sound asleep on what I should do and she said it will keep going up, to $1000 and that I have paper hands (calls would have printed if I held).

I lost it and bought a 950c when the stock was at $940 and doubled down with a 970c when the stock reached $965. Managed to get out at $980/985. But still a loss overall.

TL:DR Fuck any analysis, thesis, this thing just prints money if you hold and buy calls. Unless ofc theres another dump.

* User Metrics and Advertising: Reddit has over 100,000 communities and saw an average of 73 million daily and 267 million weekly active users in Q4 2023.

* Market and Future Plans: The company targets a global advertising market, excluding China and Russia, estimated at $1.4 trillion by 2027. Reddit aims to enhance its search capabilities and leverage AI to improve ad sales and introduce new revenue streams, including a data-licensing business with an initial value of $203 million over two to three years.

253,3 Letters WBD. Look at the Harry Potter Wand Pattern on this Chart. Then Read My Analysis. It is Pure Magicüßôü™Ñ üìà,8,1axgi8l,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1axgi8l,33,"
So I have been waiting for WBD price to get back down to the 9.65 range because I knew if it ever did, it would set up a life changing trade. Here is the reason why. 

The WBD chart looks eerily similar to what the BTC chart looked like Jan 2023. 

The first chart pic is WBD currently (2.21.24). The second chart is BTC from its high, until it bottomed in Nov 2022. The last chart is BTC current day from the Nov 2022 low. BTC price has more than trippled. WBD will be at more than 3x simply by retracing to the .382 fib (roughly $35).

BTC had at least one retracement of .382 during its decline, WBD has NOT. If you know your TA and you see this chart, you would be salivating. The WSB community isn‚Äôt dumb!
 
Ladies and gentlemen:

I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR PRICE TO GET HERE FOR A YEAR 

PRICE HAS TO REVISIT THE HIGH.

PRICE WILL REVISIT THE HIGH.

The question isn‚Äôt when, the question is how fast.

As much consolidation as I am seeing here at the absolute range lows without any breaking of the below support ($8.82) in over 1 year, means price will go higher quickly. 

There is a tiny gap at 16.27 that has to be closed. So that‚Äôs why I say once this goes up it will go üöÄüöÄüöÄquickly.

For reference sake, I saw the same thing I see now on WBD in Jan of 2023. Those options did 5 x in one week. Not to mention‚Ä¶ We have been range trading for over a year and a half. That‚Äôs bananas. 

This chart gives us parabolic potential on returns. This WILL go above $78 sooner than we think. The thing is if it gets there fast (WSB supports this) or we get there immediately. Either way. The charts don‚Äôt lie and I will be profiting all the way up on this one.

Footnote: Their Earnings Call is tomorrow at 8am. 

As explosive as this breakout will be to the upside, buying the cheapest options will be explosive with the profits. 

I anticipate it will hit 16.27 within the first 2 months (that‚Äôs 2x even though I really think the first 3 weeks for a 20x return, but I will be conservative). 

I purchased the following long calls:

-June 21 $30 @$.01 
      -If price jumps short term to 16.27, these options will be the first to cash out.

-Jan 2025 $30 @.06 
       -If we move a bit slower, my target is $30 for these options 

 -Jan 2026 $25 @$.39
        - I am buying these in case the WSB community sees what I see here and we shoot to push this to a new high.

I‚Äôm certain everyone has an options calculator so please DYOR. I am happy to answer any questions. 

I don‚Äôt have a cat meme, but this is definitely a Harry Potty meme. His wand was made of Holly Wood and made magic at the movies. So let‚Äôs make our own hit and get rich from the movies WITHOUT being a celebrity!

TLDR: Originally invested at $6.70 and averaged up when consolidating accounts. It is for $10.3K with 1,105 shares at a $9.31 average. I'm now in for $650.00 of call options as well.

Since learning about the Intuitive Machines mission to the moon, I've been very bullish regarding the stock for LUNR. If you have not invested in this stock, you might want to give it a look today since they are about to make history. Here are my top 10 reasons why you should consider LUNR or LUNRW.

Background: IM-1 is the second US-based Commercial Lunar Payload Services lander mission since Apollo 17 on December 11, 1972.

The first mission was Peregrine Mission One by Astrobotic Technology, Inc. The mission launched on January 8, 2024, and just hours after launch, the Astrobotics team confirmed the mission was in jeopardy. They identified issues with orienting the spacecraft for charging the batteries and a propellant leak. With the unsolvable propellant leak, the Astrobotics team abandoned the mission and performed a controlled re-entry over the South Pacific on January 18th under the advisement of NASA and the space community. Peregrine Mission One never left Earth orbit.

IM-1 Mission Facts

1. First Commercial Lunar Payload Services mission to launch using a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. \[February 15, 2024\]
2. Successfully fired the first liquid methane and liquid oxygen engine in space. \[February 16, 2024\]
3. First US-based mission to successfully leave Earth orbit (successful trans-lunar insertion). \[February 15, 2024\]
4. First Commercial Lunar Payload Services mission to successfully transmit images to Earth during its transfer orbit. \[February 16, 2024\]
5. Completed two trajectory correction maneuvers. The second burn was completed with enough precision to eliminate needing a third burn. \[February 20, 2024\]
6. First US-based mission to successfully enter Lunar orbit (successful lunar orbit insertion). \[February 21, 2024\]
7. The mission is making international headlines across multiple news outlets after successfully orbiting the moon. \[February 21, 2024\]
8. The mission managers and flight controllers have done an excellent job handling this mission's guidance, navigation, and control. After lunar orbit insertion, they performed corrective burns to optimize overall efficiency and improve the estimated landing time twice, from 16:30 CT to 15:26 CT. \[February 22, 2024\]
9. The stock has shown a significant improvement after the most recent update from Intuitive Machines, which provided an earlier-than-expected landing time for the second time. Rising 12.25% from $8.99 to $10.11 within 1 hour and 23 minutes. Currently, the stock is trending near $9.00/share as of 3:00 PM ET. \[February 22, 2024\]
10. Intuitive Machines is an American-based company based in Houston, TX. Do you need any more persuasion other than investing in an American company that is just hours away from landing on the moon?",2024-02-22,0

260,AMKOR ‚Äì AMKR ‚Äì Is an absolute bargain at today‚Äôs price and is an AI boom stock for the future,35,1axfo1r,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1axfo1r/amkor_amkr_is_an_absolute_bargain_at_todays_price/,34,"  

Let‚Äôs face it ‚Äì this AI boom isn‚Äôt going away any time soon. I say this as a guy who had decided entirely that he missed the NVDA train, then proceeded to YOLO a $700 call right before close yesterday (then panic sell it for a $2500 win, but $2300 less than I could have sold it for if I held it a mere 20 minutes longer), I‚Äôm officially convinced that AI is the next mega growth space in the market. 

AI requires chips. NVDA has somewhere in the neighborhood of 90% of the market of these GPU‚Äôs, something that doesn‚Äôt appear will be challenged in the immediate future. While many of the other major tech players have decided they are going to enter the space ‚Äì this isn‚Äôt a process that happens particularly quickly, and I think it is reasonable to expect that NVDA‚Äôs dominance in this space should continue for at least the next couple of years. 

The US has a desperate need for independence in the semiconductor space, and AMKOR is a company that will help take us there. 

The pandemic was an absolute screaming example of why we need more control over the chip supply chain ‚Äì as chip shortages caused supply chain debacles that brought many electronic industries to a halt (the auto industry as well). The resulting inflation created by this issue (among any other issues) was pronounced enough that Biden initiated what I believe to be the most important and prominent success of his administration thus far ‚Äì the CHIPS and Science act ‚Äì pledging to give something like $39 billion in grants/incentives to US based across the supply chain to bolster domestic production capabilities. 

Once a chip is manufactured, or at least the ones required for AI tasks, they are required to be packaged via a process called CoWoS ‚Äì or Chip on Wafer on Substrate. This process is fairly complex, and there aren‚Äôt many companies worldwide that are able to package this way currently. Contrary to popular believe ‚Äì the ‚ÄúChips Shortgage‚Äù that we have faced in recent years isn‚Äôt actually a shortage of chips ‚Äì but rather the inability to package chips using CoWoS quick enough to keep up with the absolutely insane demand.

TSMC ‚Äì Taiwain Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ‚Äì is far and away the largest current packager for CoWoS chips (they actually manufacture NVDA chips as well, but that‚Äôs an entirely different wall of text all together. NVDA has actually built a moat of sorts around the GPU chip industry). However ‚Äì there are several major problems with NVDA‚Äôs reliance on TSMC for chip packaging. 

* TSMC cannot currently keep up with the demand. Not even close. This was reiterated by their chairman as recently as September, and he has stated it will be several years before they can keep up with the NVDA CoWoS needs. 
* Even if TSMC could keep up with NVDA‚Äôs needs (they can‚Äôt) ‚Äì there are tons of other major players entering this space that have a need for CoWoS packaging ‚Äì which will further create demand for more packaging facilities. 
* TSMC currently manufacture all almost all their chips in Taiwan. While they have agreed to new plants in Germany, Japan, China, and the United States, Taiwan‚Äôs national security considerations (and the US‚Äô interest in this as well) mean they will likely continue to manufacture their most advanced chips in Taiwan. They‚Äôve actually had to get approval from the US government to manufacture/package their less advanced chips at their two facilities in China. 
* TSMC will always have the imminent threat of action that China decides to take. This is likely as big of a catalyst for the Chips Act as the supply chain shortages were. The US doesn‚Äôt want to be reliant on what China decides to do or not do in regards to Taiwan when it comes to our chips. 

All of these items leave a massive opportunity for new players to enter the space, and I believe AMKOR will be a major player that fills that role in the future. 

There are many reasons why I‚Äôm bullish on AMKR specifically, but I‚Äôve outlined a few of the major reasons below. 

* AMKR is the only US based company currently that has the ability to package CoWoS chips. The Biden administration has repeatedly stated again and again how important it is for the US to have the ability to package chips domestically. 
* AMKR is 55 years old. They have stood the test of time. They aren‚Äôt some brand-new start up that is entirely dependent on debt or issuing massive amounts of new shares to fund their growth. 
* AMKR actually pays a dividend making it attractive to boomers as well. It‚Äôs dividends have also purely been covered by free cash flow ‚Äì amounting to just 18% of its free cash flow last year. They have also increased this dividend by 25 % each year on average. 
* AMKR liabilities have been decreasing every year as a percent of their assets. 
* AMKR has a strong balance sheet, with free cash continuing to grow every year. 
* AMKR has started development of a massive manufacturing and packaging facility in Peoria, Arizona ‚Äì building a $2bb plant there that will have 500k sq ft of ‚Äòclean room space.‚Äô
* AMKR expanded their already existing partnership with Apple for Chip packaging in November. Apple has already pledged to be the first and largest customer of said plant. Through this partnership, Apple has already worked extensively on the strategic vision and manufacturing capabilities for said facility in Peoria. 
* AMKR has applied for a grant from the Chips act to develop said facility. I believe they will get said grant. 
   * a. As I mentioned previously, they are currently the only US company with CoWoS capability. This is important to the Biden administration. 
   * b. James Joo-Jin Kim (whose family founded AMKR, and who are the largest shareholders currently), have a lot of ties to Penn. Biden has a lot of ties to Penn. While I haven‚Äôt found any direct relationship between the two, I would like to believe that if Biden has an leverage on where these grants are dispersed, AMKR is ‚Äòlikable‚Äô in this sense. 
* AMKR‚Äôs current market cap is only $7bb. Plenty of room for this baby to run, especially given its segment. 
* And finally, best for last, AMKR surged in June upon rumors that NVDA was directly helping AMKR with packaging solutions for CoWoS AI Chips. Amkor 2.5D chip packaging nearly doubled from 3,000 wafers monthly in early 2023, to 5,000 by year end, and projections of 7,000 by end of 2024. 80% of these are for NVDA. 

That‚Äôs all I have for today. I‚Äôve burned 1.5 hours of my work day typing this out. I am normally an ‚Äúinvest in the 401k,‚Äù day trade lotto plays type of guys. For the foreseeable future, I intend on acquiring more and more shares of AMKR stock, and continuing to buy Options as far out in the future as I can ‚Äì currently stacking the 09/20 $35 Calls. My hope is that AMKR will get increased attention through a grant from the CHIPS act, production beginning on their new facility, an official partnership with NVDA, and reports of increased chip packaging production, leaps will open up that I can begin acquiring as well. 

TL:DR ‚Äì AI Stocks go rocketship boooom. AMKR has yet to truly lift off. Plenty of catalysts to send it to the moon. ",2024-02-22,0

305,Hi I'm the guy that bought $25k of $RIVN at ~$15.40,1927,1ax9qat,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ax9qat/hi_im_the_guy_that_bought_25k_of_rivn_at_1540/,818,"Couple of quick things to kick us off here before you start SCREAMING like you LOVE TO DO:

1. Ouch. Hug me.
2. I bought at the wrong time.
3. I didn't invest money I wasn't ready to lose and I'm not emotional about volatility / downs with this investment. 
4. I think Rivian is a great long term hold and that they're doing just about everything right given the circumstances.

Phew. Okay. Now, yesterday's earnings had a lot bad news. But it also had a lot of good news. Let's start there for fun.

* Reasserted guidance that it plans to be profitable by Q4 (assuaging concerns from *some people* on Twitter who are projecting Rivian runs out of cash in six quarters; they will also be able to restructure debt with lower interest rates)
* R2 launch on March 7th. Even more is riding on this now. And in the earnings call they mentioned R2 as the future of the company consistently and frequently.
* YoY per-vehicle loss is way down. \~$81k improvement. 
* Leasing has begun for R1T and R1S.
* Exceeded all aspects of guidance for 2023.
* YoY revenue increase of 167%.
* Additional, lower-priced variants of the R1.
* Lower cost basis with reduction of staff.
* Planned 30% plant efficiency in 2H in 2024.
* Better partnership with suppliers reduce variable cost per vehicle.
* Extremely strong brand, literally the strongest auto brand in 2023 according to Consumer Reports.
* Opportunity for additional revenue through subscription model that will offer ongoing improvements to the platform ‚Äî including entertainment and vehicle capabilities. 
* Top selling EV over $70k.

https://preview.redd.it/d781gmber5kc1.png?width=1618&format=png&auto=webp&s=763b91221dff177d970f128dad1e2e69d57a5c08

But, some of that good news also has bad news associated with it. Here's the other side of some double edged swords before getting into the bad, bad news.

* Gross loss per vehicle actually increased QoQ, from a loss of $30,648 per car in Q3 2023 to $43,372 per car in Q4, 2023 (lower deliveries)
* Those efficiency gains at the plant and new suppliers mean that the plant has to shut down for several weeks in Q2.

And now the bad, bad news that I don't like.

* Rivian is guiding that they will not produce more vehicles than they produced last year: 57,000. Deliveries can still increase YoY and they'll use existing inventory during that plant shut down, but yeesh. That's not what people want to see.
* Deliveries were down in Q4. A lot of people are speculating softer demand for the vehicles overall (which is likely true as RJ himself said that people reserved vehicles with different financing expectations), but I think the real issue here is that Amazon deferred delivery of their EDVs until 2024. It would appear the margins on EDV are preeeetty good and that deferral contributed to their increased gross loss per vehicle. Rivian guided that Q4 will see fewer deliveries for future quarters.
* R2 launch is two years away. It's gonna be sorta rough for Rivian until then I think, but hopefully, at worst, pretty flat.
* Interest rates are very rough and a lot of Rivian's future demand depends on cutting rates.

https://preview.redd.it/yjnwxp9fr5kc1.png?width=2236&format=png&auto=webp&s=5293608b2b630779a9f8f6a5302278efc325b9d4

That's not a lot of bullet points, but I think it all boils down to those four points overall. 

One of the most interesting parts of the Shareholder Letter was why Rivian believes they'll be profitable by Q4 2024: ""We believe our success driving significant reduction in the costs of our vehicles during 2023 positions us to achieve modest gross profit in the Q4 of 2024. The key drivers to bridge the fourth quarter 2023 to the fourth quarter of 2024 are:

*  \~50% - Variable cost per unit 
* \~35% - Fixed/semi-fixed cost efficiencies 
* \~15% - Non-vehicle revenue""

I'm still bullish on Rivian. This is a pivotal moment for EVs. And a rough one for autos in general. I think the best thing to do is sit back and wait ‚Äî and while I maybe didn't enter at the *optimal* time ‚Äî I think looking at a long term graph 4 years from now will show that it wasn't the worst time. Again, I think so much of this rides on the R2.",2024-02-22,0

Although this path could change, there has been no alteration so far. My concern is that the situation will escalate: Rivian lost $43,372 for every vehicle delivered in Q4 2023, marking an increase from the $30,000 loss per vehicle in Q3. Moreover, they are on the brink of introducing a second unprofitable car. It's a situation of scale or perish. The GA plant is on hold due to a lawsuit, and the company has announced a 10% workforce reduction. Regarding car warranties, what happens when brands like Rivian, which lack dealership networks, face no prospects of acquisition, raising concerns about their ability to honor warranties before depleting their financial reserves? Fellow Autists run for the hills!

CEO‚Äôs name is Ernest Garcia III btw, yes you read that right. Ernest Garcia THE THIRD. You know how much pressure this guy has to continue the Ernest Legacy? They aint going bankrupt. Im long on this one folks

**WBD** \- I have subscriptions to Disney+, HBO Max, Prime, Netflix, and Skyshowtime. HBO Max is by far the one I use the least. This fucking boomer app's UI is just so slow, they got shitty movies, and I can‚Äôt name a single show they put out that‚Äôs good (except for Succession and GOT, but both endings were rushed and disappointing).

So Im into Nvidia, yesterday I bought a call on Nvidia. Because I was a 100 % sure, that Nvidia would get way higher Sales volume, than the 20 Billion predicted. (Based on the last few quarterly/yearly earning reports and me not finding a reason why they would be weaker this quartal)
Today in Germany market opened a Hour ago, with Nvidia being 12 % up and my First option making 100 % over Night.

Data:
Nvidia Price when I bought it: 670 
Strike Price: 660
Leverage: 10x
optionprice: 4,5
Expirationdate: 15.03.24

I found this one and did a bit of math and imo it was the best Call available.

Meta ( deal size ~18B USD)
Google
Amazon Aws
Microsoft
Hugging face
Tesla
Open AI
Lot of companies in Dubai
Lot of companies in China
Lot of companies in India 
A lot of startups.

All of these are Billions of dollars worth of deals, in late 2025 we will see dip in revenue if any. Profit margins of Nvidia are very healthy, more than any software company, so we are looking at 50-60B usd in net profits this year. 

All the companies are Ramping up their chip design division, there is huge influx on money in areas related to accelerated computing and AI. It would be hard for companies to beat Nvidia in accelerated computing, unless it is a new startup under a great leader. Legacy companies suffer from beurocracy. It would be a same bet as when Nvidia tried to compete with Qualcomm and had to pull back. 
It is not about AI workloads on servers, but the way computation is evolving, we might have better graphics on websites as well, softwares will start to run fast which rely on few threads. Someone will find new utility, thus pushing tech further for the whole ecosystem.

Coming to dot com crash, there is a chance that companies go bust and demand for data centre chips fall, but that frezy might not happen for next 2-3 years, interest rates would come down, we will see a lot of VC money, and then companies will go bust. For Nvidia to cisco, there is some time left.

Even if this number was **flat** for each quarter of the coming year (and it will *obviously* grow, since their **demand > supply**), they are currently trading at, based on a current share price of $729, a forward PE ratio of 32.4. Their revenue for the calendar year was up 126%, while their net income was up 286%.

Microsoft is currently trading at a forward P/E ratio of 34.72. Their revenue for the fiscal year was up 7% YoY, while net income was up 6% YoY.

Tesla's forward PE ratio is 62.13; do they have anything similar when it comes to growth prospects? No. In the prior quarter, their revenue was up 8% YoY and their net income was down 44%.

363,Complex arbitrage deadline-fueled trade,3,1awrso9,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1awrso9/complex_arbitrage_deadlinefueled_trade/,3,"I bought $siri shares on Friday, but then I realized I made a mistake. So I switched from $siri to $lsxmk (same as $lsxma / $lsxmb $lsxm, which are vehicles that hold $siri shares at a 23% discount). Used those savings to buy effective $siri shares via $lsxmk (again at a 23% discount) and $siri $4 and $5 calls in case it pops. The arbitrage margin minus the $siri borrow fee is low. 

That means the short leg of the arbitrage ($siri) needs to be bought to close the arbitrage. But the long leg also needs to be bought to close the 23% discount to $siri, as the date nears for $lsxmk to convert to 8.4 shares of $siri (early q3). So my bet is that both legs of the arbitrage go up, since the narrow arbitrage margin and hefty borrow fee makes it less risky to just buy $lsxma to get $siri at a discount. That narrows the discount more, which makes traders close more of the arbitrage by buying $siri, and so on.

I don't need to go in depth, this has been explained by a lot of people already. This is a bubble, the fundamentals are fake.

However, it will keep growing bigger and bears will continue getting fucked while they cry that it's a bubble.

Big tech will be able to keep the degenerate fake fundamentals growing long enough for AI startups to start going IPO. That is when the next stage of the bubble will begin. We are nowhere near the top. This is dotcom bubble 2.0 on steroids.

The fed will cut rates because they don't give a fuck about this bubble. They want to stimulate the economy in order to drive more labor participation. In the current fed's view, maximum employment means increasing labor participation. So this is happening and it will be a great environment the next stage of the bubble.

When these startups go IPO it will allow VCs to cash out and fund more startups. This will bring new capital into the bubble so that it's not purely sustained by big tech companies degeneracy. That will allow it to last much longer than bears expect.

On the off chance that this whole thing becomes a useful, productive industry, then we will get a permanently higher plateau. Otherwise it will pop horribly at some point.

I'm 87 and immobile in a wheelchair and don't know anything about semiconductors or anything else technology related. I cannot Google or text, and I currently have someone who lives in my home 24/7 and wipes my ass for me. However, I'm a damn intuitive savant when it comes to tricking gullible kids.

I did grow up in the biggest bull market in human history with some Boomers printing money like Chuck E. Cheese bucks.. and everyone is a genius in a bull market.. Well almost everyone. I didn't invest so now I just scam Millennials and Zoomers.

Anyway, I like talking stocks with my grandson because it‚Äôs something we could connect on, and I have a ton of experience selling worthless advice to idiots. So in 2018 we were talking about the market, and I casually brought up Nvidia. He thought I didn't guide him to that at all. He bought Nvidia in 2017 so he was familiar with it although he bought his shares at 18 yrs old with $2k he had saved up. Nothing insane although he kept 90% to this day. I said I saw NVIDIA in a newspaper article with someone recommending it for elderly‚Äôs retirement accounts. So I told my grandson I was an OGangster, called my broker and bought 1,000 shares on the spot because in my words: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt buy a stock if I can‚Äôt afford 1,000 shares‚Äù. Something only the Zoomers dumb enough to buy meme stocks would fall for. 

He was dumbstruck because here he thought he was doing great with his savings over the years, and I just humbled his ass with a completely made up sentence. Add in the 4:1 stock split, and now he thinks I'm sitting on 4,000 shares. (I ""confirmed"" it to him when he brought it up in the last month). I haven't sold a dime and don't even know what the price is doing day to day because I don't own any shares.  I'm just chilling in my wheelchair and letting him try to get a bigger share of the inheritance. He called and celebrated with me the other day because he transparently wants to get in my will. He thinks I'm already wealthy and dumb enough to drop 6 figures on a stock I know little about.

He hopes to inherit my wealth someday, but he‚Äôs also a scammy, golddigging SOB and he knows it! Told me ‚Äúhaha you're a genius investor and luck has nothing to do with‚Äù.

Years ago, I told my 18 year grandson about a stock (NVDA) that could be a good long term purchase as he had just gotten into finance and was watching Graham Stephan to learn more about being financially literate and things he could do to help his future retirement.  Long story short, he disregards my advice and does fuck knows what with his graduation money.  

Fast forward to Covid, he‚Äôs collecting unemployment and using stim checks on call options and is making money calling me and telling me tickers that he thinks would be a extremely profitable.  Some examples are he projected NKLA to be $150+, Game Stop was a good buy at $300+, and the list goes on.  To his surprise, in 2022 he got wiped out and his parents reluctantly let him move back in to help him get back on his feet.

During this time period, he would constantly call me and tell me about things that could pop off and if only he had some money he could invest to make some of the money back.  This led to him showing up uninvited to my home and trying to kiss my ass to solicit a loan or potentially trying to ‚Äúsecure‚Äù his spot in my will.  

With all these unsolicited visits, I had to pretend that I was ill and no longer able to use my smartphone as he would constantly ask me to Zelle or Venmo him money and that if he were to come he would have to clean up after me.  As a result the visits stopped but at this point I believe he is just hoping I croak soon.

Hey guys,

Flair should be right, it‚Äôs more a discussion of a regarded idea than an actual DD !

 I'm really excited about Nvidia today, not so much for Nvidia itself, but for the potential knock-on effects it could have on other companies.

 Nvidia has a big problem: production. TSMC can't keep up with demand, and this is where UMC could come in.

 I think it's possible that Nvidia will soon announce a production partnership with UMC, which could send UMC's stock price soaring in the next day or so.

 I just opened a small position in UMC (ADR), A0M2R4. ($UMCB)

 This is just a loose idea and I don't have any deep insights or anything other than this article: https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/analysts-unveil-new-nvidia-price-targets-as-key-earnings-report-looms

 However, I think the risk is manageable due to the lack of leverage.

Disclaimer: I am not providing legal or financial advice, just giving my opinion as I see it. I am just providing my observations based off the ruling and where I see things potentially developing from here and how I think there is value in the options on the stock as a novice investor. 

As most know, the Spirit Airlines ($SAVE) and JetBlue Airways ($JBLU) was blocked via a Federal ruling back in January. The 113 page opinion can be found here:

https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.254267/gov.uscourts.mad.254267.461.0.pdf


It was appealed and initial briefs are due this coming Monday by the airlines. Arguments are tentatively set for June. It‚Äôll be heard in the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals. As an initial matter, I want to illustrate the value that $Save options have at current prices just from a rough statistical viewpoint. 

Official records show that in the 1st Circuit, 17.4% of cases get reversed involving the US Govt. 

https://www.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/data_tables/jb_b5_0930.2022.pdf

That percentage is largely in lockstep with the average across all circuits of appeals involving the Federal government (12.5%). 

https://www.sixthcircuitappellateblog.com/news-and-analysis/reversal-rates-in-the-sixth-circuit-and-elsewhere/#:~:text=This%20post%20provides%20the%20latest,the%20United%20States%20at%2012.5%25.

You can argue that actually ~40% more cases are reversed in the 1st Circuit than the average but I think the more relevant data point is that 1 out of 6 cases get reversed as opposed to 1 out of 8. With that being said, from a purely statistical standpoint, we can attribute an approximate 17% chance the merger will go through due to reversal. Curiously enough the stock is trading at about 19% of its proposed merger price ($6.50 vs $33.50).
 
The deadline to securing financing on the deal is July 24, and even though it would be a quick turnaround for the Court, given the magnitude of the deal, I believe an opinion will be issued in the 11th hour prior to that financing deadline. Allowing for either a hard July 24 deadline or a small extension of 2-3 weeks, I am looking at Aug 16 calls as an initial target expiry on my options. 

Aug16 12.5c are currently trading at about $0.70 per contract. Based off the data we have, a Fair Market Value of a Aug 16 12.5c should be $3.50. Why? Because at that price point, a merger price of $33.50 a stock would be 5x your money, which is the return you would need on a 17% chance bet to make sense. With calls trading at about $0.70, the return is 57x your money. 

It‚Äôs important to note plenty of factors will dictate your return. Even after a ruling, the stock will likely trade at a discount, so the $33.50 is the best case scenario assuming the deal goes through in August. Recent examples are Twitter going private and the Capital One and DFS merger announcement as both traded at a discount of the announced purchase price. Until the ink is on the paper there is always risk and that risk will take the form of a discount on the stock. I do believe that the discount will be fairly minimal assuming a reversal, as the antitrust case is the single greatest obstacle for the merger. 

If you think there is a greater than 1.75% chance (1/57) of the merger going through as proposed by August 16, a Save 12.5 call is the play. This call will also likely be ITM regardless of the closing date of the merger by August 16 if the case gets reversed. The stock was trading over $16 until the opinion was issued. It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if it shoots back up there almost immediately. 

Now to the opinion and why I think there‚Äôs a greater than 1.75% chance (or 17% for that matter) of the case getting overturned and I make money at the same time. 

I read the 113 page opinion. I found it illogical at times with what the judge was saying, the weight he was giving certain facts and experts, and the outcome. Might just call it a gut feeling, but the ruling seems wrong based off the facts in the opinion and the history behind airline mergers. The opinion seems to indicate that Spirit is essentially merge proof to a certain extent. Because it‚Äôs such an ‚Äúinnovator‚Äù and an ultra low cost provider (ULCC) that it is being punished by not being allowed to merge because it‚Äôs unique in its low fares. I find it hard to believe that the Court will ultimately decide that a bankrupt/out of business company is a better alternative to allowing the 6th and 7th largest airlines to merge in the name of the consumer. It‚Äôs likely Spirit would be facing a Chapter 11 bankruptcy if this deal falls through and no new suitor presents itself. Also it would be hypocritical of the Court to a certain extent given that the AA and US Airways merger was with the 3rd and 6th largest airline at the time just a decade ago. No two mergers are the same but it just feels‚Ä¶off. With that being said, this is where I see things going in the near and mid future. I found this interesting graphic of airline sizes over the years that takes into account mergers. 

https://americanbusinesshistory.org/americas-largest-airlines-1950-1980-in-two-animated-charts/

How I‚Äôm playing the next couple months:

1. Spirit/JetBlue briefs for their appeal are due February 26th by 5pm. These briefs are public record and I believe the briefs will be a positive for both airlines. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if $Save sees a noticeable bump on Monday and through the week.

My play: 3/1 $Save $6.5 Calls. Originally it was $7 calls but the price dip today made me adjust my price point and limit the downside of a call. This will be something I plan to get in and out of. It‚Äôs possible the price might pop and stay elevated. This is a low to moderate confidence play given the short timeline but buying a cheap weekly call for a 10% price increase could print a nice return. 

2. US Govt Responses are due by April 11. Like the Feb 26th brief, this could see a drop in price depending on the strength of the briefs. 

My play: Wait and see. If there is any validity in the 3/1 play, I will either sit on the sideline or maybe play a short term put that will be a quick in and out.

3. Fully briefed by April 25th. I don‚Äôt see this having any effects on the market. Reply‚Äôs are usually just regurgitating your initial response.

4. Arguments to be heard in June with a ruling after that. The court has strongly discouraged extensions which is legal code for don‚Äôt ask otherwise I‚Äôll be pissed. It seems everyone is aware on the Court of the July 24 financing deadline for the agreement so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if we get a ruling in the 11th hour close to that date. 

My play: I am loading up on various long term calls currently for 8/16 and 9/20. If the proposed merger goes through, share prices will be valued at approximately $33.50 per share. I‚Äôd expect it to trade at a slight discount but my calls will be conservative in relation to the merger price as it‚Äôs hard to know what will happen next in the event the ruling is overturned. I will consider adding further dated calls depending on what happens on July 24 in the event no opinion is issued and a financing extension is granted. If no extension is granted, my overall theory is likely dead in the water anyways. I‚Äôll reevaluate once we get there. 


Potential catalysts to the stock in the interim:

1.Q1 Earnings April 24

I will sit the sidelines on this earnings report. At the end of the day, it will all come down to the Courts. Q3 Earnings reported a couple weeks ago was all positive and the bump in stock was short lived. There is just too much unknown around the stock for a positive ER to create any sort of sustainable bump. I hope I‚Äôm wrong as it will only benefit my long term calls but I will be sidelined for this. 

2.Pratt Whitney Engine recall settlement/insurance payout

It‚Äôs hard to put a timeline on something like this, but there is a very real possibility Spirit will experience a windfall of cash from these recalls. This could result in a bump in stock as it bolsters Spirit‚Äôs liquidity even further (spirit sold 25 aircrafts and did a leaseback on them in order to pay $400m in debt and net $400m in cash). This result would help any long term outlook for the company and stock but this would be something I would look to play in a Q2 or Q3 2024 ER after the Court ruling. 

My play: Q2 or Q3 ER pending the outcome of the merger appeal. 


Overall the strategy is quite simple: I know better than a Harvard educated US District judge who‚Äôs been on the bench for 45 years. Spirit and JetBlue will get the green light to merge and the stock goes 4x in a matter of days close to the purchase price of the merger.

420,A Better Plan For Reddit's IPO & Inducing User-Shareholders,0,1awm61z,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1awm61z/a_better_plan_for_reddits_ipo_inducing/,20,"The news I read about Reddit's plan to attempt to get 75,000 users to buy-in to their IPO is likely to be counter-productive to the company's goals. Average amount these users may stand to buy-in I am approximating at about $1,000/each. That would yield about $75,000,000, which would be nice but insufficient because their goal is to start out with a $5B - $10B valuation, which means this crop of potential shareholders would own \~1% of the new company. No voting rights. No control. No way.

Also, the types of users they are talking about have likely been on the platform for about \~10 years on average, working essentially for free to raise the value of this company, as if they were in a startup.

If instead, the company were to court \~1,000 users of this nature, and compensate them as if they were working for sweat equity in a startup, at an average salary-rate of $100,000/year (with a decade being the average time horizon) it would yield a valuation of those users' shares at about $1B, and if they were given 5% equity in the company it would impute a valuation on the IPO of \~$20,000,000,000 which is much more attractive for other investors than a company worth >half of what SNAP is worth.

By comparing the value of the Reddit subs to the trash-heap of Twitter, and using Elon Musk's ridiculous buy-price of $44B, compensating for the fact that Musk said his own bad leadership tanked the value of the company -50% since he took it private, Reddit would launch their IPO as a more valued social media company than Snap, Pinterest, and Twitter on an individual basis, which is dope.

That kind of news should increase the value of the IPO over the first few quarters to rise to the Twitter merger price, doubling values for the early investors, including those power users, whose $1M worth of stock could be worth $2M quickly, enabling them to ride the wave or cash-out with plenty of liquidity from people who put in to capitalize on a new publicly traded social media company.

Meta being valued at over a trillion again, while being a flaming pile of crap, means that there is an insane amount of upside to bring new investment into a Reddit as a publicly traded stock.

Reddit may steal this thesis, and if they do, it'd be nice if they gave me a piece of the pie for my trouble. If they don't steal this thesis, Reddit could be delisted as fast as it enters the market.

If they do steal this thesis, and give me nothing, I'll again learn the lesson, ""no good deed goes unpunished."" But I'd like to see Reddit continue existing, and not turn into an unmitigated cesspool.

* SP500 and NAS100 are at a peak and have grown exponentially over the past few months, also disproportionately through NVIDIA. A cooldown seems necessary.

* NVIDIA has a P/E ratio of over 90; of course, expectations are very high, and expectations should indeed be very high since NVIDIA is the undisputed market leader for AI chips.

In summary, it is a mathematical decision for me. I love this stock; I have had it in my portfolio for 4 years now. Purely emotionally, I should not have sold the stock, but mathematically, I see it as the stock correcting by 70%, with a 30% chance of further rise, with the short-term upside potential (1 to 2 weeks) being significantly lower than the downward movement if certain parts are not fully met upon the announcement of the figures.

I wish all investors good luck! 

-------------------------------

Edit: 
It seems like my mathematical mind made the wrong decision; the emotional decision would have been economically better. Nonetheless, I‚Äôm glad NVIDIA exceeded expert estimates as this will have signaling effects on the market for the next weeks, perhaps even months in the IT-sector. 

Bye, we‚Äôll catch up before the next quarterly earnings when it‚Äôs time for the next round of put vs. call ;)

------------------------------

Edit2: 
The figures were outstanding - I bought back my shares this morning - I am on that boat again! 

Am i frustrated that i missed some %? From my perspective, with my assessment, my decision was mathematically/statistically correct. However, the numbers have shown that the party can last much longer than I assumed - to all bears: feel free to join the call-bull party, there are still a few tickets available - better be quick!

At this time, my mom was drinking a lot of Diet RC, a smaller competitor to coke and pepsi.  I started seeing it a bit more at walmart cash register fridges so I decided to research that stock which ended up being COTT (now PRMW) .  After that research I figured out they made several other brands like stars and stripes and other sodas.  That was enough for me.  I told my dad to buy roughly 1k worth of COTT in the spring of 2009 which was worth around 1000 shares.  By the end of the year the stock shot up from \~$1 to over $9.  We sold for over 800% return.  My first trade ever ended up being my best trade so far lmfao.  Anyways my dad kept all the profits and used it to buy more stocks for himself.  I didn't get a single penny.

HOWEVER, recent actions from the CCP prove they want to bolster retail investors by protecting them from hedge funds and trying to prop up the stock market dismissing the fears of willingness to nationalize.

So I'm wondering whether the Nanox will be the good bet now on your opininios.

So, we have several factors:

Nvidia investments and big hype.

Nanox also received FDA clearance for early liver disease detection. While using innovative x-ray technology and cloud-based systems, it improves global access to imaging, supported by AI software for clinicians.

And besides, they have resolved another deal with arc. You may remember that Nano-X tried to get FDA approval for its Nanox.ARC in June 2021, saying it's safe. But tho FDA asked for more details in August and it was obvious that smth went wrong, and after all that investors filed a lawsuit against them and Nano-X recently decided to pay a [$8M settlement](https://11thestate.com/cases/nanox-investors-settlement) for this case.

I made this post [4 weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1992whu/stng_president_selling_i_am_selling_21k_gain_on/) about how STNG president had sold a shit ton of shares and thus I was out, well 4 weeks later news came out that he has bought [call options](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/scorpio-tankers-inc.-announces-purchase-of-call-options-by-the-president-of-the-8) for around the same notional amount of shares as he had originally sold off (to be exact he sold [703k shares](https://scorpiotankers.gcs-web.com/static-files/84e2f24f-927d-4a60-8dba-fb7fd0b7f49e) and he bought calls for 555k notional. The CEO of STNG also sold [419k shares](https://scorpiotankers.gcs-web.com/static-files/c9bffc95-740d-416a-8332-c2651c60b8d9) within the same week. I went through STNG's filings back thru 2020 and from what I can tell the c-suite has been vested with slightly over 2 million shares up until Jan 2024. I got really sketched out seeing that they sold half of their vested shares within the same week, what follows is complete speculation that could work really well or really poorly so good luck to all tailing me

I am speculating that the President and CEO sold their shares because they thought that the red sea would resolve quickly. In addition the plan for STNG for the next quarter was to stop share buy backs in order to pay down debt

&#x200B;

[As of Feb 13 2024 STNG was more than halfway through their planned debt repayments](https://preview.redd.it/2hpnffg8ryjc1.png?width=2245&format=png&auto=webp&s=83d8c2105d58272824537001719ba9812e1bdfbf)

Look here we are 4 weeks after the stock sales by president and CEO and if anything the situation seems to have gotten exponentially worse considering that the US has launched many air strikes all over Yemen and the Houthis are still able to [incapacitate ships](https://splash247.com/crew-abandon-bulk-carrier-after-houthi-missile-attack/). Some of you are saying right now that the US can easily bomb the region, well we have been doing it for almost 3 weeks now and it seems the Houthis still have capabilities so I don't think this is gonna be quite so easy to resolve. Anyways

The President Bugbee was extremely cagey when asked if buybacks were incoming since debt is being rapidly paid down.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4cpb48lqryjc1.png?width=1740&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e35d8bcd297b8c85918d6d4b637dc2ef1f1166f

I think Bugbee was so cagey about responding to whether or not buy backs would be coming back because he didn't want to be front ran on his options purchase, which he did 2 days after STNG earnings. 

Last time Bugbee purchased call options was Jan 4 2023

&#x200B;

[6 weeks after Bugbee's last call option purchase stock price was up 25&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/l2g3vty4syjc1.png?width=2254&format=png&auto=webp&s=b580e64fee25d2ba2ed4310146a44e1683dff032)

This is gonna be a rapidly evolving situation, risks are peace in the middle east, I also think there's some risk if [refineries keep getting blown up](https://www.reuters.com/world/oil-refinery-southern-russia-ablaze-news-agencies-quote-officials-2024-01-24/) since if there's no refined product to move then these ships don't make any money.

So It‚Äôs a $1B backlog company (mostly recognised before 2027) with a $2.3B market cap and healthy financials that could have a bigger better rocket fairly soon.

'Twas Friday the 16th of February, before a three day weekend. 

That morning, Gemini had just taken of his hardest exams yet (little did he know life would give him a bitch of a lesson). 

He went back home and started getting absolutely blasted as he waited until 4:30pm for the market to open (EET). 

He looked at the upcoming earnings releases for the week beginning February 19th, 2024, and he saw a little known company by the name of Walmart would have their earnings call Tuesday. 

He knew earnings would be good. Why? COSTCO m\*therf\*cker they had good earnings, so would Walmart. Besides, the recession doesn't exist it's merely a figment of üåàüêª's imagination. 

So at around 8pm, tired and drunk. I buy what I ***think*** are **100 WALMART** calls. I wish the story ended here and I just made a bunch of money.

But no my fellow regards, because instead of buying **$WMT** calls I bought fucking **$WAL** calls.

Of course I only realized this during the weekend. And Monday being a market holiday, meant I couldn't do jack shit until Tuesday after $WMT earnings call. 

Tuesday arrives, market opens. What do you think the first think I do is? Sell my $WAL calls? nooooo

I fucking FOMO into 100 $WMT calls when its at $180.

After I sell my $WAL at a loss.

I didn't even bother checking back to see how the $WMT calls were doing. Needless to say, wasn't the brightest fucking idea when IV crush was just gonna devalue the options. PLUS $WMT went back down to $175 and its still going down. NO way it actually hits my strike price. Today I decided to just cut my loses, my huge loses.

What am I trying to tell you with story. IF ANYTHING MAKE SURE YOU DOUBLE CHECK ITS THE RIGHT FUCKING TICEKR YOU ARE BUYING. 

Second thing would be not to buy calls after a stock just had a huge price move, but we both know you're still gonna do that. 

Third would be not to trade while drunk. But if you're gonna do that, leverage to the tits.

I will avoid the earnings release, as that's gambling IMO. But I will look to trade a smaller size once it settles after hours.¬†

So lets get right into the plays for today

First of all, my balls are too tiny to make a play on NVDA; bears and bulls are just poles apart tonight. Nevertheless, Ive got 4 other stocks that I'll be gambling on, 2 of which will be reporting right after the close, and the other 2 tomorrow morning:

&#x200B;

1. **NOVA** \- Take a mental walk with me: the sun is currently around 45 years old (if he were a human being), shining bright and just chilling. But, Mr. Sun will eventually run out of fuel (energy), leading to Mr. Sun puffing up like a balloon (red giant), and basically eating our little planet and KILLING US ALL (unless Elon saves us). Fuck the sun. Literally EVERY solar stock has been slaughtered. Btw this company beat earnings only 1 out of 4 times last year. SEDG shit the bed yesterday, so im very very very excited to short this stock tonight.
2. **NEM** \- Newmont Corporation mines gold in The Americas. These fucking dinosaurs still think it‚Äôs the 1850s; we all know everyone mines crypto these days. Gold price is flat since their last earnings, and speaking of their earnings, these guys missed 3/4 reports last year, just like NOVA‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. üåàüêª will win this one.
3. **W** \- Honestly this ticker says enough. Expect green dildos
4. **RIVN** \- Move over TSLA fanboys, there's a new kid in town. Rivian is increasing production and deliveries every quarter, reducing staff, the big Tesla superchargers deal last year, and their Amazon delivery vans are just cool AF. This stock has been hammered down bad, but looking at their 1Y chart, they keep fighting. Every time you think it's over, Rivian pumps 20-40%. Let‚Äôs hope this happens tonight as well. Today im a RIVN bull, but be cautious guys:

Etsy reports earnings tonight after close. I expect them to report bad numbers and have bought puts yesterday. 


**The marketplace is stagnating and only increasing revenue thanks to higher fees**


Since the first quarter of 2022, Etsy has faced declining rates in their Gross Merchandise Sales. In the latest quarter, they managed 3% annual growth, but GMS was still flat compared to Q3 of 2021 ‚Äì meaning 0 growth in 2 years.

They reacted quickly by increasing seller fees in Q2 of 2022, which you can clearly see on the chart led to a bump in their revenue growth rates.


While there were very public seller protests against the fee increase, Etsy ultimately went through with it, and predictably, all sellers remained on the platform. That‚Äôs because Etsy has become the No.1 marketplace for the kinds of goods they sell, so there really wasn‚Äôt a good alternative for any of their sellers. Sellers bit the bullet and stayed with the website.

**Competition from TikTok**

Enter TikTok, which has quickly become an extremely viable channel for typical Etsy products. The video format and discovery options on TikTok lend themselves perfectly to products typically sold on Etsy ‚Äì you can stumble on a video showing something cute and homemade, and immediately purchase the item through TikTok. Here‚Äôs a quote from an Etsy Seller on their Forums from October 29, 2023:

‚ÄúI don't have a TikTok but I know a few sellers in my category that do and are killing it with sales.  I agree we need something live here on Etsy to compete.‚Äù

The video and live formats on TikTok are simply much more appealing to modern customers compared to Etsy, which essentially works the same way as Amazon.

**Popular Etsy products are increasing in popularity on TikTok**


While Etsy doesn‚Äôt disclose their sales by product category, we can make an educated guess by visiting their ‚Äúbest selling items‚Äù website as well as other websites that make estimates:

https://www.etsy.com/market/best_selling_items

https://bloggingwizard.com/best-selling-items-on-etsy/

Without being able to quantify them, these are some of the best selling product categories on Etsy:

Jewelry, beads, pendants, etc.
Pins
Stickers
Books
T-Shirts


TikTok has offered these creators amazing terms by taking only a 2% commission on each sale (compared to 6.5% at Etsy) and paying for discounts on the products.

The screenshots show how search interest on TikTok has developed for some popular hashtags related to these product categories in the USA (all screenshots show global search interest over the past 3 years). 

Another sign of TikTok‚Äôs increasing popularity in this space is that they will be increasing their own fees on sales soon, to 6% per sale by April 1 and 8% by July 1 (which would be even higher than Etsy‚Äôs fees). TikTok‚Äôs parent company Bytedance is highly profitable, so it stands to reason that this move is not made out of desperation, but because they feel like they have taken a large amount of market share in this space. (https://www.theinformation.com/articles/tiktok-shop-hikes-seller-fees-axes-subsidies)

The total market for these sorts of custom goods is quite limited and, in my opinion, not growing that quickly overall. My assumption is that any sale made on TikTok for these goods is a sale that Etsy is losing, and this seems to be supported by data.

**Etsy Metrics are declining**


While Etsy continued to be a popular holiday destination for shoppers, their iphone download rank has plummeted in the new year compared to Q1 of 2023.


Website hits for Etsy.com decreased by 5-7% y-o-y in the past 3 months as per Similarweb (unfortunately I cannot show the data since I wrote down last years website views by hand, and Similarweb only shows the past 3 months to free users). 

**Risks**

A well known activist investor recently took a large stake in Etsy. There‚Äôs a risk that they could announce shareholder friendly steps during the earnings call, such as stock buybacks, divestitures, etc. Since the stake was only announced at the beginning of February 2024, I think the likelihood of concrete actions being announced is however low 

**My position**

Strike 70 puts expiring this week. As always you can go closer to the current stock price to minimize your risk. IV on Etsy is not particular high, with a 5.1% implied move in either direction.",2024-02-21,0

Sure AMD has some AI gpus but it's not popular or the go to choice for anyone in AI game.  Nvidia is synonymous to Neural Network training at this point. 

4) Most of the money they make, they re-invest in it research so they are ahead of competition by a wide margin.

5) If you used an ai model lately and you liked it, it was most likely trained on an nvidia gpu and inference also happened on an nvidia gpu.

(MPW), but with a twist that even the most diamond-handed, rocket-ship-riding, tendie-hunting WallStreetBets aficionado would appreciate.

Imagine MPW as the ultimate landlord, but instead of dealing with your noisy neighbors or fixing your leaky faucet, they‚Äôre in the big leagues of hospitals and healthcare facilities. Now, why should you, a savvy meme-stock enthusiast and potential financial astronaut, consider boarding the MPW rocket before its earnings blast off tomorrow morning?

1. Epic Discount on Space Tickets: Picture MPW‚Äôs assets like a fleet of Star Destroyers, valued at a galactic $8.28 billion. But here‚Äôs the kicker: the market is currently valuing this interstellar armada at a mere $2.04 billion. That‚Äôs like snagging a ticket to Mars for the price of a bus fare to the next town over. Absolute steal.

2. Price Drop = Moon Launch Prep: The stock price has plummeted from its Olympian heights of $19.76 per share down to a humbling $3.86. This isn‚Äôt just a sale; it‚Äôs Black Friday with a side of financial chaos. It‚Äôs as if the universe is giving you a cheat code for extra lives (or in this case, extra cash).

3. Tomorrow‚Äôs Earnings: The Slingshot Maneuver: Here‚Äôs where it gets spicy. MPW is about to drop its earnings report, and if they‚Äôve been cooking the books right (legally, of course), we could see a slingshot maneuver that propels this bad boy right past the moon, through the asteroid belt, and straight into the heart of the galaxy.

So, why toss your hard-earned cash into the MPW void? Because it‚Äôs undervalued, underappreciated, and poised for a potential interstellar journey worthy of a WallStreetBets saga. It‚Äôs like finding a rare, mint-condition meme in the wild: You know it‚Äôs going to be worth something to someone, somewhere, soon. Plus, let‚Äôs face it, nothing beats the thrill of the gamble, especially when you‚Äôre part of a crew that thrives on chaos, memes, and dreams of ludicrous wealth.

To the moon, fellow degenerates! And remember, this is not financial advice; it‚Äôs a rocket-fueled adventure. Buckle up, and may your portfolios fly as high as your spirits. üöÄ

Following the infallible investment strategy of going all-in on a hype-beast stock when it's at ATH - I took my hard-earned 25k and bought the March 1 1040 Calls on SMCI and watched my money evaporate. Yes, it wasn't as bad as the 70k 0DTE guy, but I think I have outperformed his ability to time the market.

Buying my calls at several different levels, I accepted an average somewhere in the range of $84.30. In shock at the immediacy of my loss, I accepted that the stock would never recover in time, and waited for the absolute bottom to come in so that I could close my position for a $23,000 loss.

\- Only to watch as it started to climb almost immediately after my sale and continue to do so all the way until market close. Guys, I timed the absolute top of this run and closed for as large of a loss as I possibly could. I am absolutely cursed and will live out my days knowing exactly what level of self-sabotage I am able to inflict upon myself.

It looks like the market is going to experience a lot of volatility and you know what that means: it's a great time to lose your life savings. In this beginner's guide I'll give you all the tips and tricks you need to reach peak degeneracy.

Step 1. Many of you have already done this, but some of you noobs haven't so you'll want to start here. As the markets go really high you want to buy stocks with the expectation they're going to keep rising. Preferably you want to put it all in one single company, like NVDA. You don't want to do a thing called ""DCA"" which is a way investors build wealth over time by buying into good companies and holding for years. In fact ""DCA"" is a slur in this sub, so I will refrain from using it in the future and I hope the mods can forgive me for saying it in this educational context.

Step 2. When the market has an inevitable correction to the down side you want to do this cool trick called ""panic selling."" Panic selling is this cool thing that causes you to stay up for nights on end thinking about your positions that keep going down. Now, because you bought stocks they aren't ever going to expire like options. 8 months from now your position that's down 20% will probably 2x in value. But we aren't thinking about the future. Heck, some of us can't think at all. Instead, you want to wait until your stocks are down like 30+% and then you immediately sell. This is going to cause a little depression because you lost money, but you'll feel a huge weight lifted off your shoulders. And you're going to be super happy once you follow step 3 of my 12 step program.

Step 3. Now I want to introduce you to this cool thing called options. You know that 30% we just lost? Well, the casino owes us money and we're about to make it back with these bad boys. Options are essentially legal contracts, so if you buy them it basically makes you a lawyer, or at least as smart as one in most cases. They let you control 100 shares of a company at a fraction of the cost for a set number of days. The options we want are called Puts. Puts let us make money as a stock goes down. So now because we have perfect timing with NVDA as we bought at the high and sold at the bottom, we want to use our perfect timing and buy puts on NVDA after it's down 30%. This way as it continues to go to 0 we can make lots of money back. Make sure to buy an option that's at least 30 days out so you have plenty of time to watch the numbers in your account change.

Step 4. If you want to use even more money, another cool thing you can do is use margin. Margin is essentially a loan that you borrow from a reputable broker like Robinhood and use exclusively to buy options. 

Step 5. Now that several weeks have gone by and NVDA has rebounded, your options have expired worthless and you now have no money. If you followed step 4 you actually have negative money, which means you can become a mod on wallstreetbets. 

In all seriousness. Just buy and hold good companies and you'll be fine, even if you buy at a high. And just don't bother with options if you're serious about building wealth or if you don't know what you're doing. Don't panic sell. Don't check the market. Just buy over the next few years and you'll be rich.

529,CRE & Regional Banks -- How to profit from CRE defaults.,31,1avr1uj,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1avr1uj/cre_regional_banks_how_to_profit_from_cre_defaults/,44,"Regional banks are the primary lender for commercial real estate and a lot of CRE are struggling to meet payments on these loans. As of 2024, Roughly **$1 TRILLION** of these loans are due for payment and with ""44% of office loans appearing 'underwater'"". So, now would be the time (if ever) to start betting on regional bank collapsing.

There's really only **one solution for CRE defaults** and that is lower rates which even then, doesn't mean demand will reverse course. At best, it lowers the amount they need to pay since many of these loans aren't fixed however, given where the fed is at with lower rates, it's not looking like it will happen for a while which is a major blow to many of these borrowers (credit to u/InverseMeForTendies). Lenders will realize that their losses will only increase if they prolong the loans because demand is unlikely to pick up anytime soon. It could be 10-20 years for this to reverse course! So, even if lower rates happen, it's unlikely for CRE defaults to change direction when they begin (and they will) which makes this an inevitable death spiral for regional banks.

So, how do you profit from this?

1. $KRE puts
2. $SKRE calls (or buy stock)
3. $DPST puts
4. $IAT puts

**Is it to late?**

Absolutely not. The fed hasn't even updated the latest default rates for CRE ([link](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DRCRELEXFACBS)). I have my options expiring from June to October and I've made this decision because of what we saw with NYCB which is drowning in CRE exposure which means other banks with similar holdings are likely facing the same crisis. I also work in valuations and I have access to hedge fund portfolios who are specifically invested in CRE. Their net assets compared to 12/31/22 have substantially decreased, some by 40% which is telling that this will only get worse as we move along.

Plain and simple, there's literally NOTHING that can save regional banks from a monster wave of defaults that will soon happen. If you want to speculate, this could be why JP didn't lower rates because he knows that when regionals begin to fail, he will need to stimulate the economy and if he began lowering rates now, they'd be in trouble once bad news really hit the table. The latest CPI that came out does absolutely ZERO justice for CRE either as it depends on the fed lower rates and lower rates when CPI is on the raise (especially now of all times) just isn't going to cut it.

FYI, $KRE puts, $SKRE calls and $DPST are worth PENNIES right now.

**How does CRE defaults impact the overall market?**

Just like in 2008, these banks depend on payments being made but instead of just real estate, it's CRE now and just like in 2008, these loans go into asset-backed securities which are purchased by tons of other investors/institutions. So, CRE defaults happen, regional banks fail, sell-off on asset-backed securities happen then equities/bonds to compensate for the loss.

**Tin Foil Hat**

If you want to speculate, this could be why JP *didn't lower rates.* He's even made several comments on the state CRE is in and if he knows the state regionals are heading, he will need to stimulate the economy then when they begin to fail. Thus, if he began lowering rates as projected, they'd be in trouble once bad news really hit the table in order to stimulate the economy.

&#x200B;

# TLDR

Commercial real estate is in a death spiral that will absolutely cripple regional banks and there's really only one thing out there that can save CRE which happens to be lower rates. However, there's no guarantee that lower rates will change anything since a lag exists and lower rates doesn't exactly mean increased demand CRE needs. That means there's little to nothing standing in the way of CRE defaults which will absolutely cripple many of the regional banks responsible for these loans.

With roughly $1 Trillion due in payment for 2024, you don't need insider knowledge to understand what's coming.

&#x200B;

Edit:

I suppose if some other kind of event happened that required the fed to lower rates to zero before CRE defaults happened, this may end up helping their cause but like mentioned above, even then, lower rates doesn't always translate to higher demand for CRE. Furthemore, banks responsible for managing these loans would seriously be gambling on extending loans with inflation where it's at and how the fed is responding to that.",2024-02-20,0

I was originally in with 11K shares of Spirit Airlines ($SAVE), but my covered calls got assigned.  
I decided to try my luck with LUNR and may be holding until Thursday AH, when they expect a successful moon landing.

I aped in when the intra-day price was up over 50% so it looks like my degenerate nature is back.

I still have a spare 20K if this goes to moon dust, maybe I might try my hand on FOMC tomorrow.  
Until then regards, set your reminders for 48 hours.

\- Retail, for all the yapping on WSB, is less than 20% of shares and options. Retail don't move the needle. We are along for the ride.

These legacy players at Biogen (BIIB) and Eli Lilly (LLY) promised us Alzheimer's cures, but delivered nothing but dud drugs and [SEC & DOJ probes](https://www.biospace.com/article/doj-sec-subpoenas-add-to-biogen-s-compounding-problems/). Biogen's Aduhelm was a dumpster fire so bad they dropped it faster than a hot potato, even after the FDA (questionable practices, anyone?) waved it through.

**Enter the pure-play biotechs**

While big pharma flounders like a beached whale, a scrappy biotech named Anavex (AVXL) is quietly making waves. Their drug, ANAVEX 2-73, doesn't just stop brain shrinkage, but potentially reverses it! Imagine, growing new brain cells instead of losing them to Alzheimer's. Successfully passed 2/3 Phase trials‚úÖ all while being constantly bullied by the big pharma and its lackeys..

**The Bottom Line:**

Big Pharma is stuck in the mud, their Alzheimer's cures a distant mirage. But smaller players like AVXL are rocketing towards the moon, with drugs that show actual benefits. So buckle up, grab your bananas (for potassium, duh), and don't miss the launch!

Are there any other potential non-big-pharma winners working on Alzheimer's cure?? Please share in comments!üëáüëáüëá

In addition, here is the volatility skew on NVDA for this Friday's exp. It is calls to the right, puts to the left which is the opposite of what you may be used to. I have never seen a volatility skew like this. It's not a smirk, it's a goddamn sneer. It's like it's laughing at us and just betting us to buy more calls. To say the volatility is heavily skewed to the call side would be an understatement. Some traders see this as the market is favoring an upside move, some see it as a better chance of a reversal when the market gets too lopsided like this. The IV crush on these calls will be massive post-ER. Again, take it as you choose.

Problem is, (the F1 circus) is owned by Liberty Media Group. A bunch of corporate capitalist fat cats.

They basically only earn on licensing rights and entertainment. And they believe they don't earn enough and threaten every body. ViaPlay is for example of the main streamers in Europe; and well, let‚Äôs say they overpaid a little for the ‚Äòlicensing rights to showcase the races‚Äô. The firm is basically dead, but people keep throwing ‚Äòdebt‚Äô in there. It‚Äôs all fraud and greed (i‚Äôve had emails back and forth).

Liberty Media wants Formula one to become some kind of ‚ÄòDisney Attraction‚Äô - something to never forget. Disgusting. FIA (the governing body who sets out the rules for the races are already clashing with Liberty Media).

[**https://english.elpais.com/sports/2023-01-30/fia-and-liberty-media-in-spat-over-control-of-formula-1.html**](https://english.elpais.com/sports/2023-01-30/fia-and-liberty-media-in-spat-over-control-of-formula-1.html)

Drivers have been complaining about ""formula one becoming 99% politics and 1% meritocracy racing.

Btw that kid won the F1 world tournament. Now Thrustmaster looks private, but it isn't. It's owned by Guillemot corporation (French listed stock).

Fanatec is a hidden gem under ([http://Endor.Ag](http://endor.ag/)) stock - German. 

Fanatec has a tiny market cap so I suspect the Chinese might want to take them over. Why? The sim racing market is huge and will go in the billions coming years.

Because Fanatec already has the name, sponsors, I mean, a 100m market cap stock with formula one sponsoring.

On top Liberty Media which owns all this crap does nothing else but earn on ""licensing of TV rights"". And it's not enough, although it broke the European counterpart to stream F1 completely; ViaPlay a Scandinavian streaming stock, but basically dead... To late to short that one.

[https://www.gpblog.com/en/news/244896/viaplay-is-in-financial-distress-according-to-woerts.html](https://www.gpblog.com/en/news/244896/viaplay-is-in-financial-distress-according-to-woerts.html)

Liberty Media requires more liquidity, they still own Sirius Radio. I suspect (I saw Warren Buffet a few days ago upping their stake in Sirius) and I immediately thought of Spotify (which never made a profit and should be dead).

Or that they sell it off. Buffet in his latest filing:

Sirius XM Holdings (SIRI)

*""Berkshire significantly boosted its stake in satellite radio provider Sirius XM Holdings during the fourth quarter. Berkshire now holds more than 40 million shares worth about $220.1 million at the end of 2023. Berkshire held just under 10 million shares at the end of September 2023""*

The competition comes out of China. Moza racing (Chinese race simulators); [https://mozaracing.com/about-us](https://mozaracing.com/about-us)

Are climbing up because they can offer cheaper prices. Moza as entity is secretly hidden under;

*Shenzhen Gudsen Technology Co Ltd.*

They don't have financial documentation on their website. Smells like ""state sponsoring"". Educational guesses don‚Äôt always have to be wrong. But we know the simulator business is growing massively...

https://preview.redd.it/7bmr7dihwqjc1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=044308a4e9c347ce3636095b539cbd69dde63722

[**https://www.alongtheracingline.com/sim-racing-revolution/**](https://www.alongtheracingline.com/sim-racing-revolution/)

However Thrustmaster and Fanatec are already in bed with F1, have the sponsors. Massively undervalued.

The way I see it for trading;

* small long stake in Sirius, just like buffet has done
* small long stake in Endor (as no one knows Endor but do know fanatec)
* small long stake in Guillemot corporation (thrustmaster)
* small long stake in Emerson Electric Co.
* deep otm put on Liberty Media

Initial input was around $50k, return is already >10%. I've been playing Liberty Media the whole of last year during the F1 events and doubled my returns. Listened to the investor calls and they basically want to make Formula One in some form of destruction derby. 

I am leaving ViaPlay the F1 streaming alone. On accounting fundamentals they dead already. Or will die soon. Why the long poisitions? Simulators are used by the real drivers and the fans. A simulator requires accessories. There is a ‚Äòlifecycle‚Äô‚Äô. In other words if the market expects the simulator market to grow I also expect more simulators.

[**https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/inside-story-how-red-bull-s-f1-simulator-really-works/639880/**](https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/inside-story-how-red-bull-s-f1-simulator-really-works/639880/)

In other words; *electromechanical actuators*. Thus **Emerson**.

I'm trying to capture as much of the lifecycle of this simulator. From first block to finalized in the VIP hall in an F1 track. I am running additional code on correlation between 

1) Tires - Pirelli is a listed stock

2) games - Like Electronic Arts 

This basically makes one ‚Äòwhole event‚Äô - (the growth in sim racing) - into a various wide variety of plays that all seem feasible and backed up by facts. But i've got these in place already. 

That excludes that during even F1 race I have trades in place (airlines/hotels/etc). Exuberant people enjoy paying premiums. ",2024-02-20,0

581,"The AI Bubble Might Not ""Pop"" As Much As It Could ""Deflate""",0,1avaf2f,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1avaf2f/the_ai_bubble_might_not_pop_as_much_as_it_could/,66,"In short, a bear case for the stock market occurs when it is presumed that things are synthetically valued too high, and that through natural competition, or fundamental errors of analysis, it is possible to adequately prove to shareholders or even new investors, that a stock should be corrected, cut down to a plateau of value for some foreseeable future. A bear may believe there is a way that after a company gets slashed that it could rise again, but generally that would take years to accomplish, not the minutes or days that retail options traders have come to expect. A short on a stock with a finite termination means that you aren't simply trying to ""buy the dip."" You believe that, for example, $META is not now nor would it ever be worth $1 Trillion. You may think that it's real value is 10% of that and that after shrinking 95% of its current value, it might eventually climb back up to being worth $100,000,000,000 which is still a LOT.

But what's happening now, is that options have convinced people that things are only and always going up. That this IS the way it is, and that it should be so, or that it will continue to be proven this way no matter what. For example, you place a put option on something, expecting that this downward pressure is only going to last temporarily. It doesn't work well when your time horizon continues shrinking, your bets get bigger, and the range of loss is expected to be less & less. But if enough consensus builds up that puts are going to yield some short term gain, the larger institutions who do the pay for order fulfillment may enable these to pay out temporarily, but then make users pay when they inevitably miss out on the time horizon next time, or get FOMO from the next day, or week, when calls become fashionable. They know you aren't really shorting.

In other words, puts have been transformed into bullish instruments, when they are supposed to be the opposite. It is seen as a joke whether a person should place orders for one or the other and that leaves less informed investors with nothing but confusion on what is happening and why. It leaves informed investors dejected but still playing the ""casino."" If you really believed in the bear case for a stock and your put paid out, you would probably just move on to another stock entirely to play some other bet with a new thesis. But that isn't what is happening right now.

Instead, people are just toying with the same stock, like Nvidia, on either side of the order, and the net result has been a bubble building up of epic proportions with people in this sub now almost daily attempting to ask or figure out timing of when this bubble will pop and how somebody might capitalize on it. But the same tactics are being employed, based on the same strategies, which are failing to cause a correction.

The government keeps changing the definition of things like a recession, to prevent the effect of them happening from being fully realized. It seems that a bubble ""popping"" has become something similar in that it is viewed as an impossibility. But we all know something has to ""give,"" so to speak. So try a different concept in your mind, and your money, about a ""deflation.""

If you really wanted to ask the question seriously about how or when or why the AI bubble will eventually deflate, you would need to reevaluate your thesis and be willing to take what is now being called a contrarian approach. Eventually you might be doing some of the same things but other choices will also be made, like where to eventually place whatever money you pull out instead of going back to the same old usual suspects. You aren't betting against Nvidia if this week you bet up, and next week you go down, or you can't answer questions like, ""what will earnings say and how will the stock respond?""

For starters, you would have to question the validity of the concept of AI in general. Like, is it actually philosophically possible for a machine to ""think,"" as you or I can and do think? For me, the answer is definitive: no. Machines will never actually think. They will always just compute. All debates on this occur to me like teenagers getting high for the first time thinking they are onto something deep that's actually just dumb.

You may wonder to yourself, ""why are so many people eager to 'talk' to an AI to ask questions they should talk to another person about?"" The loneliness of our society is very sad to watch. It is also horrifying how little people value human intelligence now, because AI as a financial concept demands you invalidate human intellect.

You also have to ask yourself things like, ""do I care what movie an AI would make based on nothing but a single person's text-based prompt?"" 

For me the answer there too, is decidedly: no. I am sure eventually I could be tricked into liking content entirely produced even by a self-generative AI robot if it is forced down my throat. But I am really not trying to consume such a thing. I genuinely believe most human beings are interested in art & entertainment because it connects us as people, with the universe, and we don't want or need to connect emotionally to such a machine. They will never have a soul.

Therefore, the way I value these technologies personally, and as a creative arts & entertainment professional (music, film, games) is - very little. I have enjoyed Apple's Garage Band/Logic ""AI Drummer,"" some automated graphic design things like background remover, and of course video games which have always had somewhat ""intelligent"" opponents, but other than those limited cases or the Automod who compliments me here on WSB, I am just disinterested in the AI interaction as a concept in general. It's boring.

If the purpose of this technology from an investment perspective is meant only to increase synthetic profitability or create short term gains for people already so rich as to not need them while putting me and others out of work we enjoy doing and that are valued otherwise, then I say we should just throw it all into the dumpster behind Wendy's and teach Sam Altman how things work back there for a change.

From this perspective, if you and others agreed, it should be easy to find a way to pull money out of such technologies, people promoting them, and lobby against government subsidies for the unnecessary ones. Especially since these artificially intelligent stocks are oversold.

Yes, some people will lose a lot of money, but without money in them, the technological premise will fail, by consequence.

Nobody needs Microsoft to exist for the world to keep marching on. Nor is Amazon necessary. If these companies all imploded overnight, their assets would get sold off, and services would only momentarily be interrupted. When the dust settled, things would be more competitive & fair.

That is the bear case for the AI bubble. Placing your money back where our human mouths are instead of pretending like the inevitable loss of lives and livelihoods will be worth it in the end especially since the technology isn't even close to being able to replace things in reality. What this means, too, is that the industry is full of fraud and hype men who have falsified their claims for years. That alone means it needs to be corrected.

But jockeying between puts & calls on the same 7 stocks isn't the way it's going to happen. And if we all want to avoid a foreign adversary teaching this lesson the hard way like with a 9/11 type event, or several, then you should consider looking hard at yourself, and your portfolio, in the proverbial mirror. Then invest accordingly, instead of continuing down the path of hoping for another meme-like moment.

If you don't have the time to read this but take the time to insult the length of my post, so be it. That may get you a few laughs with your golf buddies who all peaked in high school, but in the long run you would do better to read, re-read, and engage.

If you don't have the guts or cash to be a bear in this market, then the best move is to hold on and stay out of it until the value is easier to see, and competition exists in the stock markets again.

In short: dievest from what is AI-ling the market and hold your money on the sidelines or put it to use in companies that are betting on humanity.

That is how this bubble might could deflate.

I leave this all in your very capable hands.",2024-02-20,0

583,Late Night DD: Who Owns $LUNR?,66,1av96nf,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1av96nf/late_night_dd_who_owns_lunr/,70,"I meant to post this earlier, but got sidetracked by homemade sliders and beer earlier today. 

So let's have a quick look at who owns $LUNR...

The co-founders of Intuitive Machines ($LUNR) are Stephen Altemus, a NASA veteran and engineer by training, Timothy Crain, a NASA veteran engineer as well, and Kam Ghaffarian, a serial entrepreneur with NASA roots who sold his first business to KBR for over $350M almost six years ago to the day. They all co-founded the company back in 2013. 

Ghaffarian has also co-founded several other companies that are still currently operating. One company is focused on private space missions and plans to build the first private space station ‚Äì maybe I‚Äôll do a write-up on all of his ownership holdings if an acquisition of $LUNR ends up being on the horizon.

**Here‚Äôs an ‚Äú****APPROXIMATE****‚Äù breakdown of ownership of the company:**

\- Stephen Altemus, Tim Crain (CTO of $LUNR), and Kam Ghaffarian, own somewhere between **45 - 70%** of the company,

\- Citadel has around a **5%** or less stake in the company

\- The CEO of the SPAC vehicle that took them public is still invested at a **\~5%** stake

\- Other investors include Armistice Capital, UPENN, and LMR Partners

[https://whalewisdom.com/stock/ipax](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/ipax) 

It‚Äôs difficult to get a precise calculation on ownership due to financial reporting lags relative to share movement (*e.g., stock awards, ‚Äútransfers out‚Äù, etc.)* that occurred within the company over the last year, so I used a combination of publicly available holdings statistics paired w/ the most recent 13G schedules to try and derive estimates on ownership stakes but admittedly, it‚Äôs hard to do when a number of sites are reporting net changes for institutions and individuals at different time periods. 

What is clear is that the three founders are very keen on keeping control of the company in the near term and no institution owns a more than **19%** stake in the firm at present. There may be some management selling in the near-term if the stock outperforms, but a greater than **50%** combined ownership stake signals to me that they either want to hold long-term or sell big at some point in the future (*via acquisition or if the stock performs significantly well*). 

Citadel owns somewhere between **2%** and **5%** of the shares outstanding and yes, this is the notorious Citadel Hedge Fund that was embroiled with the Robinhood saga a few years back. Take what you will from that, but Ken Griffin is a respected Wall-Street veteran and industry titan. He also has his own small personal stake in the company and this does mean something despite him being a billionaire cartoon villain. 

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1844452/000110465924024113/tm245287d2\_sc13ga.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1844452/000110465924024113/tm245287d2_sc13ga.htm) 

Michael Blitzer, who has been the CEO of Inflection Point Acquisition Corp. since February 2021, remains a key shareholder (**\~5%**) after completion of its business combination with Intuitive Machines last February. 

My biggest takeaway from looking at transactions in $LUNR post their de-spac in 2023 was that there appears to only have been 3 sales since 2023 ‚Äì and they all appear to have been private sales. In over a year, the number of insiders who have sold shares is surprisingly less than 3.  

[https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/LUNR/insider-trades](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/LUNR/insider-trades) 

There you have it. **TLCR:** Founders still own a ton of shares, Citadel is invested - Ken Griffin personally, a couple of notable funds are invested including a venerable collegiate institution, and the CEO of the SPAC who brought them to market is still invested.

There will be a ton of ink spilled figuring out how accretive this could be to Capital One.  How this would allow them to better negotiate with Via and Mastercard and drop their interchange fees and thus their bottom line.

This will be the first moon landing completed by america in over 50 years and as far as I know, the first moon landing completed by a private company. The Nova-C is only a day away from being in the moon's orbit and about two days away from landing. The success in the landing will be a monumental moment for this company, but also incredibly pivotal. This will be revolutionary for the commercialization of space and the Nova-C is just the beginning. With goals of delivering payloads and eventually retrieving precious materials from space, this company clearly has a strong future. For more general information and more technical DD reference this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1atnihy/the\_value\_of\_lunr\_and\_why\_it\_could\_spike\_up\_500/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1atnihy/the_value_of_lunr_and_why_it_could_spike_up_500/)

**Will it Fail?:** I was nervous to bet on the launch because we‚Äôve seen countless failed launches, but how many failed landings have you seen? We haven't landed on the moon in awhile, but we have never failed an actual landing. Now, to be fair, we‚Äôve had failed moon missions because of technical difficulties in the spacecraft that occurred BEFORE the actual landing. Such as [Apollo 13](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/ap13acc.html#:~:text=The%20Apollo%2013%20malfunction%20was,it%20to%20lose%20oxygen%20rapidly.) or Intuitive Machines leading competitor, [Astrobotics, recent failure because of a fuel leak/Native American Curse](https://apnews.com/article/moon-landing-launch-private-nasa-0987b31b201b78c3935f1bfbf9a7cade) (more on that later). When have we ever failed a landing on the ISS? Never. Now again, I am not talking about missions being aborted before attempting touch down, I am talking about the literal moment of landing, which at this point is really all that‚Äôs left for the Nova-C. We have never failed this. (If we have someone please send me a source, most of this information was gathered in about 30 minutes.)

Is there still a chance we fail the landing? Of course. Are the chances of failing lower than ever? Yes. Our technology for trajectory and directional control in space has been stable for a long time, breaking out of the atmosphere is the hard part, the landing is straightforward. Especially for this company! They SPECIALIZE in accurate landings. Bard said this, ‚ÄúIntuitive Machines: Uses Nova-C, a single-stage lander designed for precise lunar landings and delivering payloads. They leverage existing technologies and partner with other companies for specific needs.‚Äù They're landing tech is perfected beyond belief, just look at this [inspiring animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYK5n6fcnyc).[ ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYK5n6fcnyc)

On this current mission they are set to deliver [5 NASA payloads](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=IM-1-NOVA). That means, fucking NASA, trusts this company to handle their billion dollar instruments, instead of just delivering it themselves. Apparently it's cheaper for NASA to deliver this way, but either way that is a lot of trust. THIS company will be responsible for aLL commercial payloads going forward. They will have a monopoly on delivering custom contracted research equipment and other payloads to space. Here are all the payloads the Nova-C is carrying:

&#x200B;

[Current Update: Nova-C is expected to be in the moon‚Äôs orbit by the 21st. They plan on announcing the time of the landing tomorrow, the 20th. They are currently looking to land sometime in the afternoon on February 22nd and will be live streaming the event on their website.](https://preview.redd.it/xjwy342mmmjc1.png?width=646&format=png&auto=webp&s=5efed552c58b4831c4756efec759ae2eda004954)

**The Navajo Nation recently sought to have the launch delayed because of the human remains. saying it would be a ‚Äúprofound desecration‚Äù of a celestial body revered by Native Americans. Astrobotic chief executive John Thornton said the December objections came too late but promised to try to find ‚Äúa good path forward‚Äù with the Navajo for future missions.‚Äù**

This play is for those who want to hold NVIDIA long term but are worried about a massive down swing this week. It is not a quick 10-bagger play, more to protect your investment in shares. My goals are only +100% over the next year, not +500% this week.

My positions:

[NVDA Positions](https://preview.redd.it/t466ql82lmjc1.png?width=689&format=png&auto=webp&s=27d125d593a2f260f315cb777dfb46dc15f0d77c)

The play:

* own shares in roughly blocks of 100 (don't be poor)
* sell OTM calls for this week (1 call for each 100 shares)  

   * I chose 1000 because it would represent \~37% move this week and I'd be okay with pocketing that much profit in one week if my shares were to be called away  

      * btw, that would be a $650m market cap increase, the META one from a couple weeks ago was the biggest in history at around $200m
* buy an OTM puts using the $ from the sold Calls (1 put for each call)  

   * This put serves as insurance on the shares
   * I chose a put in April to limit the IV crush, if you choose nearer dates make sure they are nearer the money
   * I chose $400 strike because that's how much risk I can tolerate in the near term

Scenarios:

* Worst case - NVIDIA gaps down after earnings but only by 5-10%.  

   * Call expires worthless (Max Profit)
   * Shares lose value
   * Put loses value or flat due to IV crush
* Best case - Gaps up 0-37%  

   * Call expires worthless (Max Profit)
   * Shares gain value
   * Put loses value (who cares it was cheap insurance)
* Mid case 1 - Gaps up more than 37%  

   * Shares are called away at 1000
   * Miss out on profit above 1000 but oh well I guess I only made $27.4k in a week
   * Put loses value (who cares it was cheap insurance)
* Mid case 2 - Gaps down +10%  

   * Call expires worthless (Max Profit)
   * Shares lose significant value but
   * Put prints. Selling it offsets the ""losses"" in the short term. I say ""losses"" because I have no plans in selling my shares

Future plays:

* If the stock goes up or stays flat. I'm buying my next Put for insurance with expiry in June/July
* If the stock goes down, I'm loading up on calls for next earning and harvesting the IV leading up to the next quarters earnings.",2024-02-19,0
602,"I'm an idiot, but shouldn't HPE be the least risky way to play NVDA earnings?",23,1av217a,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1av217a/im_an_idiot_but_shouldnt_hpe_be_the_least_risky/,60,"I've been looking at companies that are effected by this AI bubble that we're in.

Breaking it down there are the following:

Category| Tickers
---|---
Companies that benefit from selling more systems | SMCI, DELL, HPE
Companies that benefit from selling components to NVDA (DRAM, PCB, ASIC, etc) | ARM, MU
Companies that complement AI | WDC, STX, MU, INTC, AMD, QCOM
Companies that benefit from manufacturing | TSM, GFS

There's a bunch of other companies that are probably benefiting like Samsung and SK Hynix and system builders like Wiwynn or Quanta but they're not trading in the US so I'm excluding them. 

All of these companies have seen their share price run up considerably. If we start from when ChatGPT was released in November 2022 as when the ""AI Bubble"" began:

Ticker | % return
---|---
NVDA | 425%
SMCI | 1017%
AMD | 191%
INTC | 53%
MU | 45%
WDC | 52%
STX | 72%
QCOM | 30%
ARM | 101%
TSM | 105%
DELL | 115%
HPE | 4%
GFS | -6.4%

There are two major outliers in the table above, GFS and HPE. GFS isn't used by any of the above companies as a fab to my knowledge so to include them probably isn't the right move. So if we exclude them, then it's only HPE.

What does HPE do? They produce systems for enterprise (duh it's in their name). Specifically, they have products for supercomputing and AI, which according to their last earnings call had revenue of $1.1B for the quarter, and $4B for the year. Total revenue for them was $7.3B for the quarter, and $29B for the year. So a pretty small portion of their revenue, but a segment that's clearly primed for growth. 

If we look at other financials, HPE has a forward PE below 8, compare this against DELL 12.92 and SMCI 39.67 (Lol), all of which are competing in the same ""sell a server with GPUs"" space. 

Ticker | Market Cap | Revenue | PE Ratio
---|---|----|---
HPE | 19.4B | 29.14B | 7.79
DELL | 22B | 91.15B | 12.92
SMCI | 45B | 9.25B | 39.67

They also pay a dividend of 3.48% which while not great, is not bad compared to other dividend stocks. 

So this is a stock that directly benefits from selling systems as people build out their AI datacenters, appears to be extremely under valued AND pays a dividend. What's not to like? 

Then there are the following upcoming events/potential catalysts:

* Nvidia earnings is the one everyone is aware of, all they'd have to do is say HPE is a valued partner and this could be big
* HPE earnings on Feb/29 I would assume they're going to say ""AI"" at least 5 times during the earnings call. 
* GTC conference which is NVDA's conference on AI that happens on 3/17 of which HPE is one of the top sponsors: https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/sponsors/#/ (Diamond Elite babyyyy)

So someone please tell me why I'm an idiot and why I shouldn't go all in calls on HPE for the next couple months.


EDIT to add, HPE's last earnings call in December:
> Demand in our AI solutions is exploding. We saw a significant uptick in customer demand in recent quarters for accelerated computing infrastructure and services. In Q4, orders for servers that include accelerated processing units or APUs represented 32% of our total server order mix, up more than 250% from the beginning of fiscal year 2023. APUs, which includes GPU-based servers orders across our business, represented 25% of our total server order mix in fiscal year 2023. Our HPC & AI segment revenue grew 25% year-over-year in fiscal year 2023. We ended this fiscal year with the largest HPC & AI order book on record, driven by $3.6 billion in company-wide APU orders. This tops what has been an historically large order book in the third quarter, as demand accelerated for our supercomputing and AI solutions.",2024-02-19,0

TLDR:

* Overall, I'm leaning cautiously bullish but options activity on Tuesday & Wednesday will be key to watch.
* Multiple data points point bullish, delta on the order books, current gamma situation, and the history over the past week with the call OI consistently rolling up to now being at 800.
   * Even though NVDA has beat on earnings, substantially, the past two seasons it has fallen afterward. The most recent earnings had a bit of a run up leading into it. Not as much as this time but still something to keep in mind.

Past Earnings Activity: **Bearish**

https://preview.redd.it/cbieb5qu1mjc1.png?width=1628&format=png&auto=webp&s=442225e2531a9e2dc6cdb3f5906112d27a7f842b

Even though NVDA has beat on earnings, substantially, the past two seasons it has fallen afterward. The most recent earnings had a bit of a run up leading into it. Not as much as this time but still something to keep in mind.

Delta Hedging on the Order Book: **Bullish**

https://preview.redd.it/ntdu8xp22mjc1.png?width=1169&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffafe75bba9418e0e7d514df1d164d96987c6f08

One thing to note about NVDA is that it is likely one of the, if not the most, liquid stocks in the market currently. Because of that, the delta hedging by dealers as a result of option flow has less of an impact on its price than it does on other stocks, say SMCI for example. However, it's still significant and a very bullish sign. The blue is the overall delta this past Friday at 967M and the turquoise is delta on the book for next Friday at roughly 1.3B. Tuesday and Wednesday option flow will be key to watch to look for any significant change in direction or if it continues increasing. There is no sign here from option buyers that they are expecting a drop.

Gamma Position: **Bullish**

https://preview.redd.it/nk7k4epe4mjc1.png?width=1635&format=png&auto=webp&s=08e0a684a77b0a671f2acb4667e4afd329f0bce1

NVDA's current price at 726 is clearly in the positive gamma area with plenty of room. We won't flip into negative gamma until the 680 price point. This is very bullish and coincides nicely with the delta being bullish. Again, watching the order flow tomorrow and Wednesday will be key. This can change quickly.

Option OI History: **Bullish**

https://preview.redd.it/ocydo0gz4mjc1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c4e7caa351ae69b952bb5cdbed9b9997b53f166

Over the last 2 weeks, NVDA's OI has consistently been rolling up the strike chain on the call side and the put side. That is a very bullish sign. The put wall for the 20th going down to 575, I believe is just a result of Friday's OpEx, we will need to keep an eye on it and see how that put wall changes tomorrow and Wednesday.

Some other notes for earnings:

* I believe that an earnings beat is already priced into the stock. I would not expect a massive jump just due to an earnings beat unless it's a complete blowout. They've beaten earnings substantially twice before and dropped after.
* Any discussion or announcement of a stock split, stock buyback (this would be huge), strategic partnerships with other companies, etc could cause a big jump similar to META's.
* The absence of any of these announcements and just an earnings beat I believe would be bearish and cause the stock to drop.

609,Analyst Lead Time Stories For Nvidia Don't Make Sense Regarding Decreased Growth When Growth Comes from Data-Center - SORA Proves Otherwise,18,1auzg05,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1auzg05/analyst_lead_time_stories_for_nvidia_dont_make/,39,"Somehow or another UBS (The same people who upgraded Chargepoint to $7/8 per share right before it crashed) is complaining about a reduced lead times for Nvidia is somehow a bad thing.

Let's break this down.

So you're trying to convince me a company that had 11+ months of lead time working towards expanding production capacity so that the lead times are cut to 4+ months is somehow doing something wrong?

At first glance, wouldn't reduced lead times (by 50%) expect a massive increase in profits for that current quarter because you were effectively doubling your order output from a booked sales POV?

As well, why would UBS question this portion of growth when in fact 80%+ of their business is coming from their data center which has nothing to do with booked sales of their product. How are they confabulating lead times with growth when the growth is the data center.

Mark Zuckerberg/Meta and others are reporting massive purchases for product because they have the internal capacity to either USE and or RESALE work that comes from these products. The same goes for AWS, Microsoft and Google.

Another dumb thing that analyst are repeating is that once you buy these chips you won't need to buy them again.

Do you have kids that have gaming pc's? LOL. You only need to ask a gamer standing outside at 4am of BestBuy to understand that in the chip world and GPU world the next specs are EVERYTHING!

What you think you could do today with chipset A is nothing you can do next year or 2 with chipset B. Analysts not understanding this simple concept is (seeking alpha) alarming to me.

Let's go back to what Jensen said at the WGS. Compute in the past 10 years has increase by a whopping 1,000,000 time.

This was his argument for why we won't need $7 trillion going into chip fabs. However, this is him not knowing about OpenAI's SORA.

[SORA was a literal ""See I ain't fucking around"" mic drop from Sam Altman.](https://openai.com/research/video-generation-models-as-world-simulators) When I ask for $7 trillion I am not kidding around.

Let me explain this visually for you. The first video is at base compute. The second video is scaling that up by 4x and the third is when you scale up by 32x.

Let's be rock solid clear. This isn't just about video's of cute dogs.

This is about simulating worlds that AI can basically run around naked in and learn how to go from Adam and Eve to Iron Man in a period of weeks and months.

[https://openai.com/research/video-generation-models-as-world-simulators](https://openai.com/research/video-generation-models-as-world-simulators)

>**Video generation models as world simulators**  
We explore large-scale training of generative models on video data. Specifically, we train text-conditional diffusion models jointly on videos and images of variable durations, resolutions and aspect ratios. We leverage a transformer architecture that operates on spacetime patches of video and image latent codes. Our largest model, Sora, is capable of generating a minute of high fidelity video. Our results suggest that scaling video generation models is a promising path towards building general purpose simulators of the physical world.

From a technical point of view what this means is that the more and more compute you throw at these systems the more amazing god level ASI/AGI things they will be able to do. We are talking about real and true intelligence here folks.

With all of this news how do you come to the conclusion that demand is slowing? No, we are just getting started.

Let me give you another little tidbit of a wild comment (and I really like Yann Lecun) made at the same WGS conference. You can't dream up this much egg on your face within 48/72 hours.

At the timestamp (funny we're talking about video here) 17:36 [https://youtu.be/rf9jgZYAni8?si=vxoq3sH5xPaH1T76&t=1056](https://youtu.be/rf9jgZYAni8?si=vxoq3sH5xPaH1T76&t=1056)

Yann is asked what would be the ""next"" thing to get us to a higher intelligence with AI. Would it be a new algorithm and boom we've unlocked human level intelligence.

Yann replies with we need 4 things. He starts by saying, and I agree, we need to be able to train the AI like the way a baby learns going through the ""world"". See above comments for what SORA and OpenAI just did.

I love Yann, but funny enough, he didn't know about SORA and literally said we couldn't do this and that he was working on something with not great effect. And then BOOM Sora was released.

The important part, although bad timing here, is that what Yann is referring to is correct and OpenAI just did it.

Early, Yann makes another mistake that even Jensen from Nvidia made a similar mistake in the same light (and Google). We need more compute and the holy grail of AI is from world simulation building. World simulation building comes from Video and other stimuli input.

Video is that next thing. You can't imagine that (or it would be unlikely) text transformers are going to be the same as image, audio and video transformers. It's why OpenAI has Dal-E. Dal-E is generative. They (apparently only OpenAI) knows this is the start of the endgame which is thought/text/language, video, and audio ai agent multimodal capabilities.

All this with a world simulation to train the AGI/ASI human level intelligence baby.

But here's Yann just not quite getting it by stating, oddly at the same time buying billions of Nvidia GPU's, that compute requirements will become less and less. Love Yann but he's not seeing the forest through the trees.

Listen to his conversation here. BTW I really appreciate him plugging ARM here being in everything in the future.

Host: How long do you see the demand going for? Will algorithms improve it's a 2 year wait? Yann: Meta and Microsoft and the UAE is buying them all: timestamp 7:00

Yann: Chips are being designed that are more efficient. Trained models can run very easily on ARM

[https://youtu.be/rf9jgZYAni8?si=76eQ8DJej2WIRjIS&t=502](https://youtu.be/rf9jgZYAni8?si=76eQ8DJej2WIRjIS&t=502) 8:30

Yann: pretty soon you'll have neural nets running in everything including micro-controllers (Yea right about micro-controllers but I get his point) instead just think ARM ARM ARM. AI systems in every embedded device.

[https://youtu.be/rf9jgZYAni8?si=i8fWW3UqdlQTKK-l&t=600](https://youtu.be/rf9jgZYAni8?si=i8fWW3UqdlQTKK-l&t=600) 10:00

Point is Yann didn't see the video thing (SORA) coming when he was making any of these comments.

If you asked Yann the exact same question next year his answer would change. it's not going to be Neural Network accelerators but more and more compute that is in a power efficient and compact design.

Yann unfortunately sees this all ending at Open Source Software. Again, it's NOT. The worlds most powerful AI will be a national security risk and there is NO way on gods green earth that the US government is going to let a god tier AI just be downloadable on github. Who in the hell believes that? Not me.

There will be USANet before there is a powerful enough model to disrupt global markets just hitting the streets. In this way I just feel that Yann is not understanding where this is going.

Wrapping it all together. I firmly don't think people are understanding the true extent where this is all going. Chip lead times being fulfilled to me simply means Nvidia is going to report more numbers. Chip advancements simply means there will be a strain on new AI capabilities that come in the future that will need more and more compute power.

All of that will simply result down to personal devices that will need more and more compute power to operate.

It will be as if we got to start the internet boom era all over again. There will be some who wash out as frauds and there will be new players and new industries that will rise like you've never seen before.

617,Mind the GAP,11,1auvifu,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1auvifu/mind_the_gap/,21,"TLDR; Gap (GPS) reports Q4 earnings on  March 7th.  I think they‚Äôre going to fall short on expectations and guide lower on gross profit margin.  Expectations are high, but the steep discounts suggest a revenue miss.  GPS hired a high fashion guy to make changes.  I have doubts those changes will work.  It‚Äôll turn off the existing customer and Temu is making it difficult to acquire new apparel customers.

The price has run up from less than $8 last summer.  With a $1 EPS estimated for the next 12 months, the forward PE is about 20.  Ralph Lauren and Tapestry have recently reported good earnings; however it was driven by international sales.  GPS had a big Q3 that sent the stock up 50%.  Strong Gap results are priced in. 

Here‚Äôs what the stock analysts at CFRA have to say with a price target of $12, down from the current $19.75 share price.  Gap nailed the athleisure trend with Athleta, but now they‚Äôve got tough year over year comparables.

‚ÄúOur Sell opinion and price target reflect our view that GPS is in a transition period as it continues to close stores of its less profitable brands (Gap and Banana Republic) while seeing a slowdown at Athleta. We expect this transition to continue to weigh on earnings and revenues in the near term. We see potential in the company‚Äôs Athleta brand even after revenue growth deceleration in recent quarters and believe the brand is well positioned in the athleisure space. We expect continued promotional activity to plague margins and would steer clear of shares of GPS in the near term while a shakeup in leadership causes more uncertainty surrounding shares.‚Äù

Gap hired Zac Posen two weeks ago as creative director of GAP and Old Navy.  His background is in high fashion and judge on project runway.  He does not have a track record of profitably selling mass market clothes.

‚ÄúPosen isn‚Äôt the first person to come to mind in this regard. His eponymous brand, which he launched in 2002 when he was in his twenties, shuttered in 2019. The following year, the ‚ÄúZac Posen‚Äù name and IP were sold to the licensing firm Centric Brands. In 2014, Posen was appointed the creative director for womenswear at Brooks Brothers and served in that role until the company filed for bankruptcy in 2020.‚Äù

https://www.fastcompany.com/91024027/gap-inc-hires-zac-posen-as-its-new-creative-director-hes-a-surprising-pick

I suspect Posen plans to make merchandising changes.  The [clearance sections](https://www.gap.com/browse/category.do?cid=65289&nav=hamnav%3AMen%3ACategories%3ASale#pageId=0&department=75) at GAP have an extra 50% off plus another 20% with the promo code TREAT.  That‚Äôs a signal that they are dumping inventory at a loss, either because they want to rebrand, they missed their revenue estimates, or both.  It‚Äôs not just the quantity of items with a steep discount.  It‚Äôs the full assortment of sizes and colors on quality merchandise.  Part of the large recent share price increase was driven by getting inventory levels under control.  If they went into Q4 with a desirable level of inventory, why did they come out of Q4 needing to slash prices?

Old Navy is supposed to be their profit center.  The women‚Äôs [clearance section](https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/category.do?cid=96964&nav=hamnav%3AWomen%3ADeals%3AClearance#department=136) has 1990 item deeply discounted with an additional 30% off.  My theory is they missed revenue estimates and are dumping inventory to shift merchandising strategy.  They‚Äôll pull forward demand selling at a low gross profit margin to their current customer.  Then their customer will go through a period where they won‚Äôt make any full price purchases.  At the same time, they‚Äôll launch their newly designed Posen product.  The current customer liked their old product.  That‚Äôs why they were a customer.  GPS will have to acquire new customers.  

Temu and Shein are taking market share.  It‚Äôs getting harder to digitally acquire customers as the Chinese companies bid up marketing costs.  They now generate [10% of Facebook‚Äôs revenue.](https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/temu-is-spending-like-billionaire-2024-02-12/)

Positions or ban.  I‚Äôm short shares of GPS.  The puts have too high of volatility for my taste, but for the degenerates, 3/15 $18 and $19 puts have tight spreads.

I made a similar call on [Kohl‚Äôs](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/bhTXKztelq) last year when they missed EPS by $3.

625,Total Reserves of Depository Institutions,33,1auo8yp,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1auo8yp/total_reserves_of_depository_institutions/,34,"Total Reserves of Depository Institutions is a potentially very important number that very few are paying attention to, and it could be the catalyst for the next financial crisis.

https://preview.redd.it/s0e25yv2vjjc1.png?width=1314&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a6b20ad2fcf355761301422e7f061e98b64658d

This number was just 10s of billions for all of American history until 2008 when, as part of the relief efforts for the Great Financial Crisis, the Federal Reserve starting paying interest on these deposits.

The total reserves have since ballooned to 3.5T. With a current M2 Money Supply just under 21 trillion, these deposits represent 17% of the total supply of dollars that exist. In other words, nearly 1/5th of the entire supply of US dollars is currently sitting on the sidelines, not circulating.

This is ‚Äúbottled up‚Äù inflation from the GFC and COVID. It‚Äôs a ticking time bomb waiting to explode. And it could be set off by something as simple as the rate curve normalizing and the market accepting that 5% rates are here to stay.

In my opinion, this is the primary reason for The Fed continuing to tease the market with the prospect of rate cuts. As long as the yield curve is inverted, this money stays put - that is, bottled up. But as soon as private banks feel they can get a better guaranteed return elsewhere - say, in a 10 year bond - it all comes flooding into the economy, and with it comes a massive new round of inflation.

Nuclear sector companies are about to see a golden age like never before. Everybody wants to stop climate change but solar, wind, and hydro are not effective enough to do so. People are also now realizing that Nuclear is debateably the safest of all the energy sources, especially if you measure it by number of casualties per kilowatt.

I worked in the nuclear field for some time and have a very good understanding of nuclear physics, and can tell you with 100% certainty that the ""dangers"" of nuclear power are all either overblown or outdated. Modern reactors are nothing like the reactor at chernobyl. 

People may want to mention fukushima, however fukushima is an example of how safe last gen nuclear plants were. They faced an incredible fight with a massive earth quake and a tsunami that made it over the sea wall which was there to protect from tsunamis, they went through flooding equipment issues and through all of it they kept the plant and the surrounding area safe.

You may want to say that ""they had to evacuate the surrounding town and radiation levels are higher"" I'm here to tell you that its just fearmongering by the news, the approved exposure rates are so small its absurd. You are far more likely to experience the effects of radiation by going to the beach on a sunny day, or by taking a lot of flights than you are by living your entire life outside of fukushima or three mile island.

Nuclear plant workers actually experience less radiation than the average person. Smoking, taking flights, spending time in the sun, etc all increase your exposure rate significantly.



Nuclear power is the future and this is the start, we have finally left the age of ignorance. With the new gen 4 reactors, and Small modular reactors being approved we have the safest, cleanest, and most sustainable energy source at our fingertips. The US government has also actively decided to invest in nuclear power again.

Risk and fear have caused the nuclear sector stocks and etfs to suffer but this year is a big year for nuclear, westinghouse is finished with its latest gen reactor and it is set join the grid in 2nd quarter.

URA is currently kangarooing which means big money for anyone who knows that it will be ending up and the option prices are extremely cheap for how much you can make off of them. I personally believe that URA will jump probably to 30 this week at least for a bit and jump to a high of 34-35 by march 15th.

There might be a good opportunity this week. The German Government is voting on the self-growing of cannabis plants as well as a potential legalisation, in cannabis clubs for now.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-65254141

Interesting stocks in that field are Maple Leaf Green World (CA5652973069), Cannovum (DE000A37FUP2) and Synbiotic (DE000A35A59).

I don‚Äôt think that it will be a potential long investment, but rather a $smci like situation. But I am open to duscussions and maybe change my mind.

Add: Maple Leaf is already up 136% from closing

Edit: here is a more proper explanation

Should you go? If you want to put your money into a penny stock like maple leaf without even thinking about a proper dd like a true regard, go for it. German legislation on cannabis allows the cultivation of cannabis only by individuals or registered cannabis clubs. So if you‚Äôre a cultivation company there will be no chance to sell your weed in Germany. However there might be a small chance for manufacturer of lamps, fertilizer and so on. Maybe even seeds although only specific strains will be allowed.

Nobody can predict the results of this vote. But you can bet that it‚Äôs not the highest priority in Germany right now (Ukraine, rise of the far right, recession, economical decline) so I honestly doubt that this is what the gouvernment wants to spend money on.

Considering pretty much every Wall Street Analyst only makes bull cases for Nvidia, there aren‚Äôt any reputable sources I can read for the bear case.

The bull case seems clear: the rapidly growing demand for semiconductors with AI/ML-capabilities to use in Data Centers (DC). Pretty much every large tech company is buying up land for DCs, such as in Northern Virginia, and are releasing plans to buy tons of NVDA chips for their new DCs and to upgrade their old DCs. Congress is also choosing NVDA as their favorite chip-maker, forbidding them from selling premier chips to China, presumably to use NVDA for defense-related cyber operations, creating a future for significant government demand. Gen-AI was the catalyst, but machine learning and government cyberops is the demand. Concerning its price, anyone can tell you how NVDA is still cheap relative to other chip-makers by forward p/e.

So far, the posts here that warn of an ‚Äúimminent NVDA crash‚Äù are all pseudo-investing‚Ä¶ not one discusses flaws in their business strategy. The argument range from ‚Äúan unrelated tech company had a similar rise 20 years ago, and their stock fell after the Internet bubble burst,‚Äù ‚Äúit rose so quickly, so it must be overvalued,‚Äù to ‚ÄúI‚Äôve shorted it, so it just has to fall or else I‚Äôm screwed.‚Äù",2024-02-18,0

Hey, couch traders of WallStreetBets,

Hold onto your seats (and your wallets) because I've caught wind of an upcoming series set to shake the foundations of one of the biggest streaming platforms. We're talking about an epic drawn from the depths of the mining world and finance, centered on ""The Simandou Affair."" But here's the twist: George Soros, the true financial titan known for his ability to influence markets (and fuel our favorite conspiracy theories), is at the heart of this storm. No, he's not acting in the series - but he's the villain of the story that the series is about to tell.

**The Burning Question: Who Will Play Soros?**

Daniel Craig, stepping out of James Bond's shadow, takes center stage in a role that promises to be as intense as Aston Martin chases. But the real question burning on our lips is: who has the shoulders to portray Soros, the man behind the myth, the financier behind the fluctuations? Who would you see casting the Sorosian gaze over a financial empire while triggering economic crises before breakfast?

**Potential Impact on the Market**

Never underestimate the power of a good story. If ""The Simandou Affair"" captures attention as expected, expect to see waves - not only on streaming platforms but also on the markets. From mining companies to investments linked to Soros, savvy traders will have their eyes wide open to catch potential seismic movements.

**WallStreetBets, Get Ready!**

Prepare your analyses, sharpen your memes, and keep an eye on this series. It could be our next big hit - a chance to dive into the intricacies of global finance while comfortably settled on our couch. And who knows? Maybe our discussions here could even influence the casting choice for Soros. Stranger things have happened, especially here on WallStreetBets.

**Disclaimer:** As always, take this with a smile and a grain of salt. This article is for entertainment purposes and does not constitute investment advice. True wisdom is always doing your own research.

There are 3 things that can happen after NVDA earnings. Up, down, sideways.

If you buy calls and it goes down or sideways, you are fucked.

If you buy puts and it goes up or sideways, you are fucked.

If you open a PUTS CREDIT SPREAD, you ONLY get fucked if it goes down and STAYS under your shorted put's strike by expiry. Sideways, you max profit. Up, you max profit even sooner. Hell, even if it goes down a little, anything over your strike at expiry is still max profit. Can't go tits up (unless it gets bombed to 600 or something)

If you short a put around the 700 strike and are willing to go pretty wide on the spread, you can set up a trade with a roughly equal max profit and loss, each of about $2k.

Credit put spread is the move here.

I will open this spread after earnings report on a dip which is likely to happen. From there it should have no problem staying over my selected strike, probably in the 690-700 range, the rest of the week. All NVDA has to do is survive above the shorted strike for 2 days and you max profit.

Change my mind that this is the best way to play it.

EDIT: as u/sharp-direction-6894 pointed out, if for some reason NVDA tanks after I open this spread, I can simply close the short put and keep the long. The longed put will likely recoup most of the losses or even put me back in profit. This is a good safety net to have.

TLDR: Puts credit spread results:

NVDA UP: MAX PROFIT.

NVDA SIDEWAYS: MAX PROFIT.

NVDA DOWN: Cut long put keep short put, minimize loss, maybe still win if dump is huge.",2024-02-18,0

**Wayfair (W)**

Wayfair, ticker symbol: W. Please hear my thought process out.. I am making this assessment based on the following factors:

1. Growing Short interest - currently 26% of the stock is shorted. 5-6% is considered normal. 10% is considered very high. Current short term interest is 3x the amount of what is considered high, and could turn into a very lucrative short squeeze opportunity.
2. Strong revenue growth and stabilizing costs. We‚Äôll discuss this further in the DD below.
3. I like the stock - Fortune favors the bold, it‚Äôs the first ones to jump in first who reap the best tendies.

The DD‚Ä¶

**What is Wayfair:**

Wayfair is a leading e-commerce retailer in the home furnishings space - if you own a home, or furnished your apartment, chances are you purchased from Wayfair or stumbled upon their website at some point.

Wayfair Stock Price History:

5-year trading range for Wayfair has been $31 to $340, reaching their all time high post COVID due to an incredible user acquisition and revenue growth while everyone was confined to their homes and renovating home offices for WFH. The decline came in the years following the COVID boom as aggressive management growth initiatives led to increasing overhead and their hockey stick revenue growth charts began to normalize after the COVID boom.

**The Fundamentals:**

Brick and mortar retail regained a large portion of the market share that online businesses originally captured while e-commerce could continue to operate their businesses during COVID and brick and mortars had to keep their businesses closed. I believe the COVID boom on e-commerce in general pushed the growing online shopping trend forward by at least 5-years, forcing many who felt uncomfortable with shopping online to adopt out of necessity. Wayfair seems to have only lost a portion of that COVID market share, we see this with Revenue growth that significantly outpaces pre-COVID 2019 revenues by 30%.

I imagine there is far less home decorating going on tight now as interest rates have risen to cyclical highs and home buying has slowed down.

These two fundamentals describe a short term negative trend - from a peak to trough - and I believe Wayfair is currently in the trough and ripe for a correction soon.

Several analysts have reported the bottoming out of the home furnishings industry - see article from Raymond James analyst dated 2-16-2024 where the stock was upgraded to a STRONG BUY with a price target of $65 for the year ([https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/wayfair-upgraded-at-raymond-james-on-compelling-mediumterm-riskreward-432SI-3306362](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/wayfair-upgraded-at-raymond-james-on-compelling-mediumterm-riskreward-432SI-3306362)).

The fed is planning to cut interest rates this year, which will trigger the beginning of the home buying frenzy.

YOY revenue growth for Wayfair has been relatively stable in the range of +/- 5%, but still significantly surpassing PRE-COVID 2019 revenue of 9.15B with an estimated revenue target of 12.2B for 2023 if you account for the average analyst prediction for 2023 Q4 and annualize. This compares to a flat YOY 2022 in 2023, a good sign that the worst is behind us.

**The Technical Analysis:**

Wayfair broke through their 200-day MA on 1/19 and then again on 2/12. It broke through the 200-day MA again on the intra-day trade on 2/16, but closed for the day just beneath it. There is a strong channel formation with support at the $48.25 range and resistance at the $55.25 range. I will be a holder of this stock so long as it does not trade below the $48.25 support level. I believe there is a lot of upside if it breaches the $55.25 resistance level and remains above the 200-day MA.

**Important Events/Dates to look for:**

Wayfair reports revenue for the 2023 Q4 quarter on 2/22 and this is the closing quarter for the 2023 fiscal year. We are looking for revenues on par with 2022 Q4 estimated at 3.1B. Most analyst research I have read anticipate an earnings beat which would be very bullish for the stock. Their recent cost-cutting initiatives (13% global staff layoff resulting in $260M annual cost savings) will materialize in 2024 over the full year. We're looking to hear managements feedback about continuing these cost savings initiatives to return the company back to profitability over 2024 and 2025.

**Additional Fundamentals:**

Wayfair's costs have held them back as large institutional investors and investment banks look for consistent stock profitability otherwise they punish the stock. We see this in Wayfair's largely miscalculated cost increases in 2021 and 2022 to drive market share expansion, leading to a peak loss of ($1.3B) in net annual income. This figure is projected to be around ($600M) for 2023 when they report on 2/22, and it represents greater than a -50% reduction in losses YOY. Coupled with their recent layoffs and cost saving initiatives from the start of 2024, I believe Wayfair is on course to achieve the range of ($300M) to potentially even net positive income on the highly optimistic end for 2024.

Wayfair has been in growth mode following in the early footsteps of their big brother Amazon. The key differences between Wayfair and Amazon is their assortment - Wayfair dominates in the home furnishings space as Amazon has significant challenges with large furniture items in their FC's - there is a reason why Amazon does not offer prime delivery on televisions with screens larger than 55"" - they rely on their suppliers to dropship these items along with similar oversized items like furniture that are usually not offered for sale through FBA or PRIME on Amazon. Wayfair is also much better than Amazon at selling premium/luxury brands through their AllModern and Perigold sales channels. Wayfair is also exceptionally better than Amazon with their private label initiatives - with dozens or private label brands that allow them to skirt around manufacturer's minimum advertised price policies.

Wayfair has a significant tactical advantage in the Home Furnishings space niche over Amazon. They invested significantly in a 3PL fulfillment model called Castlegate, which charges their suppliers to fulfill orders from Wayfair‚Äôs own FC‚Äôs but ensures speed, quality, service, and sales ranking - similar to the Amazon FBA recipe, but for larger, bulkier home furnishings items. Wayfair has 12 or more of these facilities in the USA that they were opened over the course of the last 5 years. These are not inexpensive to operate, especially in the beginning as Wayfair focused on expanding FC coverage incurring significant costs, while adding vendors to scale the model and reach profitability. I believe the worst is behind Wayfair on this Castlegate program as they have now reached a peak number of FC‚Äôs and strong vendor adaptation - it would be wise to look at Castlegate as a competitive advantage going forward that will lead to higher revenues and drive profitability as Wayfair turns to its vendors to foot the FC bills.

Wayfair advertising - they offer a very robust top shelf advertising program that allows their vendors multiple ways to fund advertising and interact with Wayfair base end users. Again, following in the footsteps of Amazon, digital advertising and PPC models generate at least 15% of Amazon's overall revenues. This is a very high margin business because it uses technology to scale revenue growth. I have personally used and engaged with Wayfairs digital advertising program. It is very good and on par with industry standards for a niche e-commerce retailer when you compare it to the likes of Amazon. Very few competitors in this space offer a similar platform: Amazon, Overstock, and Wayfair, and Wayfair's platform is on par.

Lastly, Wayfair added to the cost cutting measures by two rounds of layoffs - once in 2022 for a 5% global workforce reduction and then again at the start of 2024 for about 13% of their global workforce. In the most recent rounds, on January 19th, Wayfair laid off 13% of its corporate workforce which will result in an estimated 260M in annual cost reductions straight to their bottom line for 2024.

I believe this recent round of layoffs will not impact revenue growth as we are seeing a shift in corporate culture across the board from a resource abundant environment to one that is more lean and mean. Their revenues in 2023 vs 2022 were unimpacted with the 5% layoff in 2022. We are seeing this type of cost cutting behavior all around us in our own places of business and/or by knowing someone who has been recently laid off from big tech.

There are several additional cost cutting levers Wayfair can pull if needed, such as reducing advertising expenses (TV ads, Google Adwords), additional rounds of layoffs, and more. Not to mention their recent switch to Vendor funded returns - meaning the vendor now foots the bill when there is something wrong with the customer's order - this is a new initiative they launched mid-2023 that will result in further savings to their bottom line.

**So here‚Äôs my bottom line‚Ä¶**

Wayfair is expected to report revenue for the 2023 Q4 quarter on February 22nd. I believe revenue will beat analyst estimates as research shows this will likely be the case (I audited dozens of websites, including Seeking Alpha, and independent analyst reports). I believe we will start to see the positive effect to Net Income from these significant cost cutting measures coupled with further benefits from scaling Castlegate and Digital Advertising programs that will be hitting their bottom line. At the very least, these subjects will be discussed on the revenue call with some additional insight and cost-cutting feedback from management that will trigger further institutional buying.

The icing on the cake is the short squeeze opportunity. With 26% of the stock being shorted, we could see exponential movements to the upside if Wayfair delivers a robust earnings call on 2/22 as anticipated and the stock approaches $60+ as short sellers scramble to purchase stock in the open market to close out their short positions.

Of course there are some risk factors - for instance, global macro economic conditions worsening, and the risk of a market correction triggered by negative earnings reports next week from the likes of behemoths like NIVIDIA, WALMART, and HOME DEPOT to name a few...

What stands out:

* We have multiple companies competing at the IP level and the Nvidia train already left the station - next stop bagholding town
* We only have one dominant producer (TSMC) and enabler (ASML)
* Alternative enablers and producers are not discounted

With competition at the IP level, the real gatekeepers are the producer (short term) and enabler (mid term). They can dictate prices, especially given the expectation pressure and demand the key IP companies have.

**TSMC is offered at a massive discount compared to the rest of the market.**

Now you will say that's because of Geopolitical risk.

Right. But what if China actually attacks Taiwan? What if TSMC must stop production?

All of the IP companies will be royally skrewed. The US momentum on AI will be severely slowed down.

So 1) every single IP company above is exposed to the same risk re/ AI - especially Nvidia, and 2) the USA is highly invested in protecting Taiwan's production capabilities.

China has economical issues. They are again trying to increase trade with the USA. They are even trying to take a peacemaker role (see MSC). Going for Taiwan would be too expensive, maybe even detrimental to their economy. IMHO the likelihood is now at a new low.

**That leaves TSMC priced at a \~50% discount.**

Fellow wendy workers, we have an opportunity to go beyond YOLO-ing again. Who's in?

I'm a German citizen and as of now do not have a broker which offers options on American stock.

What would be the advantages/disadvantages?
Are they also based on IV and Theta, or is the pricing here simpler?

Of course the next step is to sign up to a suitable broker but that's too late for the next weeks.

678,Recursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX),22,1atolq5,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1atolq5/recursion_pharmaceuticals_rxrx/,46,"Recursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX)
 

With 2023 being the year of AI, the focus has mainly been on two areas. Semiconductors and the mega cap tech companies. Sure, its rationale as NVDA is the company that is supplying the picks and shovels (GPUs) and these mega cap companies are buying the majority of chips and monetizing it now. Microsoft using Co-pilot for example.

 

The Thesis:

But this is my thesis, I think it is a fair assumption that AI will begin to benefit other sectors of the economy with efficiencies and breakthroughs. One of the biggest winners in my opinion is Biotechnology. Recursion Pharmaceuticals is using AI to speed up the drug discovery. A quote from their website states that ‚Äúby decoding biology to industrialize drug discovery. Enabling its mission is the Recursion OS, a platform built across diverse technologies that continuously expands one of the world‚Äôs largest proprietary biological and chemical datasets.‚Äù

 

Essentially, they have an operating system with a growing data set biological and chemical datasets that they use to then gain information on what drugs would be most beneficial based on certain chemical and biological compounds. Computer code is 1s and 0‚Äôs. Our human genome and DNA also has a language. To give a brief background of what genetic code is ‚ÄúGenetic code refers to the instructions contained in a gene that tell a cell how to make a specific protein. Each gene‚Äôs code uses the four nucleotide bases of DNA: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T) ‚Äî in various ways to spell out three-letter ‚Äúcodons‚Äù that specify which amino acid is needed at each position within a protein‚Äù.

The Opportunity:

This stock is up 30% in the last 5 days. An attributable factor to that is because of the release of Nvidia‚Äôs 13-f filing which shows they have a 76 million dollar investment in the company, up from 50 million which was disclosed last summer you can see the article here https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/15/nvidia-holdings-disclosure-pumps-up-shares-of-small-ai-companies.html. If you look at the other investments made by NVDA majority were actually in the medical field. Now we all know Jensen, Mr. Leather Jacket. This guy is ahead of the game, he invested heavily into GPU‚Äôs because he saw this AI future and his company has greatly benefitted from the focus they put into GPU‚Äôs as opposed to the common semiconductor companies focusing on memory and CPU‚Äôs. If you believe that was not an accident or fluke and he truly has a good sense of where things are headed, then RXRX is something I would consider. Here is a video of him speaking with recursion pharmaceuticals two weeks and highlighting how big this opportunity is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytZcvwZxkrg.

 

Financials:

The market cap is just under 3 billion and they are losing money, revenues have grown from 2 million in 2019 to 40 million in 2022. However, operating expenses are far exceeding that of revenues with 2022 having 286 million of total operating expenses.

Final Thoughts:

It does not take a genius to understand Biotech is risky and money is lost and this is understood until the breakthrough is made past phase 3 and FDA approval. But with the hype of AI, just imagine the headlines of when some sort of drug comes to market by the recursion operating system. If the stock is up over 30 % simply on the news that NVDA is an investor, consider this company using the latest NVDA technology and teaching its systems with the latest technology. I believe the opportunity here is truly incredible.

I just started a YouTube channel where I plan on specifically focusing on advancements of AI and where I think there will be opportunity apart from the obvious mega cap tech stocks and semiconductor companies. I made my first post about RXRX but there will be more to come, if you are interested and want to see my opinions on other things feel free to follow my channel.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XPzpuZewjA&t=216s",2024-02-18,0

Hello regards, after the crazy market session with SMCI loosing the $1k level , and with NVDIA ER coming to play next week, I saw lots of posts with probable moves on PLTR, TSM, SMCI and others.

Since IV is quit high for options play in SMCI and NVDIA, if the prices tanked we will not see Put or Call gains. However some regards sugested to go with QQQ, trying to capture the NVDIA movement, I did some charts and from my regardness ( I cant read candles, only YOLO charts), my points are summarized bellow:

1. TSLA:  There is a likelihood that TSLA can be rebound if the market start to sell-of NVDIA after the ER. The chart shows migration from TSLA to NVDIA in January.

2. QQQ : seems does not capture the moves of NVDIA, by the chart presented.

3. PLTR: keep the same NVDIA moviment, if one goes down the other goes too...

4.TSM: looks like after Feb/07 investors also have migrate to NVDIA. But TSM also can follow the NVDIA's patterns post ER.

5. SMCI: this crazy rocket since Jan/17 has it own move ...and the NVDIA results or moves can affect only by fear of wich were happened to SMCI (my gues, I am not an expert).

Any thoughts? Something that I missed or my ape brain could not figure out ?

Disclaymer : I have positions in MSFT and AAPL - calls and both are red :(), Put on COIN and Put on CSCO.

But I am considering buying some Calls on TSLA for DTE 03/15, Put on PLTR and TSM.

TLDR: If NVDIA hit the wall after ER, PLTR seems to follow also SMCI, however TSLA has small chance of rebound, since the migration can be reversed after NVDIA ER.",2024-02-18,0

Remember Peleton at $150, Snapchat at $80, Tesla at $400, PayPal at $300, Beyond Meat at $150, Virgin Galactic at $50, Nikola at $90... ok I'll stop.

Long term, the price of something tends to reach it's realistic value. If your business has growing revenue and profits, it will be more valuable long term. If you are pumping numbers, building hype, it's inevitable that the stock price of the business will crash. Period.

Despite this simple and plain ""quant"" rule, people often get stuck in complexity bias thinking they need some sort of nano-latency server attached to NYSE with 1000 GPUs running latest AI algorithms in order to beat the market, while most of the opportunity in the market is simple and literally staring at them.

This brings me to Abercrombie and Fitch. A company that for no reason started going to stratosphere on relatively flat revenue and net income numbers. All of you lady boys are getting wet looking at Nvidia, while a jeans reseller is literally beating your ""paradigm shift"" stock by a mile.

So what is proprietary about Abercrombie? Literally nothing, as with all other retail fashion businesses. Brand loyalty is weak, and shoppers usually go for better deals and whatever is the next thing pumped on social media.

To no surprise, ANF's numbers show that indeed, they did not invent anything new recently. Their revenue is flat to mildly up due to inflation over the years, while their profitability is inconsistent and generally flat as well.

The answer is **I don't know**. The same way I didn't know why General Motors invested into Nikola, nor why you idiots thought Richard Branson was going to go to the moon, or how no other car manufacturer in the world will start making electric cars like Tesla did.

2. FED has always said ""higher for longer"" but nobody believes them
3. PPI and other reports have hinted that persistent inflation still exists in pockets of the economy
4. The U.K. and Japan have fallen into technical recessions
5. Major layoffs in tech continue to be announced on a daily basis, and have started to spread to other sectors as companies continue to cut costs and trim fat due to constrained operating costs and reduced margins
6. Geopolitical flashpoints with the potential to expand conflicts to wider regions, and major global economic costs associated with Ukraine, Israel/Hamas/Iran/Red Sea, Taiwan
7. Seasonality weakness in February, and election year weakness is common historically, but both have yet to show face...so the timing is nigh
8. Jim Cramer just said market is strong Friday
9. Degenerate meme stocks like SMCI are finding favor and now plummeting/capitulating from max-hype levels
10. VIX and vol products are holding their levels, rather than dropping
11. Earnings in general are kinda lackluster
12. NVDA will report earnings next week and spike initially, but then drop to unchanged and sell-off in the following days, despite good growth and strong forward projections...simply due to investor over-evaluation of actual realized profits from AI. Then, sympathy selling in tech will exacerbate the selloff for the overall market /nq especially and /es
13. FED minutes this week will continue to waffle on rate projections and say ""higher for longer"" and ""data-dependent"" (go figure) because the FED is waiting on actual indications inflation is coming down to their target range before cutting rates, and it hasn't yet. This may not happen for a long time...and when the global economic crises hits, the FED will need to be able to cut rates to support growth. The FED can't cut too early, because then inflation won't be curtailed fully and they have no ammunition left if something goes wrong - but they also can't hold rates high for too long, otherwise they will stifle growth in the economy and increase chances of a recession

So how do you play anything I said above? Well don't buy options on NVDA (they are overpriced if you didn't pick them up weeks ago). Go buy some puts on tech or something expiring Friday or the following week. Anything /es /nq puts-related would also work. For you regards out there, that's SPY puts. GL, see you in tendie town.

EDIT - some folks brought up two points I left out but should probably be up here somewhere...Rent prices are fairly high/housing is expensive. Consumer debt levels are high.

DOUBLE EDIT - I think it slipped my mind but I also saw some reports last week of regional banks having potential issues...not sure how credible those reports are but it slipped my mind to include. Also, there was an unconfirmed report recently of Germany likely slipping into recession soon, if not already in one.",2024-02-17,0

Had some decent early profits on 0DTE SMCI calls, then quickly got obliterated.  Switched to puts for the rest of the day and it turned out to be the right call.  Do not own any SMCI shares or options now, but I'll be back for sure.

Price action was crazy!  Spreads were large with buys executing very close to the bid and sells executing very close to the ask, making profitability much easier.  Algos?  No idea, I'm regarded.

I started getting some consistency, which I hope continues. I was positive 10 of the last 13 trading days, 1 breakeven, and the 2 down days were mostly unrealized losses that I sold for a profit into the next day.

Most of the gains (and losses) were from scalping 0DTEs on QQQ,SPY and weeklies on TSLA,BITO,NVDA.

Full article, quick read. üëá https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/15/private-company-shoots-for-first-us-moon-landing-in-more-than-50-years

For those that can't spare 3 minutes to read, a couple of VERY important cliffnotes from the article:

- The lunar lander took off this past Wednesday for the moon in a bid to make the first United States landing since the Apollo missions more than half a century ago. If successful, it will be the first moon landing achieved by a privately owned spacecraft, (Science geeks definitely grabbed the vaseline this week),

- Only the US, Russia, China, India and Japan have EVER achieved a lunar landing; Absolutely no private business has done this ($LUNR would be 1 of 1),

- NASA is paying Intuitive Machines $118M to get its latest set of experiments to the moon (If they're successful, more $$$ and contracts will follow)

The landing is set to happen on the 22nd of February and it will be all over media outlets while Elon Musk tweets about it so he can avoid talking about $TSLA

Intuitive Machines is a company at the forefront of space exploration. The stock ($LUNR) closed below $7.50 today and the warrants are just over a $1 ($LUNRW).

773,Is Rumble (Ticker: RUM) the next big thing in free speech? Looking for honest thoughts on my analysis,0,1asgs7u,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1asgs7u/is_rumble_ticker_rum_the_next_big_thing_in_free/,38,"Could someone please review my analysis and provide feedback on its validity or at least its reasonableness?

In recent weeks, I have developed an intuition that Rumble (Ticker: RUM) will emerge as a symbol of free speech in the current election cycle. I anticipate that its stock price will surpass rational expectations and soar towards unprecedented heights. I am confident that Rumble's role as a champion of free expression will drive significant investor interest and propel its valuation to new heights. Additionally, I believe there to be legitimate fundamental and technical value in the company.


Fundamental Case:

Revenue Growth

Over the past three reporting periods (2021, 2022, TTM), Rumble has shown impressive revenue growth, averaging over 200% per year. Although expenses have also increased, the company's core identity as a video-sharing platform suggests the potential for achieving economies of scale as it continues to expand.

As a video-sharing platform, the company operates in a space where the marginal cost of delivering additional services is relatively low compared to other industries. This positions Rumble well to capitalize on economies of scale, whereby fixed costs will remain relatively constant while revenue grows exponentially. With sustained growth and increasing user engagement, the company can leverage its existing infrastructure and technology to serve a larger customer base more efficiently and cost-effectively.

As long as the company maintains its growth trajectory and strategic focus, the potential for achieving economies of scale remains promising, setting the stage for continued success in the future.

Healthy Balance Sheet

Current Ratio: 22.01. Boasts an exceptionally high current ratio, indicating its ability to comfortably meet short-term obligations with its current assets.

Debt-to-Equity Ratio: 0.42. Demonstrates a strategic reliance on debt financing while maintaining a low debt-to-equity ratio, suggesting a robust financial position with reduced financial risk.

Discounted Cash Flows

I understand the accuracy of my calculations heavily depends on the underlying assumptions made.

I employed both the exit multiple method and the Gordon growth model to determine terminal value. I also tested various growth rates, ensuring that they were conservative and consistently lower than Rumble's three-year revenue average and factored in a potential slowdown in expense growth over the upcoming years. Despite these adjustments, my valuations yielded figures that were higher than the current market price of the company.

Could there be hidden value in Rumble that the market has not yet fully recognized?


Technical Case:

‚Ä¢ The price action on the 1-year chart shows a consistent trend above both the 20-day and 50-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), indicating sustained bullish momentum.

‚Ä¢ Strong and reliable support level has been established at $7 over the last month, suggesting a robust foundation for the stock's price movement.

‚Ä¢ Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator has surged above the zero line and maintained its position over the past month, underscoring strong and persistent positive momentum in the stock's price trajectory.

‚Ä¢ Bollinger Bands on the 1-year chart reveals that the price action is showing signs of consolidation, hinting at a potential period of stabilization and horizontal movement similar to previous consolidation phases before a breakout occurs. The current price behavior suggests that the stock may trade sideways and consolidate its gains before potentially embarking on another upward trend.


Now for the fun stuff‚Ä¶


Exogenous Variables

Over the past few years, I have witnessed how stocks can sometimes defy logic and soar to unexpected heights ‚Äì and the potential for Rumble to follow suit seems undeniable. Amid a tumultuous political landscape, my bullish thesis is based on the belief that Rumble could emerge as a symbol of free speech for many individuals. Against the backdrop of heated debates surrounding censorship and the dominance of big Tech companies, this perception could draw a larger audience to the platform and lead to increased buying pressure driven by a desire to challenge the status quo.

775,Rocket Labs USA,36,1asgiye,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1asgiye/rocket_labs_usa/,77,"Rocket Lab is a private aerospace manufacturer and small satellite launch service provider that has gained attention in recent years for its innovative approach to space launch. 

Attention has been slowing down a bit and there's been some dead cat accusations, so I thought I'd do a short write up on why I'm full port. 

When I'm drunk in USVI lounging and binging star trek, I'll think of you guys. 

Short Term Bull Case: 

1. Rapid Launch Capability: Rocket Lab's Electron rocket has made a name for itself as one of the most frequent launch vehicles in the industry, with a fast and flexible launch schedule that enables it to quickly place satellites into orbit. 

2. Diverse Customer Base: Rocket Lab has established a solid customer base with a diverse range of clients from government agencies to commercial enterprises, contributing to a steady stream of launch contracts. 

3. Strong Financial Backing: The company has received significant investments from various sources, including venture capital firms and government contracts, providing the necessary financial support for its ambitious goals. 

4. Expanding Launch Facilities: Rocket Lab has been expanding its launch facilities with additional launch pads, such as Launch Complex 2 in the United States, which increases its launch capacity and geographic reach. 

5. Advanced Technology: Rocket Lab's focus on innovation and advanced technology, such as its 3D-printed Rutherford engines and Photon satellite platform, sets it apart from competitors and positions it well for future growth. 

Long Term Bull Case: 

6. Sustainable Launch Costs: Rocket Lab's commitment to reducing launch costs through mass production and efficient manufacturing processes could make it a competitive choice for small satellite launches in the long term. 

7. Space Exploration Opportunities: With the increasing interest in space exploration and satellite deployment, Rocket Lab's services may become even more valuable as new markets and opportunities emerge. 

8. Potential for Reusable Rockets: Rocket Lab has announced plans to develop a reusable version of its Electron rocket, which could further drive down launch costs and increase its competitiveness. 

9. Commitment to Sustainability: The company's focus on sustainability, including plans to mitigate space debris and utilize electric propulsion, aligns with growing societal and regulatory concerns about environmental impact. 

10. Strategic Partnerships: Rocket Lab has formed partnerships with other aerospace companies and government agencies, positioning itself to take advantage of collaborative opportunities and leverage combined resources for future missions. 

Bear Case: 

Despite its successes, Rocket Lab faces potential challenges, such as increased competition from other small satellite launch providers, technological setbacks, or unforeseen market shifts that could impact its growth trajectory. 

Rocket Lab's missions include deployments for various clients, such as commercial imaging satellites, weather observation satellites, and scientific research payloads. 

Rocket Lab's rapid launch capability, diverse customer base, advanced technology, and potential for long-term growth position it favorably in the competitive space launch industry.

Abercrombie is +299% in 1y and NVDA is up +231%.

People don't realize Abercrombie is essentially a different company than what existed in the 2000s/2010s. In 2017, they hired a new CEO who shifted the brand and product line away from the preppy-dude aesthetic to a different trend.

That trend is the resale/vintage/thrifting aesthetic ‚Äî and it's fucking booming. Do a quick search on tiktok to see what Gen Z wears these days and you'll notice they all look like they came out of a fucking Seinfeld episode. This is happening partly because fashion is cyclical but also because Gen Z is just  more environmentally-conscious, so they don't want to see a bunch of clothes end up in a landfill. If you wanna look at the macro, [there's projections that the resale market will reach $70B by 2027](https://cf-assets-tup.thredup.com/resale_report/2023/thredUP_2023_Resale_Report_FINAL.pdf).

This is why Abercrombie is doing so well ‚Äî because they shifted their entire catalogue and brand to focus on just this. Other major clothing brands couldn't because they would cannibalize their non-vintage catalogues (i.e. innovator's dilemma). Yes, recently major brands have started carrying vintage-looking clothes, but there's a difference between walking in a store and having to dig for an aesthetic vs everything being the aesthetic you want.

That's what Abercrombie took advantage of. They were positioned to do it because their brand was already in the shitter. And this is why so many young people shop there these days (seriously look it up on tiktok).

My position: Bought some ANF 6 weeks ago and I'm up 30%.

Edit: u/___fofo___ called me a big fat idiot because I didn't tell you all before. That's fair. But earnings are coming up March 6.

We're zooming out here, looking at Nvidia from a mid to long-term investment lens.  
 

It seemed to me like common knowledge that Nvidia's future valuation is way overvalued, yet it turns out many are still in the dark.  
No, betting against Nvidia doesn't mean you're anti-AI. It means you're skeptical about Nvidia's monopolistic hype in the AI space.

First, let's start with the obvious. How has the value of Nvidia, which previously generated half of its revenue from games, skyrocketed recently?

You could say it‚Äôs because of AI. But that can easily be misunderstood.  
It would be much better to say: It's because of ChatGPT.

AI-focused development started a long, long time ago. Yes, AI is the future, but your neighbor doesn't believe you because he believes that only humans can solve certain tasks.

How did the general public attitude shift towards a complete AI-Hype?  
Because a new product came onto the market with many great Breakthroughs. But it‚Äôs not just any Product. It‚Äôs a Product that is easy to understand, easy to use by everybody and FOR everybody.  
An AI Product that Businesses AND Consumers can understand.

This General public attention has made OpenAI so important, it changed from OPENAI to CLOSEDAI and is now profit oriented (look up their background story).

This general public attention has caused every other company investing in AI to release their unfinished product to market. That's how we got Bard from Google. That's how we got these Donald Trump AI images because companies didn't even bother to invest time in developing better security filters. They had to release their product NOW.

They gave a shit about errors in their product or high costs. They had to be FIRST, or at least not late to the party.

How did Meta train LLama? With NVIDIA gpus. Same as Microsoft/Openai and everybody else.

Why did they Choose NVIDIA? I wrote an analogy about this in a comment (which I'm copying into this DD). But first, consider these important facts:

\- Nvidia is a fabless company. Their stock market value is not covered by material equivalents, their capital consists of the intellectual output of their employees

\- Nearly nobody can replace/compete with TSMC (Intel is trying to)

\- Every major company that has invested in NVIDIA has announced that they are working on their own custom chips (this will also improve performance since the chip is designed FOR their specific AI development)

\- Nvidia is currently winning with a product that they sell to other companies. It's not a product that they sell to retail customers

The Analogy:

‚ÄûPrivate customers want tables and other furniture made of wood. The companies that make this furniture need an axe to cut down trees (wood).

TSMC can be described as the trees. Nvidia sells an axe that can be used to cut down trees.

The TSMC trees are a special kind of trees. They are more robust than other trees, but at the same time you have to be careful when you cut them down because they can break.

At the moment, everyone wants furniture made from these special trees because they are better than ordinary furniture, they look better and they are robust. You could say they are the future of furniture.

Nvidia currently sells an axe that was invented for similar trees, and that also seems to be the best axe on the market for the TSMC trees.

Everyone is stocking up on equipment and buying Nvidia axes. But there are 2 problems: Nvidia axes are really good for cutting down these trees, but not perfect. Also, Nvidia axes are quite expensive because they currently dominate the market.

What is happening now is that companies are developing their own axes to save money and optimize the tree cutting process.

Does this mean that Nvidia will no longer optimize its axes and lose all market share? No. Does this mean that Nvidia might be overvalued and not the only go-to company for these axes? Could this mean that they won't quadruple their profits every year? Yes.‚Äú  
   
 \----

NVIDIA made a design available at a specific time frame where companies invested heavily in gpu chips to train AIs. The Design Nvidia delivered was the best performing at the market. But it is not the best design. Training LLMs would have been better with customized chips. But designing chips takes some time, at least 1-2 years. So what did companies like Microsoft/OpenAi, Meta and Google do? Train their LLMs on Nvidia Chips.

Someone said to me that NVIDIA is future proof because designing chips is not easy and that‚Äôs their moat. This tells me that the person doesn‚Äôt know the process behind chip production. We can even look at each company involved here and get a simple, clear picture.

NVIDIA does NOT produce chips. They ‚Äûonly‚Äú design them.

Which company produces NVIDIAs Chips? It‚Äôs TSMC.  
TSMC by the way also produces Chips for AMD. And for Apple.

So there is one specific major company that produces chips for every big ‚ÄûChip Design Company‚Äú. Why are they all using this single company that could (will) be attacked by China one day and disrupt their entire supply chain? Because THAT is the really difficult ‚Äúmoat‚Äù part with AI chips. This company is the only one truly relevant for AI growth. Anyone can design chips, but only one company can make them.

There are of course small exceptions. Some companies design AND produce their own chips. And we have to look at them. Not to invest in them, but to better understand why Nvidia doesn't have future moat.

So which famous company produces their own Chips? Intel.  
Do you know why Intel lost so much market share to AMD?  
This is the reason. Because they produce their own chips. Not because of the design.

Building a chip factory is a highly complex, highly expensive matter and takes years. Intel was slower than the competition. They were stuck with the old NM production processes and couldn't get their new systems up and running fast enough.

AMD was winning market share because TSMC produces their Chips.

Intel now changed their strategy. They now let their competitor, TSMC, produce their chips so they can stay in the market. In the meantime they‚Äôre building new chip factories and want to swap to their own production again.

According to estimates, Intel will pay TSMC 14 billion US dollars over the next two years - for 3-nanometer chips.

Now, you might argue that chip design is still difficult and believe that NVIDIA will be the future for all AI chip designs - despite every major AI Company literally saying they will design their own chips?!

Ok, here is an example where a famous company used primarily Nvidia chips but stopped doing so:

‚ÄûHowever, in 2010, **Apple** made a significant decision that would alter its GPU trajectory. The company began developing its own graphics technology, resulting in the creation of the Metal framework. Metal allowed developers to access the full power of Apple‚Äôs GPUs, optimizing performance and efficiency. This move signaled a shift away from Nvidia‚Äôs GPUs, as Apple sought to establish greater control over its hardware and software integration.

Since then, Apple has predominantly relied on its in-house GPU solutions, including those integrated into its A-series chips found in iPhones and iPads. These custom-designed GPUs have showcased impressive performance and power efficiency, further solidifying Apple‚Äôs commitment to developing its own graphics technology.‚Äú ([Does Apple use Nvidia?

Here's why that's not likely to be true.

ETFs offer BTC exposure to people and COIN offers a trading platform.  Most of COIN's trading revenue likely comes from people who make orders of magnitudes more trades than the rest.  Usually relationships like these are defined by a ""power law"", with something 10% of people paying 90% of the trading fees and the lower 20% (or whatever) paying miniscule amounts because they only buy and hold.  

So... what business is the ETF taking away from COIN?  People getting exposure via and ETF are likely buy and hodlers  who won't trade until the price is either much higher or lower than their entry.  So like, 2 trades or something similarly small.  Not much revenue there.  

We should also consider that it's likely that people who buy ETF shares probably wouldn't have bought off an exchange in the first place.  So, in reality, the ETF custodianship is just COIN making money off customers who probably wouldn't have used their shit in the first place.

Also, ETFs can't do ""like kind"" trades, so if they want more Crypto they need to go in the open market and actually buy it from COIN (or someone else).   They can't do a 1 for 1 shares to bitcoin swap that would otherwise reduce the fees they're paying to maintain the NAV.  That money goes to COIN.",2024-02-16,0

RSI (Relative Strength Index):

The RSI is at approximately 73.03, which suggests that the stock is nearing overbought territory. This could indicate that there may be a potential pullback as traders might start taking profits, expecting the price to drop after an extended upward move.


MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):

The MACD line is above the signal line and both are above zero, indicating that there is still bullish momentum. However, the histogram is showing shorter bars compared to previous ones, suggesting a possible slowdown in momentum.


Volume:

The volume does not show any extraordinary spikes, which suggests there is no significant buying or selling pressure that would indicate a change in the current trend.


Stochastic Momentum Index (SMI):

The SMI is in the upper half of the range, indicating some bullish momentum. However, it is not in the extreme, which could suggest that there is still room for the upward trend to continue, albeit with caution as it approaches potential overbought levels.


Ichimoku Cloud:

The price is above the Ichimoku Cloud, which is traditionally considered a bullish signal. This indicates that the stock is in a favorable uptrend.


Bollinger Bands:

The price is hovering around the upper Bollinger Band but not breaking through it, suggesting that the stock is experiencing upward momentum. However, traders often watch for price interactions with the bands; if the price consistently touches or crosses the upper band, it may indicate an overbought condition.


Pivot Points:

The price is above the central pivot point, which can be interpreted as a bullish indicator for the trading session. If the price maintains above this level, it could suggest further bullish sentiment.


Interpretation: Given the RSI is nearing overbought levels, traders might excersice caution for potential pullback or consolidation BUT The bullish trend indicated by the MACD and the price position over the Ichimoku clouds and central pivot may still attract for today traders",2024-02-16,0

Hype, AI, low float this and that.

Here's an angle I haven't really seen discussed yet:

Currently, SMCI is a stock in the Russell 2000. With it's meteoric rise and profitable quarters, this could change.

For S&P500 (SPY) inclusion there are two very important requirements (among others):

>  A company must have a market cap above $12.7 billion.

>  A company must have positive earnings in the most recent quarter and year.

The two stocks that are potential candidates for inclusion are SMCI and ELF according to this article:

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/two-stocks-brink-joining-p-081308939.html

> Super Micro reported $640 million in net income in Fiscal 2023 and continues to deliver profitable quarters. Supermicro also fulfills the market cap requirement with a healthy margin of safety.

Like with TSLA back when that was cool and doing regarded +10% moves, SPY inclusion means all those passive funds are forced to buy into stock already going parabolic.

This could basically be smart money buying now to sell the bag to dumb passive money later. The catalyst was the last ER that made the inclusion more likely and some hedge funds figured this shit out. Look at the chart, that's when the parabolic run started and volume ramped up.

But there's also these two requirements for inclusion:

> Its shares must be highly liquid.

> At least 50% of its outstanding shares must be available for public trading.

Is SMCI fulfilling those?",2024-02-16,0

When you take a look at the options chain expiring this week, there's significant volume at $1,000, $1,100 and even $1,200 (all over 10k contracts traded today) relative to open interest. Market makers, who have to stay neutral, are forced to buy up SMCI stock to hedge their delta exposure as these options get closer to being in the money. This buying activity, especially with just one day to expiration, is partly why we're seeing the price jump‚Äîit's a classic feedback loop you get with a gamma squeeze. We also saw an acceleration in momentum during the course of the past two weeks, with 50 point gains the past two Thursdays.

However, even the gamma squeeze looks sorta broken to me. Despite SMCI's share price rising, the implied volatility (IV) for near-the-money (NTM) puts is around double that of the calls, which is the opposite of what we typically see in a gamma squeeze (this is what is referred to as skew). This suggests a market bracing for a possible sharp downturn. High IV for puts increases the cost of hedging, which might discourage new call buying and could reduce the upward momentum from the gamma squeeze. With expiration so close, the rapid time decay, or theta, is eroding the value of these options quickly, which in turn could lead to a decrease in delta-hedging activities. 

I‚Äôll be watching to see what happens tomorrow in the weekly options chains up until at least the March 15th contracts to see if positions are simply being rolled to later dates. If enough people start selling off their positions to realize gains or minimize losses, the stock might stabilize or even sharply retract, potentially breaking the already broken gamma squeeze.",2024-02-16,0

With the release of OpenAI's Sora overshadowing GOOG's Gemini upgrade, and Nvidia's market cap overtaking that of GOOG, something just struck me (maybe a bit slow):

**Web 1.0 = Professionally Generated Content** 

**Web 2.0 = User Generated Content** lower cost

**Web 3.0 = AI Generated Content** lower costs again

That's the cost of content going down the cost curve. 

Apart from hardware producers and suppliers, who stands to best gain from the content going down the cost curve?

One guess might be the content platforms with the data assets to train more generalizable models. Those relying purely on human-generated content, with limited in-house AI capabilities might be in trouble.

Another might be ecommerce companies, because of potentially lower cost of acquisition of customers - again, *if* they can get their AI act together.

Pretty impressive - shareholder letter: [https://s27.q4cdn.com/397450999/files/doc\_financials/2023/q4/Shareholder-Letter-Q4-2023.pdf](https://s27.q4cdn.com/397450999/files/doc_financials/2023/q4/Shareholder-Letter-Q4-2023.pdf)  


**Q42023 Revenues:**

  
Transactional: $529M

Subscription/Services: $375M

Corporate interest: $50M  


*Total: 954M*

**Forecast Q12024:**

Transactional - currently at $320M as of 2/13 (13+31 days = 44 days, 16+31 = 47 days left): Linear estimate = $660M

Subscription/Services: - $445M (per guidance of 410-480) 

Corporate Interest: 50M 

*Total: $1.155B*

&#x200B;

**Q42023 Expenses:**

Transactional/Sales-Marketing - 232M 

Technology/G&A - 604M 

Other: 54M 

Crypto Asset Impairment: -52M

*Total: $838M*

&#x200B;

**Q12024 Forecast:**

Transactional/Sales-Marketing -  14% net revenue \* 1.1B Estimate + 92.5M (from forecast) = $238M  
Technology/G&A - 625M (from forecast)

Other-Crypto Asset Impairment: $9.5M (average last 5 quarters)  
   
*Total: $873M*  


  
Now reinstate some numbers from above.  


2023Q4 Rev = 954M and 2023Q4 Expense = 838M for a difference of **116M of operating income**

2024Q1 Rev Forecast = $1.15B and 2024Q1 Expense Forecast = $873M for a difference of **277M of operating income**

Now, coinbase reporting **273M** of net income for **2023Q4** primarily due to **121M** benefit in the way income tax is calculated. My (very poor) understanding of this benefit that coinbase booked such a poor net income loss last year that they carried over as a benefit through a valuation allowance which was then partially released and allowed net income to go up. A corporation that loses a bunch of money one year, then makes a bunch of money the next doesn't have to pay income tax until its income exceeds its losses in prior years. And by looking there is still 1.2B of deferred tax assets on the Q42023 balance sheet.   


**For 2023Q4:**

So with that said - the **273M of net income** with 264M diluted shares gets us to **$1.04 EPs** in the press. 

That's $4.16 extrapolated linearly 4 quarters. At a current after market price of 190 - that's a p/e of 46. 

Now with the 2024Q1, let‚Äôs say 277M as noted above for net income without further valuation releases. That's $4.2 extrapolated linearly 5 quarters with a p/e future of 45. 

For a stock price of $400 at the current forecast without valuation release - we would need 89 p/e which is extremely high but not un-heard of for emerging markets highly potential profitable businesses. See tesla/nvidia/smci for how the market can operate. I don't personally believe that an industry normal 32 p/e would be valid for Coinbase type of business.  Neither do I think 100 is reasonable.


Example extremely bullish scenario:

Given the combination of anticipated bitcoin price increase in 2024/2025 due to halving in April (lets assume bitcoin reaches all time high again in 25% increase), increase over forecast in Q1 transactional and subscription service revenue (lets assume 5%), future deferred tax asset availability (lets assume 100M in Q1), and using forward looking p/e metrics in the 60 range.   


Possible Q1/Q2 2024 forecast revenue with 25% bitcoin price increase and 5% beat. 1.25\*1.05\*1.15B = $1.5B. Expenses 1B. 500M operating income. 100M tax credit. 600M net income. 2.4B yearly net income. $9.09 eps. x60 = **$540 coinbase price**

&#x200B;

Now this information is all my opinion and is not financial advice. It is highly likely I made mistakes in math and in writing this. I'm just writing out why I believe coinbase has great potential to invest in.

853,Case for JBL (Jabil),38,1arxdh5,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1arxdh5/case_for_jbl_jabil/,27,"With the insane hype around Supermicro Computers, I'd like to introduce Jabil Circuit ($JBL) as a noteworthy alternative. My expertise lies in Cloud Architecture and Datacenter Engineering, a field where I've been developing infrastructure for Fortune 500 companies for over ten years.

Public and private cloud providers rely heavily on server nodes to operate machine learning/deep learning models and AI, necessitating rapid scalability. As the demand for Datacenters escalates, leading providers such as Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Amazon Web Services (AWS) continue to expand, launching new regions to ensure redundancy and high availability. Within this environment five suppliers stand out: HPE, Dell, Supermicro, Intel, and Jabil.

It's important to note the distinction in offerings among these suppliers. While HPE and Dell are known for their comprehensive range of storage and networking solutions, Supermicro and Jabil specialize in assembling servers utilizing components from leading semiconductor manufacturers like Intel, Samsung, and NVIDIA. This specialization places a premium on efficiency and lead times, a critical factor where Jabil excels. Historically, Supermicro has struggled with extended lead times, which, as of 2022, exceeded four months for new server orders, a delay that persists but slightly improved today. In contrast, Jabil not only matches Supermicro's capabilities but also surpasses them in efficiency and cost-effectiveness. As an authorized partner for the Azure HCI stack, a credential it shares with Dell, HPE, and Supermicro - Jabil offers a insane value prop, being approximately 30% less expensive for all builds and boasting delivery times for servers that Supermicro could not fulfill, often within two months.

Jabil's strengths extend beyond its competitive pricing and swift turnaround times. The company has a super robust manufacturing network, with facilities strategically located worldwide, including Guadalajara MX, which facilitates expedited shipping to the United States. This global footprint is instrumental in Jabil's ability to dominate not only in the server market but also across various sectors, including chips, automotive, medical, optics and many more.

Take a look at the Jabil Optics: [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hodbxeli3ay)

I am getting +100 $150 Jabil calls for 3/15 at MO tomorrow, they are due to report their earnings on 3/14 before market open. Calls on Jabil went 8x last earnings.

This is the new space race. But a cure is win for everyone regardless.

[https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/putin-says-russia-is-close-creating-cancer-vaccines-2024-02-14/](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/putin-says-russia-is-close-creating-cancer-vaccines-2024-02-14/)

mRNA and genomic research hold great promise in revolutionizing cancer treatment and potentially offering a cure. One key advantage is in the personalized approach they offer. Researching a persons genetics  enables scientists to understand the genetic makeup of individual tumors, leading to a tailored treatment that targets the specific mutations driving cancer growth. By analyzing the unique genetic signatures of tumors, researchers can identify vulnerabilities and develop mRNA-based therapies that precisely instruct the immune system to recognize and destroy cancer cells.

mRNA has demonstrated remarkable versatility and safety in delivering the treatment. Unlike traditional treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation (Nuking the immune system), which can cause severe side effects due to their nonspecific targeting, mRNA vaccines and therapies have shown the ability to selectively target cancer cells while sparing healthy tissues. This targeted approach minimizes adverse effects and enhances the effectiveness of treatment, offering new hope to patients battling various forms of cancer.

I think **the true benefit** that humanity will have from AI is disease research. The significant contribution of AI lies in its ability to analyze huge amounts of data efficiently and accurately. In cancer research, AI algorithms can sift through extensive genomic data, medical records, imaging scans, and scientific literature to identify patterns, correlations, and potential treatment options that might otherwise be overlooked by human researchers. What normally would take years can now take days or weeks.

My Favorite ETF in the space is IDNA, you get a basket of very high quality companies in the space so you don't have to pick individual names.

* The stock has run up since then but I think the runup has been more than fair based on the earnings power of Nvidia's datacenter. It's not over done even though people here continue to say it is. $1000 is just scary to people regardless of the market cap.
* In the last few days there hasn't been a dramatic run up. What doe shtat tell me. Investors aren't looking to pump and dump this time. Since there's not a run up there's no reason for people to want to just dump out on great earnings. Adding to the position would now be the objective.
* A truly wait and see ""add to the news"" event if you will

**Google finally did NOT disappoint.**

The update from Google for their foundational LLM is admittedly really good here. This is the model they probably wanted to release in the first place. I don't think they can touch OAI on reasoning still but I will give them that the transformer is getting good at extracting text. But let's see.

What does this mean and why is it good for Nvidia.

The game is ON. GPT-5 is surely being trained currently or has been trained. The competition for the first time has gotten real. The AI wars are among us. Mark the date 2/15/24.

There will be a fury of investment and capital flooding into AI after today. If a nation wasn't thinking of doing something with AI they sure the hell are now.

GPT-5 I cannot wait. Let's GOooo!

Great job from OpenAI and Google today.

Keep it going.

2. **Autonomous Ambitions**: This contrast in governance models suggests a divergent path toward the adoption of autonomous vehicles. The U.S., with its regulatory labyrinth, might find itself trailing, whereas China's streamlined approach positions it at the forefront, potentially accelerating Chinese dominance in the autonomous vehicle sector through invaluable real-world data accumulation.

This transition, fraught with volatility, casts a shadow over the Chinese stock market, hinting at protracted growing pains that could extend into the Year of the Horse (2027), as growth rates recalibrate from explosive to sustainable.

**Strategic Insights**:

* **Bullish on XPEV**: In the realm of electric vehicles and autonomous technology, XPEV emerges as a beacon of innovation. This is a nod to their forward-thinking approach in a sector poised for exponential growth.
* **Bearish on FXI**: Conversely, the broader Chinese market, represented by FXI, faces headwinds. The tumultuous journey towards a service-dominated economy suggests caution.",2024-02-15,0

Listen up regards, today lord Sam 7 trillion Altman of OpenAI released an AI model to send YouTube creators out of business. (Link : https://openai.com/sora) Ok, YouTubers will soon run out of Tendies, how does this mean NVIDIA will reach 2000$ you ask?


Well to see the connection you need to understand a bit of AI. There are 2 big models that currently exist: Transformers and Diffusion. The thing about transformers is that they operate on tokens. For language a bunch of letters together form a token. ‚Äúab‚Äù can be 1 token, ‚Äúcan‚Äù another token and so on. Basically they do not think in terms of single alphabets but actually think in terms of tokens. So OpenAI took 100 million Microsoft bucks, 1 billion+ NVIDIA GPU‚Äôs and created ChatGPT that started this AI bull run. 

Then came the question how to apply this technique to images. Naively each image generates far more tokens than a thousand word essay and so understanding an image seems extremely inefficient. Transformers will not work, smooth brained critics said. Then Sam Altman pulled the infinite money Microsoft glitch and OpenAI trained a massively large transformer on an ungodly number of GPUs and showed we could perfectly understand images with GPT-4. 

‚ÄúWell ok maybe images work, but this will never work for videos, that would require an insane amount of compute‚Äù, smooth brained critics said. It turns out these critics just lacked imagination since Sam Altman proceeded to ask for 7 trillion dollars, more than the GDP of every country except US and China to throw more compute at AI. So when OpenAI says they will just brute force AI, throw trillions of compute at it and achieve AGI you better believe them. They have now come out with a transformer based Video Diffusion model. They never mentioned how big this model is, but it is probably bigger than GPT-4 . GPT-5 which is rumored to be able to understand and answer questions on video, is probably one order of magnitude bigger than GPT-4 and might cost 1 billion + to train. This means the market is still significantly underestimating the demand for NVIDIA chips and NVIDIAs price target should be 2000$ + in coming future.

TLDR; OpenAI‚Äôs foray into video using transformers shows there is far more compute they can use to generate even better AI‚Äôs. They will probably buy 10X the compute they already bought, from NVIDIA in the coming years in their quest to build AI. NVIDIA will skyrocket as a result.",2024-02-15,0

899,Understanding Ergodicity: a simple yet deeply important concept to stay solvent and succeed as a trader,1,1azywbp,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1azywbp/understanding_ergodicity_a_simple_yet_deeply/,0,"Ergodicity is a concept from mathematics that seems abstract but has profound implications for our everyday decisions, especially in finance and personal planning. Here's a breakdown to make this concept more understandable:  
**What is Ergodicity?**

* Formal Definition: Ergodicity describes the phenomenon where a point in a moving system (like a dynamical system or stochastic process) eventually visits all parts of the space it moves in, doing so in a random yet uniform manner.
* Intuitive Understanding: Think of it as the inevitability of experiencing the worst-case scenario if given enough time. For instance, in financial terms, if bankruptcy is the worst-case scenario, a system that leads to an irreversible state of bankruptcy is non-ergodic because it ends without covering all possible outcomes.

**Ergodic vs. Non-Ergodic Systems:**

* **Ergodic Example:** If outcomes are the same whether you observe a single individual's trajectory over time or multiple individuals' trajectories at a single point in time, the system is ergodic.
* **Non-Ergodic Example:** A single person flipping a coin 100 times, where a loss means losing everything, is non-ergodic. The game stops with the first loss, demonstrating that not all outcomes are explored.

**The Misinterpretation of Ergodicity in Financial Education:**

Much of financial education assumes ergodicity, overlooking the fact that human systems, due to our mortality and potential for irreversible failure (like bankruptcy), are fundamentally non-ergodic.

**Practical Examples of Non-Ergodicity:**

* **Margin Calls:** Selling a naked call that goes south before it can potentially profit is a classic example of non-ergodic financial peril.
* **Defaulting on a home loan:** another example of disastrous non-ergodicity is being on a mortgage and then losing a job and missing mortgage payments but if you had 2 months more time you would've found a new job and resumed the payments. However, because you missed the mortgage payments, you default on the home loan now. In this system if your finances were more ergodic you would've been able to financially bridge the 2 months gap and you won't hit the termination point of defaulting on the home loan.

**How to Increase Ergodicity in Your Life:**

* **The Barbell Strategy:** Combining extreme risk aversion (like a stable job) with high-risk pursuits (like entrepreneurship or acting) can create a more ergodic life strategy.
* **The Kelly Criterion:** This principle suggests never betting everything, increasing bets when winning, and decreasing them when losing, to bring more predictability into inherently unpredictable situations.

**Key Takeaway:**  
Understanding ergodicity and how to apply strategies like the Barbell or Kelly Criterion can significantly improve decision-making, particularly in finance and life planning. It's about recognizing the non-ergodic nature of life and strategically planning to cover as many beneficial outcomes as possible over time.",2024-02-25,0

The public sector will be slower to incorporate AI and that‚Äôs where the jobs will really be available in the future.

903,Nvidia (NVDA) Investment Analysis,0,1azpze3,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1azpze3/nvidia_nvda_investment_analysis/,25,"# Introduction:

NVDA has had a meteoric rise over the past 5 years, rising almost 2000% in price. This rise was catalyzed by 2 events that demonstrated the power of NVDA. The first is the rise in cryptocurrency and more recently the boom in Generative AI. 

NVDA is a fabless chipmaker, which means that they are responsible for designing the chips but the production of the chips is outsourced to a foundry e.g. TSMC and then the product is sold to another company e.g. ASUS, attached to a system, and finally sold as the GPU that consumers use.

I don't think doing a granular DCF/Comps Valuation would serve to accurately value the company given how a DCF would lack sufficient accurate public data to create a reliable revenue model and a comps valuation would significantly undervalue NVDA given how 1) There are only 2 pure play fabless chip designer namely NVDA and AMD. 2) NVDA is operating in essentially a monopoly market so any form of comps valuation regresing it to even 75th percentile would severely undervalue it.

So, I will be laying out all the information for NVDA including their history and my investment thesis for NVDA followed by a DCF model that may not be very granular but provides a brief overview of what results NVDA needs to produce over the next 10 years for it to be worth $788 per share as valued by the market on Feb 2024.

# Background:

NVDA started out producing GPUs for gaming, but their founder decided in 2006 to start investing in AI. This started in the form of the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) platform, where certain languages like C++ could only be ran on the CPU so CUDA allowed the code to be ran on the GPU which helped speed up the process significantly.

NVDA had a quick surge in stock prices when cryptocurrency prices rose back in 2018. This is because miners were eager to get their hands on high-end GPUs, these GPUs produced by NVDA were perfect for cryptomining. This drove up demand for NVDA's GPUs and boosted their topline. However, this rally was short-lived once cryptocurrencies began crashing.

In 2022, OpenAI released ChatGPT which helped skyrocket interest in AI as everyday consumers were now able to see the tangible benefits of AI and its large capabilities. OpenAI was trained using NVDA's processors as NVDA's products were the best the industry had to offer.

More and more companies started developing an interest in AI specifically Large Language Model (LLM). These LLMs require large chunks of data to be processed and so it led to the rise in demand for NVDA's processors. As more companies want to develop AI capabilities, they require NVDA's processors to be able to build their AI which boosted demand for NVDA's processors, so much so that there was a shortage of processors like the H100.

# Competitors:

NVDA has developed the H100 GPU specialized to handle power-intensive AI training. In response companies like GOOG, AMZN ,and MSFT have attempted to create their own chips to compete with NVDA.

GOOG has developed their Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) which they used to train their own LLM AI, previously named Bard now Gemini.

AMZN has developed Trianium2 which is expected to be on par in terms of sheer performance with NVDA's latest innovation in the pipeline, H200.

MSFT has Co-Operated with OpenAI to develop Maia in a bid to try and replace NVDA's chips.

# Investment Thesis:

  
***Strong First Mover Advantage***  
When generative AI had a large boom, it exacerbated the need for a specialized chip to handle AI-related workloads. However, none of the other chip companies had invested as heavily in specialized chips as NVDA. NVDA had spent the past decade fine-tuning their chips to be more suited for AI, where they had built a system around AI from software(CUDA) to hardware. Offering a highly effective solution that covers all AI needs that competitors are unable to offer.

***Large Switching Cost***  
Given how well NVDA's products work, most AI-related work is done using NVDA's products. This allows NVDA to tailor future products to be more suited according to feedback given on the AI-related work done using NVDA. ‚ÄúMost software systems used to train A.I. technologies were tailored to work with Nvidia‚Äôs chips.‚Äù. ([SOURCE)](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/29/technology/ai-chips-nvidia-amazon-google-microsoft-meta.html) E.g. MSFT had to invest $13 Billion into OpenAI and Co-develop Maia, a chip tailored towards AI. For OpenAI to swap from NVDA chips to MSFT. So, it would take a substantial reinvestment in new hardware and software to replace NVDA.

***Significantly Better Margins & Turnover***  
AMD which is NVDA‚Äôs closest competitor has an operating margin of 1.77% compared to NVDA‚Äôs 54.12%. This large difference in margins is attributable to how well NVDA‚Äôs supply chain is set up for them to capitalize on very large economies of scale. On top of that, this shows NVDA‚Äôs strong ability to command such a high premium and still have the majority of the market willing to pay these premiums. This speaks volumes of the quality and reputation of NVDA which is miles ahead of their competitors. On top of that, NVDA has a Day inventory of 32 compared to AMD‚Äôs 70 this means that NVDA can turnover inventory every 32 days compared to AMD at more than double that rate, displaying just how efficient NVDA‚Äôs inventory management is compared to AMD.

# Conclusion:

I believe that the potential of NVDA is limitless, to draw an analogy in a baseball match the real winner is the one that sells the ticket to the match. NVDA may not be able to predict precisely which aspect of AI will take off but it provides the engine necessary to reach there. Given the large headstart and large ecosystem around AI that NVDA has built, it is on a strong footing. NVDA operates in a monopolistic manner due to how unique their products are and in this aspect it has a strong competitive advantage.

Analysts write articles everywhere! Popping on news feeds etc.

Given how they are discussed frequently online, I decided to take a look. Each company is taking advantage of the AI trend. PLTR using AI in their software for counter-terrorism investigations and SHOP using AI to further develop websites for individuals who wish to build an online store for marketing their product. 

Each company enjoyed a surge in 2021's pandemic / stock frenzy time but has since declined after stock correction in 2022. Both are now under pressure by investors' expectations from the AI trend's test of practicality. Seems clearcut and reasonable for the hype?

From a technical perspective, both stocks stink. A negative EPS with P/E Ratio of over 200 happening quite often. Recently, PTLR's EPS hits a positive of 0.09 and SHOP's EPS a 0.07, not impressive at the least. Their P/E Ratio is most telling with a 260 and 1011 respectively.

Yup, you are reading that correctly, a P/E ratio of over 1000... I haven't been investing for over 10 years but it is my first time seeing a 4 figure P/E ratio. 

TLDR: My conclusion? Confusion. I don't understand where the hype is and how it is justified based on the technicalities of both companies. Their finances stink and their AI potential seems more of a joining the bandwagon maneuver. 

Yet, they are so popular! PLTR has over a 50B market cap and SHOP has over 200B market cap, which put them in a large cap! What is going on? What is everyone's thoughts on this?",2024-02-25,0

The only apparent overvaluation looks in the electronic technology sector, but we all know the reason (AI/GPU wave).

Interesting enough, consumer durables overvaluation is due to TSLA alone.

>Charlie Munger died on November 28, just 33 days before his 100th birthday.

>Though born and raised in Omaha, he spent 80% of his life domiciled elsewhere. Consequently, it was not until 1959 when he was 35 that I first met him.

>In 1962, he decided that he should take up money management.

>Three years later he told me ‚Äì correctly! ‚Äì that I had made a dumb decision in buying control of Berkshire. **But**, he assured me, since I had already made the move, he would tell me how to correct my mistake.

>In what I next relate, bear in mind that Charlie and his family did not have a dime invested in the small investing partnership that I was then managing and whose money I had used for the Berkshire purchase. Moreover, neither of us expected that Charlie would ever own a share of Berkshire stock.

>Nevertheless, Charlie, in 1965, promptly advised me: ‚ÄúWarren, forget about ever buying another company like Berkshire. But now that you control Berkshire, add to it wonderful businesses purchased at fair prices and give up buying fair businesses at wonderful prices. In other words, abandon everything you learned from your hero, Ben Graham. It works but only when practiced at small scale.‚Äù With much back-sliding I subsequently followed his instructions.

>Many years later, Charlie became my partner in running Berkshire and, repeatedly, jerked me back to sanity when my old habits surfaced. Until his death, he continued in this role and together we, along with those who early on invested with us, ended up far better off than Charlie and I had ever dreamed possible.

>In reality, Charlie was the ‚Äúarchitect‚Äù of the present Berkshire, ad I acted as the ‚Äúgeneral contractor‚Äù to carry out the day-by-day construction of his vision.

>Charlie never sought to take credit for his role as creator but instead let me take the bows and receive the accolades. In a way his relationship with me was part older brother, part loving father. Even when he knew he was right, he gave me the reins, and when I blundered he never ‚Äì **never** ‚Äìreminded me of my mistake.

>In the physical world, great buildings are linked to their architect while those who had poured the concrete or installed the windows are soon forgotten. Berkshire has become a great company. 

>Though I have long been in charge of the construction

919,Is the US Heading Towards a Soft Landing?,0,1aypzo4,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1aypzo4/is_the_us_heading_towards_a_soft_landing/,35,"One of the key debates around the health of the US economy is whether a soft landing is in sight. After avoiding a recession and with markets ending on a high note in 2023, the US Congressional Budget Office declared in December that ‚Äú[b]y many measures, the economy looks like it is headed for a soft landing.‚Äù
Likewise, Goldman Sachs Wealth Management Investment Strategy Group (ISG) is expecting a soft landing this year. However, recession risks remain above average. Here‚Äôs why.
Recession risk is lower compared to last year but uncertainty persists
ISG‚Äôs recession probability is 30% over the next 12 months, which is still somewhat elevated due to persistent uncertainty around still-inverted yield curves (a signal that the market as a whole is becoming more pessimistic about the economic prospects for the near future); the lagged impact of past monetary tightening; and potential pandemic distortions that may compromise previously reliable recession signals.
Despite the risks, ISG expects GDP to grow at a trend-like pace of 2.1% in 2024, supported by three factors:
A robust household sector (considering consumer spending accounts for nearly 70% of US GDP)
Stable investment
Gradually easing financial conditions (a benchmark of forces that impact the economy)
Our ISG colleagues believe consumer consumption will grow at around 2% this year, likely to be driven by rising real incomes.
ISG sees an optimistic economic scenario for 2024, but is that enough for a soft landing? To answer that, it may be helpful to first understand when economists would truly call a recession.
When is a recession, truly a recession?
The typical textbook definition of a recession is when real GDP declines over two consecutive quarters. It is a method maintained by some economists, but the official process to call a true recession is more complicated and requires a holistic analysis of economic activity.
The National Bureau of Economic Research‚Äôs (NBER) Business Cycle Dating Committee is the official scorekeeper of recession. The Committee defines a recession as ‚Äúa significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in production, employment, real income, and other indicators. A recession begins when the economy reaches a peak of activity and ends when the economy reaches its trough.‚Äù
The NBER Committee not only considers GDP data before deciding to call a recession, but they also analyze trends in economic activity including employment, income, sales, and industrial production.
Another widely cited indicator is the ‚ÄúSahm rule‚Äù, named after economist Claudia Sahm. It states a recession is likely underway if the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate rises by at least 0.5% ‚Äì or 50 basis points ‚Äì relative to its lowest point in the previous 12 months. As of January, the indicator stands at 0.2% ‚Äî which improved versus the December reading ‚Äî meaning there is no current indication of recession based on this metric.
Is US heading towards a soft landing?
Defining a ‚Äúsoft landing‚Äù isn‚Äôt straightforward either, but an economist at the St Louis Federal Reserve offered the following explanation: ‚ÄúA soft landing is when [the Fed] increase[s] interest rates and manage[s] to decrease inflation, but without causing unemployment to go up drastically and GDP growth to go negative.‚Äù
Conversely, a hard landing would occur if the Fed increased interest rates which led to a decrease in inflation but at the cost of a recession and high unemployment.
The Fed‚Äôs rate hike campaign to date has managed to lower the inflation rate. ISG expects inflation to continue its downward trend and average around 2.5% this year. ISG also anticipates four 25-basis-point Federal Reserve rate cuts this year, but following the January FOMC commentary, they have pushed back their expectation for the first rate cut to May (from March previously).
Wages are currently growing at a rate above the Fed‚Äôs comfort level, but the labor market has made substantial progress towards rebalancing with job openings and quit rates approaching pre-pandemic levels, without a significant rise in the unemployment rate.
ISG expects these rebalancing dynamics to continue through 2024, predicting a modest increase in the unemployment rate from 3.7% to 4.1%.
Considering all factors, ISG sees a runway for a soft landing but cautions that seatbelts should remain fastened until we reach the gate.

*KEY POINTS*

* *Global markets have hit record highs as the frenzy around artificial intelligence boosted risk sentiment, but some investors have urged caution.*
* *Oliver B√§te, CEO of wealth manager Allianz, which has around $1.85 trillion in assets under management, said it looks ‚Äúvery dangerous out there.‚Äù*
* *European markets moved higher Friday, extending positive momentum from Thursday‚Äôs session, when the Stoxx 600, Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nikkei all notched record highs.*

&#x200B;

*Global markets hit record highs this week as the frenzy around artificial intelligence boosted risk sentiment and hopes of a return to economic growth. But some investors have urged caution, suggesting that high tech valuations could put the rally at risk.*

*Oliver B√§te, CEO of wealth manager Allianz, which has around $1.85 trillion in assets under management, said it looks ‚Äúvery dangerous out there.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúWe are very cautious about some of the valuations in the tech sector,‚Äù he told CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúSquawk Box Europe‚Äù on Friday.*

*European markets extended gains Friday after the Stoxx 600 index closed at an all-time high in the previous session.*

*Fresh earnings out of Europe and spillover from Nvidia‚Äôs bumper revenue report in the U.S. helped push the pan-European benchmark to 495.1 on Thursday ‚Äî surpassing its previous record of 494.35 in January 2022, according to data from LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv. Germany‚Äôs DAX and the French CAC also hit record highs.*

*In Asia-Pacific, Japan‚Äôs Nikkei 225 closed at a new all-time high of 39,098.68 on Thursday, surpassing the previous record of 38,915.87 set in 1989.*

*The gains have been mirrored stateside, with U.S. stock indexes also scaling fresh all-time highs.*

*It comes amid ever-growing hype around AI innovation and the anticipated boost it could bring to the sluggish global economy.*

*Shares of Nvidia closed up 16% on Thursday after its full-year results showed revenue jumped 265% on the back of soaring demand for its AI chips. The surge boosted Nvidia‚Äôs market cap by $276 billion ‚Äî the biggest one-day gain for any company on record.*

*Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters told CNBC on Friday that the recent rallies pointed to AI ‚Äúinnovation in action on every front,‚Äù and said his company had benefited ‚Äúenormously‚Äù from the tech. The comments came shortly after the bank posted an 18% increase in pretax profit and announced a $1 billion share buyback program in its full-year earnings Friday.*

*However, Philippe Ferreira, deputy head of economics and cross-asset strategy at Kepler Cheuvreux, raised questions about how long the AI hype will continue to drive markets higher.*

*‚ÄúOver the course of the year, it is likely that the overall AI theme will get a reality check at the companies‚Äô level,‚Äù he said in notes to CNBC earlier this week. ‚ÄúThe AI trade as we have seen it might have a little more to go, but it seems to be approaching important technical levels where some profit taking could occur.‚Äù*

*In the U.S. this week, investors piled into growth and technology stocks pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 higher. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite also recorded its best session since February 2023, popping 2.96% to close at 16,041 on Thursday.*

*For Ferreira, ‚Äú18,300 on NDX and early March could be key exit levels ahead of some material consolidation.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúThere is no shortage of fundamental catalysts and important reckonings could be up ahead,‚Äù he added.*

*For Allianz‚Äô B√§te, there remain still-present pockets of risk in tech and beyond. ‚ÄúIf I was individually investing \[in tech\], great idea. As an institutional investor, you need to be a bit careful,‚Äù he warned.*

*‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of risk in investment markets, there‚Äôs a lot of questions about credit markets, there‚Äôs a lot of questions about real estate,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very dangerous out there.‚Äù*

*On Japan‚Äôs headline-making rally, Aoifinn Devitt, chief investment officer at investment advisory group Moneta, also expressed some concerns. She said the recent move higher appeared to have diverted attention away from market fundamentals.*

925,Block shares surge after company announces surprise profit,362,1ay60ju,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ay60ju/block_shares_surge_after_company_announces/,81,"Block stock rose 20% in Friday morning trading after the payments company reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat analyst estimates on gross profit and showed strong growth in its Square and Cash App revenue.

Here‚Äôs how the company did, compared to an analyst consensus from LSEG, formerly Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: 45 cents, adjusted. Not comparable to estimates.

Revenue: $5.77 billion vs. $5.70 billion expected

Block posted $2.03 billion in gross profit, up 22% from a year ago. Analysts tend to focus on gross profit as a more accurate measurement of the company‚Äôs core transactional businesses.

The company raised its adjusted EBITDA forecast to at least $2.63 billion from $2.40 billion.

Block, formerly known as Square, ended the year with 56 million monthly transacting actives for Cash App in December, with most of those customers using it for either peer-to-peer payments or the Cash App Card.

Its Cash App business reported $1.18 billion in gross profit, a 25% year-over-year rise.

The company, which is run by Jack Dorsey, said its Cash App Card has 23 million monthly actives in December, up 20%. That is more than two times the growth rate of total monthly actives.

‚ÄúWe believe this strategy will enable us to build the largest network in the long run, with a highly engaged customer base using Cash App as their primary banking solution,‚Äù Dorsey said in a note to shareholders.

The payments firm has focused on slimming down operations in recent months. In January, the Block CEO reportedly said in a note to staffers that the company had laid off a ‚Äúlarge number‚Äù of workers. This followed another round of layoffs in December.

Dorsey said in his note to shareholders that the company was now below a previously set cap of 12,000 employees.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to operate under this cap until we feel it‚Äôs holding us back, which is likely years out,‚Äù Dorsey wrote. The company recorded a $70 million charge for severance costs.

The company also took an $132 million impairment on its investment in music streaming service Tidal. Block and Dorsey have had a mixed dealmaking record. The company sold delivery service Caviar to DoorDash in 2019 in a $410 million cash-and-stock deal. It also acquired Afterpay in 2021 for $29 billion, its largest acquisition ever.

Afterpay has struggled since the deal announcement, posting successive quarters of losses throughout 2022. Dorsey said in his note to shareholders that integrating Afterpay more tightly into Cash App and using it to power Cash App‚Äôs buy-now, pay-later technology were two focuses for 2024.

Block‚Äôs strong quarterly results and full-year outlook prompted Wall Street analysts to upgrade their rating of the stock on Friday.

Wells Fargo upgraded Block to overweight and raised its price target from $65 to $95, while Seaport Research Partners upgraded the stock to a buy and also hiked its price target to $95.

‚ÄúSQ‚Äôs progress over the past several months in terms of streamlining itself organizationally, sharpening its focus within its two key businesses Square and Cash App, and becoming hyper-focused on driving profitable growth has been impressive,‚Äù the Seaport Research Partners analysts wrote. ‚ÄúWe think there‚Äôs more to go.‚Äù

The British lender on Thursday posted pretax profit for the three months to Dec. 31 of GBP1.775 billion pounds compared with GBP1.06 billion for the same period a year earlier and with GBP1.65 billion expected by a company-compiled consensus.

The FTSE 100 listed bank's net income fell to GBP4.23 billion from GBP4.69 billion for the year-earlier period, missing consensus' GBP4.43 billion estimate. Net interest income made up GBP3.32 billion of the total, against expectations of GBP3.37 billion.

Its net interest margin--the difference between what it earns on loans and pay out on deposits--for the quarter was 2.98%, against expectations of 3.01%. For 2024, it guided for margin above 2.90%--while analysts pencil in 2.96% for the year--as the benefits from higher interest rates which boosted its top line over 2023 start to taper off.

It also sees heavier-than-expected costs for the year ahead as it guided for around GBP9.3 billion in operating expenses, up from its previous view of around GBP9.2 billion and reported GBP9.14 billion in 2023.

Lloyds Banking said that it booked a GBP450 million provision in its quarterly results for the potential impact of the Financial Conduct Authority's review into historical discretionary commission arrangements in the motor finance industry, to which the bank is exposed to through its Black Horse brand.

The board declared a final dividend of 1.84 pence, bringing the full-year payout to 2.76 pence.

Does anyone have a good sense of the breakeven levels? Using Petrobas (PBR) as a reference point i infer that it could be sub $35-$40/bl level, but not confident with my analysis.

And since it's lighter crude, easier on the refinery operators to process. Would be more logical that XOM is selling the production at a PREMIUM over certain WTI or BRENT oil benchmark.

Following ExxonMobil‚Äôs commercial discovery at the giant Liza field in the Stabroek Block offshore Guyana in 2015, it was confirmed that the oil found is of ‚Äòhigh quality‚Äô. The term ‚ÄúHigh Quality‚Äù is commonly used to refer to crude oil which is sweet (low sulphur content) and light (high API gravity).  This means oil which has been determined to rank higher on the American Petroleum Institute (API) Gravity Scale and determined to be of a low sulphur content.  
**This bodes well for Guyana as sweet light crude is the preferred type from which the highest value petroleum products are derived.** However, it is important to note that the price of Guyana‚Äôs crude will be dependent on more than just its quality. More on this later.

# Introduction:

YUM! Brands is one of the most iconic companies in the F&B industry, holding the most globally iconic fast food brands from KFC to Pizza Hut. However, having so many strong household names is a double-edged sword for the company. There is a large amount of effort and capital demands necessary to elevate the brands to their highest potential. YUM seems to be conflicted about which brands are they going to focus their attention on and which brands are going to coast by. With a generally negative sentiment surrounding their brands such as the falling quality of these brands overtime, major franchisees failing and competing not based on value but price.  

# Revenue:

KFC or any other YUM brands are unlikely able to keep their franchisees in line with very stringent QC as they could face pushback. YUM brands should‚Äôve established strong QC from the start, taking a leaf out of MCD‚Äôs books.  
  
Pizza Hut is losing out to Dominos because Dominos was an early investor in tech which they capitalized on during the pandemic and it led to Dominos being able to steal market shares. Dominos also uses a tactic called ‚Äúfortressing‚Äù where they add stores in established markets to be as near to consumers as possible, making delivery easier too.  
  
KFC‚Äôs main growth comes from outside of the US where it is perceived as a ‚Äúhigh quality‚Äù food product as it came from the West. This is especially true in Asian countries where Western brands are highly regarded. KFC's main expansion plan seems to be along South East Asia or East Asia given their recent large expansion in Thailand and India.  
  
Taco Bell is mainly in the US, so comparing Taco Bell to its closest competitor Chipotle. The main difference between the two is that Taco Bell is almost entirely franchised whereas Chipotle is the opposite. Given that both brands are competing based on providing the most value meal for consumers in terms of pricing and product offerings. I believe over time the strong franchising would provide strong economies of scale for Taco Bell to capitalize on, on top of that with the technology innovation done by YUM, it could be integrated into Taco Bell for even more cost savings allowing Taco Bell to compete better than Chipotle.  
  
When forecasting Total Stores, I believe that historically the number of stores opened was depressed due to the Ukraine War and on top of that the tight interest rate environment. So, as negative sentiments of the war loosens and the interest rate environment improves it will lead to more stores being opened. Better branding from the YUM brand as a whole through marketing and technological innovations such as Recommended Ordering makes being an operator for YUM more appealing. I assumed it took about 4 years for interest rates to be lifted and investor's sentiments to improve. As YUM gets a foothold in more countries and their brand‚Äôs power is being proven to more investors it leads to an acceleration in the number of stores opening before tapering downwards.  
  
When forecasting %Franchised, I assume that YUM's ultimate goal is to reach 98% franchised.  
  
When forecasting System sales, as more stores are opened it translates into more system sales. A combination of factors such as increased accessibility, more brand recognition, and stronger customer loyalty means that there is an acceleration in growth rate. However, I‚Äôm cautious about how fast this growth will be as Taco Bell once failed in Mexico because even though Taco Bell is considered ‚Äúcheap‚Äù in the US, in Mexico there are other cheaper food alternatives. So, this logic applies to most developing Asian countries.  
  
When forecasting Revenue/Company Store, as historic revenue/company store earned is depressed due to the Ukraine war I assumed that over time it will recover. I believe that Revenue/Company store is matured and unlikely to fluctuate wildly. Accounting for the growing number of franchisees, it will translate into a larger cannibalistic effect on revenue. I assumed that revenue would not grow back to pre-COVID levels at a fast pace and Revenue/Company Store would grow due to larger ticket size as a result of inflation.  
  
When forecasting for YUM's latest addition Habit Burger Grill, as it is a new brand with only 18% franchised the future of Habit Burger Grill is very volatile and could lead to inaccurate forecast if I applied too granular of a model for it. So, I forecasted Habit Burger Grill as a %Y/Y growth.  


# Cost:

Ultimately at base case, I value YUM at $99.80 per share. The stock is overvalued due to the goodwill that the company has built previously. However,  if status quo was to be maintained going forward I believe that the reality of subpar QC in YUM and the splitting of attention between the multiple brands owned by YUM would lead to their stock prices reconciling back to its real value.s to roll this out to all KFC stores by the end of 2023.  
  
In-store kiosks are good because ‚ÄúKiosks not only drive a higher check compared to our traditional front counter but also drive higher margins through operational efficiencies and generate new opportunities to leverage customer data and create personalized ordering experiences.‚Äù - 2023 Q3 Earnings Conference.  
‚ÄúWe now have kiosks in nearly 40% of KFC stores outside of China‚Äù - 2023 Q3 Earnings Conference.  
  
When forecasting Company Restaurant Expenses, given that over time less of the company‚Äôs revenue will be generated through the direct operation of restaurants I assumed that Company Restaurant Expenses tended downwards.  
  
When forecasting SG&A, given the new technology that YUM plans to implement e.g. Recommended Ordering and In-Store kiosks, it would cut the headcount necessary to operate stores. I assumed that SG&A tended downwards.  
  
When forecasting Franchise Advertising and Others, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

The bank reported 2023 statutory pre-tax profit rose to $5.09 billion, in line with forecasts, and announced a jump in dividends alongside the buyback.

But the Asia-focused lender set out restrained new guidance, saying it expected income to grow at the higher end of 5-7% in 2024, lower than the previous estimate of 8-10% given last October. The lender booked 13% income growth in 2023 in constant currency terms.

StanChart also said it would aim to increase returns on tangible equity, a key profitability metric, ‚Äústeadily‚Äù from the current 10% to 12% by 2026, abandoning a previous forecast to hit 11% this year.

StanChart took a $850 million impairment mainly from its stake in Chinese lender Bohai Bank, its second time writing down the value of the unit as the lender was hit by increasing bad loans as growth in the world‚Äôs second-largest economy sputtered.

The hefty loss in China, a core target for StanChart‚Äôs strategy, underlines the challenge it faces to expand in the country as policymakers struggle to arrest a deepening property crisis and revive weak consumer confidence.

A fresh $150 million writedown of its stake in Bohai Bank, following a $700 million hit earlier this year, reduced its value to $700 million from $1.5 billion at the start of the year.

As well as hurting the value of StanChart‚Äôs investment in Bohai Bank, China‚Äôs real estate woes also hit the British bank directly as it took a further $282 million provision on expected loan losses relating to the sector.

936,Rivian and Lucid shares plunge after weak EV earnings reports,119,1axl48j,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1axl48j/rivian_and_lucid_shares_plunge_after_weak_ev/,56,"Shares of electric vehicle makers Rivian and Lucid plummeted Thursday after the companies reported disappointing results and stagnant production in their fourth-quarter earnings after the bell Wednesday.

Rivian shares plunged about 25% and Lucid‚Äôs stock sank almost 17% on Thursday.

Rivian forecast it will make 57,000 vehicles in 2024, slightly less than the 57,232 vehicles the company produced last year. Lucid said it expects to make 9,000 vehicles in 2024, about 7% more than the 8,428 vehicles it made in 2023.

Rivian‚Äôs revenue of $1.32 billion for the quarter beat Wall Street estimates, but its net loss per share of $1.36 was worse than expected, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv. The company also announced Wednesday it would cut 10% of its workforce.

‚ÄúOur business is not immune to existing economic and geopolitical uncertainties, most notably the impact of historically high interest rates, which has negatively impacted demand,‚Äù Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said on Wednesday‚Äôs earnings call.

Lucid reported lower-than-expected revenue of $157.2 million for the quarter, and its net loss of 30 cents per share was in line with estimates, according to analysts surveyed by LSEG.

Lucid CEO Peter Rawlinson said the macroeconomic environment and higher interest rates also affected the company. He said the company has had to learn to operate in new locations, such as Saudi Arabia, with different market dynamics.

Though companies have invested billions of dollars in EVs, sales have grown more slowly than expected. EVs made up 6.9% of sales heading into December, or roughly 976,560 units, up 1.7 percentage points compared with total sales in 2022. 

Rivian and Lucid make up a fraction of EV sales compared with the industry leader, Tesla. A Cox Automotive analysis found that Rivian accounted for just over 4% of EV sales in 2023, while Lucid made up 0.5%. Tesla controlled about 55% of the market.

Shares of Rivian have dropped about 40% in the past year and have fallen 85% from their initial public offering price of $78 a share in November 2021. Lucid‚Äôs stock is down about 70% in the past year and has dropped more than 75% from its IPO price of $14 a share in October 2021.

Rivian and Lucid weren‚Äôt the only EV producers Wall Street was watching Thursday.

Electric truck maker Nikola reported worse-than-expected revenue and a slightly better-than-expected loss per share in its earnings Thursday. The stock traded about flat Thursday, and has lost nearly all of its value since it hit an all-time high of $93.99 in June 2020.

938,"Nvidia- Don't Mistake a Highly Cyclical stock for Perpetual Growth. Perspective from a Software Engineer, why I set a $250 price target.",0,1axj4og,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1axj4og/nvidia_dont_mistake_a_highly_cyclical_stock_for/,227,"Nvidia is currently trading at over 100x earnings, but many investors will justify this by claiming that ""forward earnings"" is 25x. ""Forward earnings"" is just an estimate from analysts where they took past growth, and extrapolated it out into the future. 

These analysts do not understand the industry. They ignored AI for several years while CUDA was regularly being used in AI research and AI projects, setting price targets and earning estimates too low, and it only caught their attention as a growth engine when AI models started producing impressive media, rather than just boring scientific papers. Now, having seen earnings, they are assuming this growth will continue perpetually, without considering how the industry works.

Nvidia's growth in earnings is due to the surge in companies looking to fund AI projects. As a hot new trend, Even non-tech companies are trying to explore ways they can utilize AI, even in areas where it makes no sense and doesn't add any value. AI has essentially became a buzzword in the way that Blockchain was a few years ago, or ""internet"" was 25 years ago. Historically, these trends often last a couple years before slowing down considerably.

Since AI chips are a brand new market, companies are essentially building up AI infrastructure from nothing. And Nvidia is the only real supplier. Unlike other capital goods, there is no used/secondhand market yet. So in the short term, this has understandably meant exploding earnings as Nvidia can charge outrageous prices and faces no competition.

But will it last? It probably will in the short term, Nvidia can't ship enough chips yet to meet demand, and competitors will take time to produce viable alternatives, so there is probably a sales backlog that can keep them going a few quarters, possibly another year or two. But eventually supply will catch up to demand, and when that happens, growth will stagnate.

On top of this, a couple years down the line most companies will abandon their AI projects that don't work out.  When they do, you now have all of this used AI hardware(or cloud capacity) that is now on the market. Other companies can then buy this hardware at a discount, or cloud services now have less of a need to expand their AI compute capacity. This is exactly what happened with the crypto mining boom- Nvidia made a huge windfall from crypto mining sales, but then the market dried up, a huge oversupply hit the secondary market, and Nvidia's earnings stagnated until AI came to the rescue.

Now of course, you could argue that Nvidia will release better hardware every 2 years, and that will ensure they still have a market. And I think they will. 

But this introduces our next problem- suppliers. Nvidia is dependent on TSMC to produce their AI chips.  They could potentially use Samsung or Intel as well. They do not own their own fab.  Fortunately for them, they already had a lot of capacity they reserved with TSMC for their RTX 4000 GPUs, which they switched to produce AI chips, which has allowed them to produce a lot of AI chips for dirt cheap, and enjoy huge margins. But when Nvidia's contract with them runs out, they're at risk. Nvidia's 75% gross margin is well known. Additionally, it's almost certain that other companies like AMD are planning their own AI products. This explosion in manufacturing demand, combined with knowledge of Nvidia's high margins, will give TSMC leverage to raise their prices, threatening Nvidia's margins.

Our next issue is competitors. Nvidia may control nearly the entire  AI hardware market now, but is extremely unlikely to remain that way. AMD GPUs are just as capable of creating and running AI models as Nvidia, the main problem is most software is built for CUDA, which runs on Nvidia hardware.  

With the huge surge in the AI market, it's almost certain that there are companies out there developing AI models that can run on AMD, and it's very likely AMD is designing their own dedicated AI chips and software around it. There is tremendous amounts of money to be made in producing either cheaper hardware, or software that can run on cheaper hardware. If you look on LinkedIn, job boards, etc, you'll see semiconductor companies have hired and hiring large amounts of ML/AI engineers. And these listings don't mention CUDA. Assuming that Nvidia will never face any competition is na√Øve. Nvidia will probably remain a leader since they are ahead, but cheaper alternatives will threaten their pricing power.

Overall, the semiconductor industry is often a boom/bust industry, and I expect it will stay that way, even with AI. Investors should be careful buying during a boom period based on the assumption that it will continue booming.

All of this leads us to the valuation. Nvidia's quarterly earnings are likely to remain around $5 per share over the next few quarters, or possibly even grow a bit further, as demand remains high. But as competitors enter the market, a secondhand market emerges from failed startups, suppliers raise prices, and investor funding for AI startups dries up, I expect these earnings to decline over the next decade, until stabilizing when the industry matures

I ultimately decided on the following:

$25 earnings FY2025(a bit optimistic, that's assuming significant growth this year, more than analysts are predicting)

(5%) negative growth in earnings for a decade followed by 2% terminal growth rate as the industry matures and the race to the bottom ends.

The company plans to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ‚ÄúRDDT.‚Äù

Its market debut, expected in March, will mark the first major tech initial public offering of the year. It‚Äôs the first social media IPO since Pinterest went public in 2019.

Reddit first filed a confidential draft of its public offering prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission in December 2021.

The social media company, founded in 2005 by technology entrepreneurs Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman, has raised about $1.3 billion in funding and has a post valuation of $10 billion, according to deal-tracking service PitchBook.

Publishing giant Cond√© Nast bought Reddit in 2006 and then spun it out as an independent company in 2011.

As of October, Reddit had 70 million daily active users and over 100,000 active communities, or subreddits, according to its corporate website. Reddit is one of the most-visited websites in the U.S., according to analytics firm Semrush, but it has struggled to build an online advertising business comparable to tech giants like Facebook-parent Meta and Google-parent Alphabet.

It‚Äôs also faced challenges with developers and moderators.

In June, several prominent Reddit moderators locked subreddits as part of a blackout to protest the company‚Äôs decision to increase the price third-party developers pay to use its application programming interface, or API. At the time, Reddit said the pricing change was necessary because many big tech companies were using data to train large language models.

It is priced on the assumption of a distant future where there is a continued and growing demand for AI products, and where they face little competition.

The thing is, Nvidia's high gross margins are public knowledge. And they cannot produce enough chips. This gives fabs such as TSMC, Samsung, and possibly even Intel insane pricing power.

On top of all this, if a competitor happens to provide a viable alternative to Nvidia, it could put significant pressure on Nvidia's margins and market share, but the fabs could continue to charge high prices per wafer.

TSMC is trading at a P/E of 25 and Samsung 35, which is high, but not too high for a growing company.

There's a saying, ""During a gold rush, sell shovels"". A lot of people may say that Nvidia's AI chips are the shovels, but I'd argue the analogy leans more towards fabs like TSMC.

&#x200B;

*KEY POINTS*

* *Sales of previously owned homes rose in January, boosted by lower mortgage interest rates of November and December.*
* *Inventory of homes for sale in January increased to 1.01 million units, up 3.1% from January 2023, but still at a low 3-month supply.*
* *The median existing-home price for all housing types in January was $379,100, up 5.1% from a year earlier and an all-time high for the month of January.*

*Sales of previously owned homes rose 3.1% in January to 4 million units on a seasonally adjusted annualized basis, according to the National Association of Realtors. Sales were down 1.7% year over year.*

*The count is based on closings, so the contracts were likely signed in November and December, when mortgage interest rates backed off their October high of 8%. By mid-December, the rates had hit a recent low of around 6.6%. Today they are back over 7%, according to Mortgage News Daily.*

*‚ÄúWhile home sales remain sizably lower than a couple of years ago, January‚Äôs monthly gain is the start of more supply and demand,‚Äù said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the NAR. ‚ÄúListings were modestly higher, and home buyers are taking advantage of lower mortgage rates compared to late last year.‚Äù*

*Inventory of homes for sale in January increased to 1.01 million units, up 3.1% from January 2023, but still at a low 3-month supply. Six months is considered a balanced market between buyer and seller.*

*That dynamic is why the market is still seeing pressure on home prices. The median existing home price for all housing types in January was $379,100, up 5.1% from a year earlier and an all-time high for the month of January.*

*All four U.S. regions saw price increases, and 16% of homes were sold above list price.*

*‚ÄúMultiple offers are common on mid-priced homes, and many homes were still sold within a month. The elevated share of cash deals ‚Äì 32% ‚Äì indicated a market full of multiple offers and propelled by record-high housing wealth,‚Äù Yun said.*

*The 32% all-cash share was up from 29% in both December and in January 2022.*

*First-time buyers made up just 28% of sales. Historically they make up about 40%, but a lack of lower-priced homes for sale is hitting them hardest.*

*While lower mortgage rates helped boost January sales, today‚Äôs higher rates are already once again weighing on the market. A separate report from Redfin showed new listings rose 10% year over year during the four weeks ending February 18, the biggest increase in two months. Signed contracts, however, were down 7% from a year ago, according to the report.*",2024-02-22,0

‚Äôs full-year 2023 pretax profit missed analysts‚Äô estimates on Wednesday, hit by impairment costs linked to the London-based lender‚Äôs stake in a Chinese bank, sinking its shares as much as 5%.

Europe‚Äôs largest bank by assets saw its pre-tax profit climb about 78% to a record $30.3 billion in 2023 from a year ago, according to its statement released Wednesday during the mid-day trading break in Hong Kong. That missed median estimates of $34.06 billion from analysts tracked by LSEG.

Chief Executive Noel Quinn also announced an additional share buyback of up to $2 billion to be completed ahead of the bank‚Äôs next quarterly earnings report. HSBC also said it would consider offering a special dividend of 21 cents per share in the first half of 2024 after it completes the sale of its Canada business.

With the highest full-year dividend per share since 2008 and three share buy-backs in 2023 totaling $7 billion, Quinn said the bank returned $19 billion to shareholders last year.

HSBC suffered a ‚Äúvaluation adjustment‚Äù of $3 billion on its 19% stake in China‚Äôs Bank of Communications, Quinn said. In an interview with CNBC following the earnings release, he said this is ‚Äúa technical accounting adjustment‚Äù and ‚Äúnot a reflection‚Äù on BoComm.

This write-down was among the items that plunged the bank‚Äôs fourth-quarter pretax profit by 80% to $1 billion from a year earlier.

HSBC‚Äôs Hong Kong shares reversed gains of about 1% after trading resumed, falling as much as 5%. The benchmark Hang Seng Index
 was up about 2%.

Here are the other highlights of the bank‚Äôs full year 2023 financial report card:

- Revenue for 2023 increased by 30% to $66.1 billion, compared with the median LSEG forecast for about $66 billion.
- Net interest margin, a measure of lending profitability, was 1.66% ‚Äî compared with 1.48% in 2022.
- Common equity tier 1 ratio ‚Äî which measures the bank‚Äôs capital in relation to its assets ‚Äî was 14.8%, compared with 14.2% in 2022.
- Basic earnings per share was $1.15, compared with the median LSEG forecast for $1.28 in 2023 and 75 cents for 2022.
- Dividend per ordinary share was 61 cents ‚Äî the highest since 2008 ‚Äî compared with 32 cents in 2022.
Outlook 2024

HSBC, which has a second home in Hong Kong, said it was focusing on the fastest growing parts of Asia, a continent where the bank makes most of its profits.

In an earnings briefing to investors and analysts, the bank said it has completed the sale of its businesses in France, Oman, Greece and New Zealand, and was in the process of exiting Russia, Canada, Mauritius and Armenia.

962,Dividends Are stupid. Here's how Henry Singleton used this knowledge to outperform the S&P500 by 9x.,0,1aw48q7,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1aw48q7/dividends_are_stupid_heres_how_henry_singleton/,92,"TL;DR You don't want your company to pay a dividend.

Dr. Henry Singleton was the CEO of Teledyne from 1960-1986. During his tenure, he was known for his excellent capital allocation. By avoiding the common misconception that dividends were good, he was able to make strategic share repurchases **AND** dilutions to acquire companies. As a result, Teledyne achieved a 17.9% CAGR over 25 years, slightly outperforming the 8% CAGR achieved by the S&P500.

If you had invested $1, you would have received 61x your invested capital vs 6.7x for the S&P 500, simply for understanding why dividends are terrible.

To begin, let's understand what a dividend is. A dividend is a distribution of corporate earnings to shareholders. Great. But what does this really mean? To answer that, we need to understand an income statement and statement of cash flows.

When a business generates a profit, it is generally required to pay taxes on such profit (assuming no tax credits). This is reported as ""Net Income"" on the income statement. Then, this taxed profit moves on to the statement of cash flows. In ""Cash from Financing"", we can see that there are two line items: 

""Common Dividends Paid"" and ""Repurchase of Common Stock""

As we can see, these two line items are treated exactly the same. There is absolutely no preferential treatment for either item. As such, from a financial statement standpoint, these items are identical. However, you as an investor actually suffer from something else: qualified dividend tax.

Nonqualified dividends are taxed as ordinary income, the same as employee income. Qualified dividends are taxed at 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on your taxable income. So essentially, you are taxed twice as an investor. 

Well what about capital gains? As it turns out, LTCG are taxed **exactly the same**. So what then, is the difference between a qualified dividend and LTCG? A dividend is a **forced taxable sale event**. Receiving a dividend and selling a stock with no dividend is **EXACTLY THE SAME.** By holding a stock with no dividend, you are given favorable tax treatment as you can decide when you want to be taxed.

From a management standpoint, dividends defeat the entire purpose of investing in a company. When you invest in a company, you assume that the company will use your money to generate a greater return than you can. Why then, would you want this management team to simply return your own money back to you?

Now that we've covered how terrible dividends are, how did Singleton use this basic financial knowledge to outperform the SP500? First, he focused on making sure Teledyne was as efficient as possible. By retaining company profits and not constantly distributing profits (and thereby weakening the business), he was able to make strategic acquisitions. When Teledyne stock was overvalued (with a P/E in the 50s), Singleton was brilliant and **DILUTED** shareholders with by acquiring businesses with overvalued shares. He also **avoided dividends** as he wanted to avoid the double taxation for investors.

When the 1970s bear market hit, many companies suffered due to being overleveraged and constantly paying out dividends in past years. Teledyne was in no such position.

When their stock crashed in tandem in the market, they recognized that their stock was trading at a ridiculous discount to its intrinsic value. They took their war chest and invested $2.5 billion to repurchase **90%** of their stock. As a result, their EPS grew by **40x**. During his tenure as CEO, Singleton made sure to allocate every dollar generated to its maximum potential. As such, Teledyne crushed the S&P500 and made investors incredibly happy.",2024-02-21,0

News: Capital One to Buy Discover for $35 Billion in Year's Biggest Deal

  
SMCI- Hit that $1000, broke it, then utterly collapsed. I was out of town Friday, but this was probably the best trade of the year. Worth watching for any additional moves down, but other than that I‚Äôm going to be hands-off.

  
NVDA- Failed to break that $750 that I was interested in (highest we got was $745), and sold off at the open. For me, this is a hands-off until the earnings report. Looks like the semis/AI run-up might be over unless they report a blow-out earnings.

  
DFS- Capital One confirms that they are going to acquire DFS in all-stock transaction ($35.3B)

  
RAPT- Clinical hold placed on their asthma drug, stock is down 63% from the open. Worth watching to see if we break that $10 level for a multi-day swing trade.

977,Walmart beats Wall Street‚Äôs holiday expectations as e-commerce sales soar,85,1avhbt8,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1avhbt8/walmart_beats_wall_streets_holiday_expectations/,3,"Walmart said Tuesday that quarterly revenue rose 6%, as shoppers turned to the big-box retailer throughout the holiday season and the company‚Äôs global e-commerce sales grew by double digits. 

The retail giant also announced Tuesday that it would acquire smart TV maker Vizio to accelerate growth of its advertising business. Walmart is acquiring the company for $2.3 billion, or $11.50 per share. 

In a CNBC interview, Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said customers have still shown discretion with purchases. They are putting fewer items in their baskets but shopping more frequently, he said. Electronics, TVs, computers and some other expensive items have been a tougher sell, Rainey added.

Yet, he said even after the holiday rush, Walmart saw continued sales strength.

Here‚Äôs what Walmart reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: $1.80 adjusted vs. $1.65 expected

Revenue: $173.39 billion vs. $170.71 billion expected

In the three-month period that ended Jan. 31, Walmart‚Äôs net income fell to $5.49 billion or $2.03 per share, compared with $6.28 billion, or $2.32 per share, in the year-ago period.

Revenue increased from $164.05 billion in the year-ago period.

Walmart said it expects consolidated net sales to rise 4% to 5% in its fiscal first quarter. It also anticipates adjusted earnings of $1.48 to $1.56 per share on a pre-stock split basis.

For its fiscal 2025, the retailer expects consolidated net sales will climb 3% to 4%. Walmart anticipates adjusted earnings will be $6.70 to $7.12 per share on a pre-stock split basis.

Walmart has weathered high inflation better than many other retailers. It has used its value reputation to draw in families across income levels and has leaned into new ways to make money, such as selling ads, expanding its third-party marketplace and offering a subscription-based program called Walmart+.

Comparable sales, an industry metric also known as same-store sales, rose 4% for Walmart U.S. At Sam‚Äôs Club, comparable sales increased 1.9%, including fuel. 

Global e-commerce sales jumped 23% year over year, topping $100 billion in total. In the U.S., e-commerce rose 17% as shoppers used curbside pickup and got orders delivered to their homes.

Advertising has been a fruitful business for Walmart, too. It grew about 33% globally and 22% in the U.S. year over year.

Rainey said the Vizio acquisition will be ‚Äúan accelerant‚Äù for the ‚Äúhigh-margin, fast-growing part of our business.‚Äù

In the U.S., customer transactions increased 4.3% compared with the year-ago period. However, average ticket, or the amount that a customer spent, declined slightly. 

On its fiscal third-quarter earnings call in November, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said the company could soon face a deflationary environment, where prices are not just stabilizing, but going down. He said those lower prices could help customers pay for more discretionary items.

On Tuesday, however, Rainey said Walmart sees deflation as less likely now. In some categories of general merchandise, prices are lower than a year ago.

Yet, he added, food prices still rose by low single digits year over year.

‚ÄúThe possibility overall [of deflation] still remains, but prices are more stable than where they were three months ago,‚Äù he said.

As many other companies have announced cost cuts, Walmart has done the opposite. It announced in late January that it would open or expand more than 150 stores in the U.S. over the next five years. That‚Äôs on top of an aggressive plan to upgrade more than 1,400 of its existing Walmart stores to have a more modern look.

Along with those store investments, Walmart said it would raise store manager wages to an average of $128,000 per year and make managers eligible for a bonus of up to 200% of their base salary.

It also announced a 3-for-1 stock split in late January, as shares hovered near an all-time high.

Shares of Walmart closed Friday at $170.36, up about 8% so far this year. The stock has outperformed the S&P 500, which rose about 5% during the same period.

Walmart will acquire Vizio for $2.3 billion, or $11.50 per share, in cash. Vizio shares, which spiked after reports of the deal first emerged last week, closed at $9.53 on Friday.

The big-box retailer announced the acquisition as it reported fourth-quarter earnings.

Walmart and its Sam‚Äôs Club warehouse chain have long been major sellers of Vizio devices. But in buying the company, Walmart touted the potential to boost its ad business through Vizio‚Äôs SmartCast Operating System, which allows users to stream free ad-supported content on their TVs.

As it pushes for higher profits, the retail titan has tried to expand its media business Walmart Connect, which comes with bigger profit margins than selling groceries or clothing. The segment‚Äôs advertising sales grew 22% in the fourth quarter.

‚ÄúWe believe VIZIO‚Äôs customer-centric operating system provides great viewing experiences at attractive price points. We also believe it enables a profitable advertising business that is rapidly scaling,‚Äù said Seth Dallaire, executive vice president and chief revenue officer of Walmart U.S., in a statement.

979,"Home Depot beats earnings, sales estimates even as consumers take on smaller home improvement projects",262,1avg1ey,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1avg1ey/home_depot_beats_earnings_sales_estimates_even_as/,44,"Home Depot on Tuesday said quarterly sales declined nearly 3% year over year, but it surpassed Wall Street‚Äôs earnings and revenue expectations despite the cooler demand.

The home improvement retailer said it expects total sales to grow about 1% in fiscal year 2024, which includes an additional week. That compares with a 1.6% increase expected by Wall Street, according to StreetAccount. Home Depot also anticipates it will open about a dozen new stores during the year. 

On a call with CNBC, Chief Financial Officer Richard McPhail said demand dipped throughout the year as consumers returned to more typical spending patterns. He added that falling lumber prices and rising interest rates hurt the business.

Home Depot now sees a chance to return to growth, McPhail said.

‚ÄúOur market is on its way back to normal demand conditions,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not quite there yet, but the pressures we saw in 2023 are receding.‚Äù

Here‚Äôs what the company reported for the three-month period ended Jan. 28 compared with what Wall Street expected, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: $2.82 vs. $2.77 expected

Revenue: $34.79 billion vs. $34.64 billion expected

Home Depot shares more than 3% in premarket trading.

Net income for the fiscal fourth quarter fell to $2.80 billion, or $2.82 per share, from $3.36 billion, or $3.30 per share, a year earlier. 

Net sales decreased from $35.83 billion in the year-ago period.

Home Depot has faced a tougher sales backdrop over the past year. The home improvement retailer is following a more than two-year period when Americans had more time and money to spend on painting and fixing up their homes during the pandemic. 

The company has also felt a pullback in consumer spending, particularly on big-ticket items, as some families postpone discretionary purchases because of inflation, put off buying a new home because of higher interest rates or choose to spend on experiences rather than goods.

Throughout the past year, McPhail and CEO Ted Decker described 2023 as ‚Äúa year of moderation‚Äù after the outsized gains during the pandemic.

On Tuesday, McPhail said customers are still putting off bigger projects ‚Äì especially the large-scale projects that may require a loan ‚Äì because of higher borrowing costs.  

Yet he said sales throughout the fourth quarter were pretty consistent, except for a decline in January due to colder and wetter weather. He said that temporary drop did not factor into the company‚Äôs outlook for the year ahead. 

Average ticket and customer transactions both declined in the fourth quarter compared with the year-ago period. Average ticket dropped to $88.87 from $90.05 in the year-ago quarter, reflecting a more typical pricing environment, McPhail said.

As of Friday‚Äôs close, shares of Home Depot were up nearly 5% this year. That roughly matches the gains of the S&P 500 during the same period. The company‚Äôs shares closed at $362.35 on Friday, bringing Home Depot‚Äôs market value to about $360 billion.

The saying implies that if you are coming from a position of wanting to sell some of your stocks, that you should favour keeping those that have performed well during the time that you have owned them.

I think that this premise is flawed, and following it willingly introduces a bias towards your decision making based on nothing but your own personal experience and emotions. 

In my view the price performance of a stock during the time you have owned it should ideally form no part of the calculation of whether to keep the stock. This calculation should be based purely on the perceived fair value of the company and their expected future performance. It is irrelevant whether a stock has gone up while you have owned it. 

So let‚Äôs say you buy and the stock enters or continues an uptrend for a couple of years, following this advice you should keep that stock. However you having owned the stock makes no difference to the performance of the company or stock, so therefore in keeping with this logic of favouring your winners, why not just buy any company in a sustained up trend, and discard any in a downtrend? This is essentially what you are doing. Yes you have the safety net of your gains, but you are also presumably realising losses on companies that have performed poorly during whatever time you have happened to have owned them, in a similarly biased manner.

If the idea is ‚Äúgo with the trend‚Äù then why not simplify it to this and take out the irrelevant part about you having owned the stock during this trend?

I think this strategy may help emotionally to some degree with investing, by cutting and forgetting about potentially bad buys. This is fine and makes sense. Psychology is half the battle with investing in my opinion. But if it is a psychological trick we should acknowledge this, because the reasoning behind this advice is fuzzy at best. People just seem to latch onto it and pass it on without actually thinking about the mechanism for why it is a good strategy, if it is at all.

I‚Äôm not a fan in general of these investing quotes that people tend to throw around. They‚Äôre often open to so much interpretation that they can misguide people trying to learn their way in investing, and even trick yourself.

I think they‚Äôre going to fall short on expectations and guide lower on gross profit margin.  Expectations are high, but the steep discounts suggest a revenue miss.  GPS hired a high fashion guy to make changes.  I have doubts those changes will work.  It‚Äôll turn off the existing customer and Temu is making it difficult to acquire new apparel customers.

The price has run up from less than $8 last summer.  With a $1 EPS estimated for the next 12 months, the forward PE is about 20.  Ralph Lauren and Tapestry have recently reported good earnings; however it was driven by international sales.  GPS had a big Q3 that sent the stock up 50%.  Strong Gap results are priced in. 

Here‚Äôs what the stock analysts at CFRA have to say with a price target of $12, down from the current $19.75 share price.  Gap nailed the athleisure trend with Athleta, but now they‚Äôve got tough year over year comparables.

‚ÄúOur Sell opinion and price target reflect our view that GPS is in a transition period as it continues to close stores of its less profitable brands (Gap and Banana Republic) while seeing a slowdown at Athleta. We expect this transition to continue to weigh on earnings and revenues in the near term. We see potential in the company‚Äôs Athleta brand even after revenue growth deceleration in recent quarters and believe the brand is well positioned in the athleisure space. We expect continued promotional activity to plague margins and would steer clear of shares of GPS in the near term while a shakeup in leadership causes more uncertainty surrounding shares.‚Äù

Gap hired Zac Posen two weeks ago as creative director of GAP and Old Navy.  His background is in high fashion and judge on project runway.  He does not have a track record of profitably selling mass market clothes.

The following year, the ‚ÄúZac Posen‚Äù name and IP were sold to the licensing firm Centric Brands.

The [clearance sections](https://www.gap.com/browse/category.do?cid=65289&nav=hamnav%3AMen%3ACategories%3ASale#pageId=0&department=75) at GAP have an extra 50% off plus another 20% with the promo code TREAT.  That‚Äôs a signal that they are dumping inventory at a loss, either because they want to rebrand, they missed their revenue estimates, or both.  It‚Äôs not just the quantity of items with a steep discount.  It‚Äôs the full assortment of sizes and colors on quality merchandise.  Part of the large recent share price increase was driven by getting inventory levels under control.  If they went into Q4 with a desirable level of inventory, why did they come out of Q4 needing to slash prices?

Old Navy is supposed to be their profit center.  The women‚Äôs [clearance section](https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/category.do?cid=96964&nav=hamnav%3AWomen%3ADeals%3AClearance#department=136) has 1990 item deeply discounted with an additional 30% off.  My theory is they missed revenue estimates and are dumping inventory to shift merchandising strategy.  They‚Äôll pull forward demand selling at a low gross profit margin to their current customer.  Then their customer will go through a period where they won‚Äôt make any full price purchases.  At the same time, they‚Äôll launch their newly designed Posen product.  The current customer liked their old product.  That‚Äôs why they were a customer.  GPS will have to acquire new customers.  

Temu and Shein are taking market share.  It‚Äôs getting harder to digitally acquire customers as the Chinese companies bid up marketing costs.  They now generate [10% of Facebook‚Äôs revenue.](https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/temu-is-spending-like-billionaire-2024-02-12/)",2024-02-19,0

I have tried this approach the past few years and it has been successful. I bought Etsy shares when I first started to use Etsy. I bought Celsius shares when I first started drinking Celsius. Also, got some planet fitness stock when I first started going there on a regular basis. 

I have been keeping an eye out for the next product that I use everyday, but would love to hear about other peoples. What product have you recently started using everday that you love?

It can be a device, a subscription, a restaurant, clothing. You name it.  

Would love to know what everyone has to say!

998,Can a company delist its stock from one exchange and move it to another in a different country?,9,1auipch,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1auipch/can_a_company_delist_its_stock_from_one_exchange/,9,"I own some shares of a junior copper mining company (Solaris Resources -SLS). The stock is on the TSX.V. 

They have accepted a 100M offer from a Chinese state owned to Corp to buy 15% of their main asset and they are planning on selling the asset to the Chinese once they have completed the permitting process.

The location of the asset is in Ecuador and the company's HQ is in Vancouver,BC. 

The issue is Canada recent spats with China have led to the Canadian Government to put new regulations on mining companies transacting with China. 

The 100m accepted offer is under review by the Canadian Government right now and it feels like it is a bit of a coin toss on whether they will approve it or not.

This got me thinking, if Canada does not approve it, would the company be able to move their HQ and stock to another Country/Exchange that has more favourable regulations regarding China?

The asset in Ecuador is the only one of real value in their portfolio and other than having their head office in Canada they don't have any other ties to Canada. 

Ive been trying to research this topic to no avail as its a pretty rare issue for a company to face. 

Wondering if anyone here knows of a company who has delisted and moved their HQ/stock to another exchange in a Country with a more favourable regulatory environment, if so could you let me know the name or ticker?

Disney plans to start a massive, all sports channels one-stop-OTT platform with WB and Fox at 33% partnership each this year to consolidate sports under one banner. At the same time Disney plans to launch its flagship ESPN sports OTT platform by fall of next year. Wouldn't the two conflict with each other, marketshare wise, in an already saturated OTT field? Why would Disney announce two back-to-back, very related projects? Is this solely to appease investors ahead of this years GM due to the activist investors? Or is there value in this play?

The two new directors are Jesse Lynn, general counsel of Icahn Enterprises, and Steven Miller, a portfolio manager of Icahn Capital.

Shares of JetBlue were up about 4% in after-hours trading following the announcement.

The JetBlue investment isn‚Äôt Icahn‚Äôs first investment in the airline industry. In one of his more infamous activist campaigns, the corporate raider took TWA private in the late 1980s, and the airline struggled and filed for bankruptcy.

Icahn said in disclosing his JetBlue stake that he believes the shares are undervalued. JetBlue‚Äôs stock is down more than 19% over the past 12 months as of Friday‚Äôs close. The NYSE Arca Airline Index, which tracks the broader sector, is up about 7% during the same period.

JetBlue‚Äôs new CEO, Joanna Geraghty, took the helm Monday, and the carrier has appointed a pair of airline veterans to get it back on track.

‚ÄúBuilding on our distinct brand and unique value proposition, we are focused on delivering value to our shareholders and all of our stakeholders, and we welcome the contributions of our new board members as we move forward with that common goal,‚Äù Geraghty said in a statement on Friday.

JetBlue hasn‚Äôt posted a profit since before the Covid-19 pandemic and has been cutting costs, trying to become more reliable after a post-Covid travel surge and a blocked merger with budget carrier Spirit Airlines. A federal judge last month ruled against a combination of the two airlines, citing reduced competition.

JetBlue had argued it needed the tie-up to help it compete against the largest American carriers. JetBlue and Spirit are appealing the judge‚Äôs ruling.

The Beaverton, Oregon-based sneaker giant said it wants to better use its capital to invest in its growth areas, such as running, women‚Äôs and the Jordan brand.

‚ÄúThis is how we will reignite our growth,‚Äù CEO John Donahoe said in a memo obtained by CNBC.

‚ÄúThis is a painful reality and not one that I take lightly,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúWe are not currently performing at our best, and I ultimately hold myself and my leadership team accountable.‚Äù

Nike said the layoffs will take place in two phases. The company will start the first round this week, and finish the second by the end of its fiscal fourth quarter, which typically concludes at the end of May. Cuts in Nike‚Äôs EMEA region will be on a different timeline based on local labor laws, the company said.

It‚Äôs not clear which departments will experience layoffs, but they will not affect retail employees at Nike‚Äôs stores or warehouse workers, the company said.

The cuts come as consumers become more cautious in their spending and the retail industry braces for a demand slowdown for discretionary items such as clothes and shoes, which is Nike‚Äôs bread and butter.

In December, Nike unveiled a broad restructuring plan to cut costs by about $2 billion over the next three years. It lowered its sales outlook as it prepared for lower demand and wholesale orders, soft sales online and a marketplace that relies more on promotions.

As part of its plan to cut costs, Nike said it was looking to simplify its product assortment, increase automation and its use of technology, streamline the organization by reducing management layers and leverage its scale ‚Äúto drive greater efficiency.‚Äù

Shortly before the restructuring was announced, The Oregonian reported that Nike had been quietly laying off employees over the past several weeks and had signaled that it was planning for a broader restructuring. A series of divisions saw cuts, including recruitment, sourcing, brand, engineering, human resources and innovation, the outlet reported.

It‚Äôs not clear how many jobs in total Nike has cut since December.

On Friday morning, Oppenheimer downgraded Nike to perform and lowered its 12- to 18-month price target, citing sluggish consumer demand, lulls in production innovation and competition.

‚ÄúWhile NKE is by no means broken, we believe that the company and its brand are transitioning, near-term,‚Äù the firm said.

Donahoe said laid off staffers will receive a comprehensive package of financial, health-care and outplacement support services.

‚ÄúWe will emerge stronger and better equipped to fulfill our purpose to serve all athletes and grow the future of sport,‚Äù Donahoe said.

Wanted to start a conversation about which companies/industries this is going to hurt the most or obscurely gain from it as well as the future.

Don't say NVDA, that's obvious and probably priced well in by now.

My uneducated opinion on this is that it seems like the following will be hurt:

\- Providing video advertising services to networks will die a terminal death

\- Short-form video developers -> won't be needed

Sectors that could gain:

\- Entertainment producers -> lower cost base to financing entertainment

Later on indie game publishers could also gain if generative AI providers lower development costs of indie games.

1019,Ultimate Nvidia DD (The Best),5,1asfjmv,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1asfjmv/ultimate_nvidia_dd_the_best/,35,"First things first: This deep dive isn't about Nvidia's next earnings call or the coming few months. We're zooming out here, looking at Nvidia from a mid to long-term investment lens.  
  
It seemed to me like common knowledge that Nvidia's future valuation is way overvalued, yet it turns out many are still in the dark.  
No, betting against Nvidia doesn't mean you're anti-AI. It means you're skeptical about Nvidia's monopolistic hype in the AI space.  
  
First, let's start with the obvious. How has the value of Nvidia, which previously generated half of its revenue from games, skyrocketed recently?  
  
You could say it‚Äôs because of AI. But that can easily be misunderstood.  
It would be much better to say: It's because of ChatGPT.  
  
AI-focused development started a long, long time ago. Yes, AI is the future, but your neighbor doesn't believe you because he believes that only humans can solve certain tasks.  
  
How did the general public attitude shift towards a complete AI-Hype?  
Because a new product came onto the market with many great Breakthroughs. But it‚Äôs not just any Product. It‚Äôs a Product that is easy to understand, easy to use by everybody and FOR everybody.  
An AI Product that Businesses AND Consumers can understand.  
  
This General public attention has made OpenAI so important, it changed from OPENAI to CLOSEDAI and is now profit oriented (look up their background story).  
  
This general public attention has caused every other company investing in AI to release their unfinished product to market. That's how we got Bard from Google. That's how we got these Donald Trump AI images because companies didn't even bother to invest time in developing better security filters. They had to release their product NOW.  
  
They gave a shit about errors in their product or high costs. They had to be FIRST, or at least not late to the party.  
  
How did Meta train LLama? With NVIDIA gpus. Same as Microsoft/Openai and everybody else.  
  
Why did they Choose NVIDIA? I wrote an analogy about this in a comment (which I'm copying into this DD). But first, consider these important facts:  
  
\- Nvidia is a fabless company. Their stock market value is not covered by material equivalents, their capital consists of the intellectual output of their employees  
  
\- Nearly nobody can replace/compete with TSMC (Intel is trying to)  
  
\- Every major company that has invested in NVIDIA has announced that they are working on their own custom chips (this will also improve performance since the chip is designed FOR their specific AI development)  
  
\- Nvidia is currently winning with a product that they sell to other companies. It's not a product that they sell to retail customers  
  
The Analogy:  
  
‚ÄûPrivate customers want tables and other furniture made of wood. The companies that make this furniture need an axe to cut down trees (wood).  
  
TSMC can be described as the trees. Nvidia sells an axe that can be used to cut down trees.  
  
The TSMC trees are a special kind of trees. They are more robust than other trees, but at the same time you have to be careful when you cut them down because they can break.  
  
At the moment, everyone wants furniture made from these special trees because they are better than ordinary furniture, they look better and they are robust. You could say they are the future of furniture.  
  
Nvidia currently sells an axe that was invented for similar trees, and that also seems to be the best axe on the market for the TSMC trees.  
  
Everyone is stocking up on equipment and buying Nvidia axes. But there are 2 problems: Nvidia axes are really good for cutting down these trees, but not perfect. Also, Nvidia axes are quite expensive because they currently dominate the market.  
  
What is happening now is that companies are developing their own axes to save money and optimize the tree cutting process.  
  
Does this mean that Nvidia will no longer optimize its axes and lose all market share? No. Does this mean that Nvidia might be overvalued and not the only go-to company for these axes? Could this mean that they won't quadruple their profits every year? Yes.‚Äú  
  
\----  
  
NVIDIA made a design available at a specific time frame where companies invested heavily in gpu chips to train AIs. The Design Nvidia delivered was the best performing at the market. But it is not the best design. Training LLMs would have been better with customized chips. But designing chips takes some time, at least 1-2 years. So what did companies like Microsoft/OpenAi, Meta and Google do? Train their LLMs on Nvidia Chips.  
  
Someone said to me that NVIDIA is future proof because designing chips is not easy and that‚Äôs their moat. This tells me that the person doesn‚Äôt know the process behind chip production. We can even look at each company involved here and get a simple, clear picture.  
  
NVIDIA does NOT produce chips. They ‚Äûonly‚Äú design them.  
  
Which company produces NVIDIAs Chips? It‚Äôs TSMC.  
TSMC by the way also produces Chips for AMD. And for Apple.  
  
So there is one specific major company that produces chips for every big ‚ÄûChip Design Company‚Äú. Why are they all using this single company that could (will) be attacked by China one day and disrupt their entire supply chain? Because THAT is the really difficult ‚Äúmoat‚Äù part with AI chips. This company is the only one truly relevant for AI growth. Anyone can design chips, but only one company can make them.  
  
There are of course small exceptions. Some companies design AND produce their own chips. And we have to look at them. Not to invest in them, but to better understand why Nvidia doesn't have future moat.  
  
So which famous company produces their own Chips? Intel.  
Do you know why Intel lost so much market share to AMD?  
This is the reason. Because they produce their own chips. Not because of the design.  
  
Building a chip factory is a highly complex, highly expensive matter and takes years. Intel was slower than the competition. They were stuck with the old NM production processes and couldn't get their new systems up and running fast enough.  
  
AMD was winning market share because TSMC produces their Chips.  
  
Intel now changed their strategy. They now let their competitor, TSMC, produce their chips so they can stay in the market. In the meantime they‚Äôre building new chip factories and want to swap to their own production again.  
  
According to estimates, Intel will pay TSMC 14 billion US dollars over the next two years - for 3-nanometer chips.  
  
Now, you might argue that chip design is still difficult and believe that NVIDIA will be the future for all AI chip designs - despite every major AI Company literally saying they will design their own chips?!  
  
Ok, here is an example where a famous company used primarily Nvidia chips but stopped doing so:  
  
‚ÄûHowever, in 2010, Apple made a significant decision that would alter its GPU trajectory. The company began developing its own graphics technology, resulting in the creation of the Metal framework. Metal allowed developers to access the full power of Apple‚Äôs GPUs, optimizing performance and efficiency. This move signaled a shift away from Nvidia‚Äôs GPUs, as Apple sought to establish greater control over its hardware and software integration.  
  
Since then, Apple has predominantly relied on its in-house GPU solutions, including those integrated into its A-series chips found in iPhones and iPads. These custom-designed GPUs have showcased impressive performance and power efficiency, further solidifying Apple‚Äôs commitment to developing its own graphics technology.‚Äú (Does Apple use Nvidia? (ts2.com.pl)  
  
Because you are all regarded, here are the links where major companies have declared that they will design their own chips:

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

This is the new space race, we cant let the Russians win.  
mRNA and genomic research hold great promise in revolutionizing cancer treatment and potentially offering a cure. One key advantage is in the personalized approach they offer. Researching a persons genetics enables scientists to understand the genetic makeup of individual tumors, leading to a tailored treatment that targets the specific mutations driving cancer growth. By analyzing the unique genetic signatures of tumors, researchers can identify vulnerabilities and develop mRNA-based therapies that precisely instruct the immune system to recognize and destroy cancer cells.  
mRNA has demonstrated remarkable versatility and safety in delivering the treatment. Unlike traditional treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation (Nuking the immune system), which can cause severe side effects due to their nonspecific targeting, mRNA vaccines and therapies have shown the ability to selectively target cancer cells while sparing healthy tissues. This targeted approach minimizes adverse effects and enhances the effectiveness of treatment, offering new hope to patients battling various forms of cancer.  
I think the true benefit that humanity will have from AI is disease research. The significant contribution of AI lies in its ability to analyze huge amounts of data efficiently and accurately. In cancer research, AI algorithms can sift through extensive genomic data, medical records, imaging scans, and scientific literature to identify patterns, correlations, and potential treatment options that might otherwise be overlooked by human researchers. What normally would take years can now take days or weeks.

‚ÄúWe are cautiously optimistic that the worst is over for office leasing, particularly for Class A properties where we generate approximately two-thirds of our leasing revenue,‚Äù CBRE said in a call with analysts Thursday morning.

That optimistic tone could help quell worries about the market for commercial real estate that have roiled shares in property managers and lenders from New York to Munich and Japan in recent weeks. New York Community Bancorp shares characterized the turmoil after plunging last week when it reported a surprise loss, prompting regulators and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to caution about exposure to the sector.

Office occupancy in major cities around the world has been slow to recover in many instances, leaving property managers and their lenders potentially exposed to losses. CBRE executives said that the worst of that has passed.

‚ÄúWe think it is bottomed out,‚Äù said Robert Sulentic, chief executive officer. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs just a clear amount of pressure from companies to get their people back into the office. You‚Äôre going to see the future be better than the current circumstances have been for a variety of reasons.‚Äù

Shares of NYCB rose 6.3%, while a measure of regional bank stocks added 3.6%, the biggest one-day gain since mid-December. The group had been under pressure since NYCB‚Äôs surprise loss and as investors scoured balance sheets for exposure to potentially loss-making property loans.

CBRE reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.38, topping the average analyst estimate of $1.18, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue in the quarter rose more than 9% to about $9 billion, beating expectations for of $8.47 billion.

But it was CBRE‚Äôs annual profit forecast that helped ease some concerns about the state of the market. For 2024, the firm said it expects to achieve core earnings-per-share of $4.25 to $4.65, implying growth that is above 10%.

That guide may even be on the conservative side, according to JP Morgan analysts led by Anthony Paolone.

‚ÄúOur read from comments on this front is that it is baking in conservatism and giving itself a decent amount of room in the bottom-line numbers if the backdrop changes and negatively impacts the top line,‚Äù Paolone wrote in a note. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs positive, in our view, and we‚Äôd also argue it suggests the business is trending better than feared for all the names in the space at the moment.‚Äù

Stephen Sheldon of William Blair also said that there are clear secular growth drivers supporting larger commercial real estate service firms with CBRE leading the industry.

‚ÄúWe believe there could be a multiple re-rating for the CRE group across the cyclical spectrum (early cycle, mid-cycle, and late cycle) that could support returns for CBRE shareholders over the medium term,‚Äù Sheldon wrote in a note.",2024-02-16,0

The company also reported fourth-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street‚Äôs expectations.

Shares were initially up as much as 16% after hours but then gave back much of the gains.

Here‚Äôs how the company did, compared with the consensus among analysts polled by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: Loss of 7 cents per share, vs. loss of 11 cents per share expected

Revenue: $1.04 billion vs. $1.02 billion expected

Toast‚Äôs revenue increased almost 35% year over year during the quarter, according to a statement. Its net loss of $36 million narrowed from $99 million in the year-ago quarter. The company has committed $250 million for share buybacks.

The pandemic lead many restaurants to adopt Toast‚Äôs tools for mobile ordering and payments, which helped double the company‚Äôs revenue. Shares debuted on the New York Stock Exchange in 2021, in the midst of that uptick. Demand has cooled since then, down from 37% in the third quarter and about 45% in the second quarter.

Toast faces increasing competition from the likes of Block, Fiserv and Shift4, Bank of America analysts wrote in a December note as they reduced their rating on the stock from buy to neutral.

Despite the competition, transactions using Toast products continue to grow. Gross payment volume, at $33.70 billion, was up 32%, higher than the $33.53 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount.

Toast‚Äôs new job cuts should result in $45 million to $55 million in charges, mostly in the first quarter, and $100 million in annualized savings.

Those cuts come weeks after Aman Narang, Toast‚Äôs co-founder and COO, replaced Chris Comparato as CEO. Under Comparato‚Äôs leadership last summer, Toast started charging a fee of 99 cents for each online order that totaled more than $10. Consumers and restaurant owners objected, prompting the company to eliminate the surcharge.

Narang said on a conference call with analysts that management aims to report operating profit in the first half of 2025.

Adjusting for one-time items, Shake Shack reported earnings per share of 2 cents.

The burger chain also saw a 20% increase in revenue year over year and opened 15 new restaurants during the quarter.

1043,Google (GOOG) DCF Analysis,56,1area1r,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1area1r/google_goog_dcf_analysis/,37,"**NOTE NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE**

# Introduction:

GOOG has a very simplistic goal in their business, yet this simple goal managed to carry GOOG's market cap to a trillion dollar. GOOG's main business model is centered around helping consumers sieve through large chunks of data to find what they need or want to find. Recently, with the announcement of Gemini, GOOG's GenAI, it led to a temporary spike in stock prices as investors believed that Gemini would be able to compete with ChatGPT. I believe that the advancement of GenAI is necessary for GOOG given how reliant they are on Search revenue.

# Revenue:

The success of GOOG‚Äôs advertising is hinged on 2 criteria, being able to attract and retain users and being able to monetize advertisers.

***For attracting and retaining users,***

1. GOOG released Gemini their generative AI to help complement Search. This allows users to process information faster or seek answers more efficiently.
2. GOOG has entered into a deal with AAPL to make Google the default search engine on Safari. This deal is estimated to be worth about 18 billion per year.
3. There is a large switching cost for long-term users to switch over to a rival search engine. This is so because using the Google search engine means that there is a high chance users will be indoctrinated into the GOOG ecosystem (E.g. Gmail, Google Drive, etc.).

***For monetizing advertisers,***

1. GOOG is one of the largest platforms that advertisers can advertise on. The type of information that users receive is dependent on GOOG, GOOG controls the information flow to consumers and hence is a powerful platform for advertisers to advertise on.

Apart from these factors, GOOG has begun targeting SMBs (Small and Midsize Businesses).

How GOOG sees SMBs (Small, Medium Businesses) advertising with them is that GOOG will provide Gen AI to generate images/captions for their ad campaign then SMBs use these advertising materials and advertise on Search.

When forecasting advertising revenue, opting for less granularity, and due to a lack of public data, I lumped both search and YouTube together. Taking the number of YouTube users as a proxy for the popularity of GOOG‚Äôs advertising tools.

So, I assumed that it would take 1 year for GOOG to finish and get Gemini up to speed. I assumed that it takes about 2 years for consumers to get used to Gemini and for advertisers to notice this shift. This quick adaptation is because ChatGPT took off very quickly within the year it was released.

When forecasting revenue/users, due to the macro constraints and pessimism advertisers are cautious about advertising so the revenue/users have been dropping for the past 2 years. I assume it takes 2 years for the macro outlook to improve and during the high growth period, revenue/users grow as well as more advertisers start spending more.

&#x200B;

When forecasting Google Subscriptions + Others, which entails YouTube premium, GOOG devices, and Google Play revenue. I assumed that the success of this category is based on YouTube Premium so I forecasted this revenue segment based on the number of subscribers to YouTube Premium. Number of Subscribers in 2022 ([SOURCE](https://www.billboard.com/business/streaming/youtube-music-premium-subscribers-how-many-1235594920/#:~:text=That's%20up%20from%20the%2080,at%20the%20end%20of%202021)). Comparing Youtube Music to its strongest competitor Spotify, Spotify has a large switching cost due to years worth of playlists built that would be lost by switching over. On top of that, having to learn the new UI of YouTube Music and the lack of certain features that Spotify users are used to.So, the main driver for this segment would be YouTube Premium, given the indispensable nature of YouTube due to the strong network effect and new frontiers such as YouTube Shorts that are driving people to YouTube, and the longer unskippable ads, all these factors are driving people to subscribe to YouTube Premium. However, I‚Äôm cautious about how much or how fast YouTube Premium will grow. Due to strong competitors such as TikTok and Spotify, I‚Äôd assume the historic large growth will taper downwards as the high historic growth was due to the low-hanging fruits being picked.

&#x200B;

When forecasting Revenue/Users, as GOOG wants to keep their prices low to attract users to YouTube Premium, historically the revenue/users have been declining. However, as recently as July 2023 GOOG started hiking prices. So, I‚Äôd assume that in my forecast from FY24 onwards, the Revenue/Users begin rising.  Historic price hikes have been at around 16%, I‚Äôd assume that GOOG no longer pursues such aggressive price rises and begins tapering down their price increases. Their perpetual Revenue/users growing in line with the perpetual inflation rate.

&#x200B;

When forecasting Google Cloud revenue, since there isn‚Äôt available relevant data to create a bottoms-up revenue model I forecasted it as Y/Y growth. Taking into account ([SOURCE](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/cloud-computing-industry)). Given that GOOG mainly offers IAAS and SAAS for cloud computing, as businesses begin ramping up their digital efforts in line with the global push towards digitalization there is an increasing demand for IAAS and SAAS cloud computing, especially for IAAS which is stated to have the highest growth rate. I assumed that GOOG‚Äôs cloud revenue grew at a Y/Y CAGR of 19.3%.

# Cost:

When forecasting COGS, TAC accounted for about 40% of COGS as per 2023 10-K. I assumed that TAC would tend slightly upwards due to the competition for traffic increasing from competitors such as TikTok.

When forecasting R&D and marketing, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.

When forecasting G&A, management has stated that there is a potential usage of AI to reduce the need for labor. I‚Äôd assume that G&A tends downward slightly.

# WACC:

RFR (1M Avg) = 4.14%

Beta ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/)) = 1.06

Stable market ERP ([SOURCE](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/ctryprem.html)) = 4.60%

Conclusion:

Ultimately, in my base case, I value GOOG at $143.16 per share. I believe that GOOG is a company with strong growth potential. However, given that GOOG is a household name and especially with the recent hype when they announced gemini it has led to a lot of enthusiasm and bullish outlook that caused their prices to temporarily spike upwards.

A recession is defined as two consecutive three-month periods where the economy contracts rather than grows.

A major measure of economic growth, gross domestic product (GDP) shrank 0.3% between October and December, the latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) data shows.

It's a steeper fall than expected by economists who had forecast a 0.1% contraction.

It followed 0.1% of negative economic growth in the three months from July to September.

The data, however, is just an estimate and is subject to revision.

It‚Äôs the latest example of how the artificial intelligence boom has sent the chipmaker‚Äôs stock soaring.

Nvidia rose over 2% to close at $739.00 per share, giving it a market value of $1.83 trillion to Google‚Äôs $1.82 trillion market cap. The move comes one day after Nvidia surpassed Amazon in terms of market value.

The symbolic milestone is more confirmation that Nvidia has become a Wall Street darling on the back of elevated AI chip sales, valued even more highly than some of the large software companies and cloud providers that develop and integrate AI technology into their products.

Nvidia shares are up over 221% over the past 12 months on robust demand for its AI server chips that can cost more than $20,000 each. Companies like Google and Amazon need thousands of them for their cloud services. Before the recent AI boom, Nvidia was best known for consumer graphics processors it sold to PC makers to build gaming computers, a less lucrative market.

Google was largely expected to benefit from AI, especially since employees at the company pioneered many of the techniques ‚Äî such as transformer architecture ‚Äî used in cutting-edge models like ChatGPT.

Google shares are still up 55% in the past 12 months, though the company has grappled with layoffs and culture issues after it declared a ‚Äúcode red‚Äù situation to build AI services into its products. Google announced a $20 per month AI subscription called Gemini Advanced earlier this week, one of its first paid generative AI products.

Nvidia is now the third largest U.S. company, only behind Apple and Microsoft. Nvidia reports quarterly earnings on Feb. 21. Analysts expect 118% annual growth in sales to $59.04 billion.

Shares were down 4% in extended trading.

It‚Äôs the latest tech company to downsize in 2024, as the industry continues to squeeze out costs following the market downturn that hit two years ago. January was the busiest month for job cuts in the industry since March, as Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft and SAP all said they were eliminating positions, as did eBay Unity and Discord. So far this year, 144 tech companies have laid off almost 35,000 workers, according to the website Layoffs.fyi.

In addition to disclosing the job cuts, Cisco reported strong fiscal second-quarter results but gave a light forecast. Here‚Äôs how it did in comparison with the consensus from LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: 87 cents, adjusted, vs. 84 cents expected

Revenue: $12.79 billion, vs. $12.71 billion expected

Cisco‚Äôs revenue declined 6% year over year during the quarter, which ended on Jan. 27, according to a statement. Net income declined to $2.63 billion, or 65 cents per share, from $2.77 billion, or 67 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.

Revenue from networking products totaled $7.08 billion, slightly below the $7.10 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount.

With respect to guidance, Cisco called for 84 to 86 cents per share on $12.1 billion to $12.3 billion. Analysts polled by LSEG were looking for 92 cents per share on $13.09 billion in revenue.

For the full year, Cisco sees $3.68 to $3.74 in adjusted earnings per share and $51.5 billion to $52.5 billion in revenue. Analysts had projected $3.86 in adjusted earnings per share, with $54.26 billion in revenue.

1059,Calculating possible range of return on bond ETFs?,0,1aqlij6,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1aqlij6/calculating_possible_range_of_return_on_bond_etfs/,2,"How do you calculate the potential range of returns on bond ETFs? With a plain old bond, I know I will make say, 3% in a year if I hold the bond. But with the ETF it's really unclear to me. Can my return be negative/unbounded-below due to interest rate risk (not considering bonds defaulting)? If so, then that seems to make bond ETFs less appealing because my profit is less certain?

Suppose I have a toy example of a bond ETF X containing 1/3 bonds A, B, C each.

Q1. Does the bond ETF X pay out the coupons from each of A, B and C to me? Hence that's one source of my profit from holding X?

Q2. Since X is traded on the market, I'm susceptible to price fluctuation risk in X (for example due to changing government interest rates, or even just supply-demand of X). But my potential profit should still be lower bounded somehow by the principal that's paid back when A, B, C expire and the face value I paid for X?

Q3. The point of asking Q1 and Q2 is I want to know, at the time of purchasing X, after e.g 1 year of holding X, what will be my range of possible profit? E.g. 2.5% to 3.5%? Or - 10% to +10%?

Assume no issuer defaults/fails to pay back principals on the bonds in the ETF.

This seems like a complicated calculation, I'd really appreciate links to resources understanding this!",2024-02-14,0
1060,Sony cuts PlayStation 5 sales forecast to 21 million units after posting record revenue,464,1aqlc02,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1aqlc02/sony_cuts_playstation_5_sales_forecast_to_21/,129,"Sony cut its sales forecast for its flagship PlayStation 5 console on Wednesday, after warning of weaker transactions in its key gaming division.

The Japanese gaming giant said it now expects to sell 21 million units of the PS5 in the fiscal year ending March, down from a previous forecast of 25 million units.

The cut in outlook comes after Sony posted record quarterly revenue in the all-important December quarter which encompasses the holiday season. Sony sold 8.2 million units of its flagship PlayStation 5 console in its fiscal third quarter, which runs from October to December. Sony has sold 16.4 million PS5 units so far in its fiscal year.

Sony also trimmed its fiscal year sales forecast for the gaming division by 210 billion yen to 4.15 trillion yen, saying it expects a decrease in sales of hardware.

The company‚Äôs challenge now lies in trying to keep up momentum for the PS5, which was released more than three years ago. In October, Sony made available a refreshed version of the console with better specs.

Rival Nintendo has been grappling with a similar issue, managing to keep interest in its near seven-year old Switch console thanks to new game releases and movies associated with its famous characters, like Super Mario.

Sales at Sony‚Äôs gaming business rose 16% year-on-year to 1.4 trillion yen in the December quarter, the company said on Wednesday. However, operating profit fell 26% in the division, due to increase losses from hardware due to promotions in the period as well as a decline in sales of first-party games.

Sony also lowered its sales forecast for the entire company to 12.3 trillion yen from 12.4 trillion yen for the fiscal year.

Sony beat analyst expectations by a wide margin in its fiscal third quarter when it reported results on Wednesday.

Here‚Äôs how Sony did in the December quarter versus LSEG consensus estimates:

Revenue: 3.75 trillion Japanese yen ($24.9 billion) versus 3.58 trillion yen expected

Operating profit: 463.3 billion yen versus 428.4 billion yen expected

Sony said that it will partially spin off its financial services business via a public listing. The company plans to distribute slightly more than 80% of its shares of Sony Financial Group through dividends in kind as a result of the spinoff, in a listing due to take place in October 2025.

Sony‚Äôs financial services unit saw revenue in the December quarter rise more than 1,100% to 311.7 billion yen. The company said this was thanks to a rise in sales at its insurance business.

Sony also reported a 21% jump in sales in its image sensor business, which it sells to companies like Apple for smartphones.

Meanwhile, Sony in January scrapped a planned merger with Indian firm Zee Entertainment. The deal, which was negotiated for more than two years, was seen as a way for Sony to get a foot into the lucrative Indian entertainment market.

Hiroki Totoki, Sony‚Äôs chief financial officer, said on Wednesday that India has ‚Äúgreat growth potential,‚Äù adding that the company will ‚Äúseek various opportunities‚Äù in the country and will look into plans to ‚Äúreplace‚Äù the failed merger with Zee.

From my perspective the market will keep running, earnings strength has been great overall and this last inflation print is not that bad, next I would like to share my views on some industries and my forecast for the future,  feel free to argue in the comment section.

**ENERGY (OIL) :**

Okay, lets start with the energy market, volatility has been large since 2020, great profits have been made since then. Global mayhem on oil and gas producing countries has generated great buying opportunities on futures, and companies of the sector in general have grown largely in profits, still the market has been very wary in pricing them for several reasons, but mainly because of over the board positive predictions on switching the economy towards green energy. During the economic boom of the last decade this could be seen as possible, but the switch is cost heavy and the money right now is not there. As off right now crude oil is on the rise, the march 2024 contract goes for 77.83$ during the last month it has risen 7%, tensions in the middle east are high and it can cause a sharp rise in prices, I would not be surprised if it reaches 90$ in the recent future.

Personally im positive on the oil market and currently hold positions in Petrobras (PBR) and Chevron (CVX) recent earnings on both companies have been great, currently I don‚Äôt plan in selling those positions.

&#x200B;

**TECH:**

&#x200B;

The TECH ride has been wild for the last few months, micro chips companies have been rising with a strength that has yet to be broken, NVDA leads the rise 64% positive in the last 6 months, but id like to remark the META Phoenix rising to beat the shit out of any bear that dared shorting it.

Personally I have mostly sold out of the large names of the sector already fearing they might be a bit overbought, but still hold two highly speculative positions. SoFi which I acquired pretty recently and RKLB which I have been holding for a while now. Sincerely I like both of the businesses, but they are stupidly speculative and if anything goes wrong they dump heavily as any small stock would.

&#x200B;

**BANKING AND FINANCE:**

&#x200B;

Today we got smacked down in this sector, I sincerely don't care for the CPI print, rates will inevitably come down, and when this happens the banking sector will boom, I was great at timing the top of the interest rate hike and at that time bought into Citigroup ( C ),  BANK OF AMERICA ( BAC ) and TLT ( ETF for treasury bonds with maturity over 20 years) .

My outlook for the sector is good, Bonds will get great capital gains as interest rates come down, specially longer durations which where severely punished during the banking Schism of 2022-2023, I will probably mantain those 3 positions for a few years until rates drop low enough.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**PHARMA:**

&#x200B;

The dear child of 2020 has been dropped from the top of the skyrise, the patent cliff is coming for companies like pfizer and the sector in general seems to have no bottom, personally I don't own anything here, but if Mr Market keeps beating the shit out of the sector it will inevitably generate good opportunities.

&#x200B;

**Media/Streamers:**

&#x200B;

Controversial and Volatile sector to say the least, somehow Netflix seems to be winning the streamer wars (for some reason everyone is addicted to Suits 4 years later. Go figure) behind Netflix we have Disney coming out of heavy losses from 2023, but still in the race and a bit further behind we get WBD and PARA that are just trying to survive at this point. As long as the consumer remains strong PARA and WBD might be able to keep their heads out of the water.

Personally im holding WBD for about a year and a half now, it has not really done anything, some times im up, some times im down. At the moment it just seemed like a great value play that had been beaten a bit too much by the market to pass up. Hell, it still looks like it to me, but im definitely biased.

Still, outside of DC their movies last year where great and their gaming sector is growing pretty fucking fast. MAX numbers are a bit disappointing since they have published award winning series behind one another but still have managed to get marginal growth. For me, the value there is still there for the taking, but thread with caution, debt levels are still not nice at all.

&#x200B;

**CONCLUSIONS:**

&#x200B;

Well, those are my views for today, I sincerely think there is no reason for the market to correct sharply , but we should be wary of some drunk valuations being thrown around by Mr Market. What is your outlook on the industries I mentioned above? And where do you think we will find the market 6 months from now?",2024-02-13,0

The stock jumped more than 8% in extended trading.

Here‚Äôs how the company did:

EPS: 55-cent loss. It‚Äôs not immediately clear if that‚Äôs comparable to the 62-cent profit estimate, according to LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv

Revenue: $2.22 billion vs. $2.17 billion expected by analysts, according to LSEG

Revenue climbed 17% from $1.9 billion in the same quarter a year earlier. Airbnb posted adjusted earnings of $738 million in the fourth quarter. Analysts were expecting $645 million, according to StreetAccount.

Airbnb reported a net loss of $349 million, or 55 cents a share, compared to net income of $319 million, or 48 cents per share, a year earlier. The company said its loss included lodging tax reserves and non-recurring tax withholding expenses of around $1 billion.

In its shareholder letter, Airbnb said the company is at an ‚Äúinflection point‚Äù after spending the last three years upgrading and adding features to its main room-sharing service. Airbnb said it‚Äôs investing in more under-penetrated markets abroad in 2024, and that it will share plans to expand beyond its core business later this year.

Airbnb said revenue in the first quarter will be between $2.03 billion and $2.07 billion, while Wall Street was expecting $2.03 billion, according to LSEG. The company said the quarter started out strong, with more than 6 million guests celebrating the new year in an Airbnb.

Gross booking value, which Airbnb uses to track host earnings, service fees, cleaning fees and taxes, came in at $15.5 billion in the fourth quarter. The company reported 98.8 million nights and experiences booked, up 12% from a year ago, and above the 98 million expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.

Airbnb said guest demand ‚Äúremains strong,‚Äù particularly for first-time users. The company said that after the ‚Äúvolatility‚Äù impacted the business in October, when the Israel-Hamas war broke out, its nights booked growth accelerated through the rest of the period.

Average daily rates increased by 3% from a year ago to $157 in the fourth quarter, and the company ended 2023 with 7.7 million active listings, up 18% from a year earlier.

Airbnb said in the investor letter that it has seen ‚Äúdouble-digit supply growth‚Äù in active listings across every region, while the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions grew the most.

The news came as the company reported fourth-quarter earnings that fell roughly in line with analysts‚Äô revenue estimates.

Shares of the company fell 5% in extended trading.

The layoffs are focused in part on middle management and creating a flatter organizational structure, according to Instacart, as well as focusing teams on larger projects, such as advertising efforts on Roku, Google Ads and more.

Three top executives are also departing the company for personal reasons, according to Instacart: COO Asha Sharma, CTO Varouj Chitilian and chief architect JJ Zhuang. Instacart will only backfill the CTO role.

The company posted fourth-quarter revenue of $803 million, roughly in line with the $804 million that Wall Street expected, according to analyst estimates from LSEG, formerly Refinitiv.

In September, Instacart went public in one of the first significant venture-backed tech IPOs since December 2021. In its prospectus, the company said it would focus on incorporating artificial intelligence and machine learning features into the platform, and that it expected to rely on those features to ‚Äúdrive future growth in our business.‚Äù

Instacart shoppers and drivers deliver goods in over 5,500 cities from more than 40,000 grocers and other stores, according to its website. The business took off during the Covid-19 pandemic as consumers avoided public places. But profitability has always been a significant challenge, as it can be with much of the gig economy, because of high costs associated with contractor payouts.

Paramount will lay off about 800 people, or an estimated 3% of its workforce, according to a person familiar with the matter. Paramount Global ended 2022 with about 24,500 full-time and part-time employees.

Affected workers will be notified Tuesday, Bakish said in the note.

‚ÄúThese adjustments will help enable us to build on our momentum and execute our strategic vision for the year ahead ‚Äì and I firmly believe we have much to be excited about,‚Äù Bakish wrote in the note.

Deadline first reported the number of cuts last month.

Paramount Global owns a variety of assets including CBS, Paramount Pictures, Pluto TV, Paramount+ and cable networks including Nickelodeon, BET and Comedy Central. The job cuts come as the media company considers merger and acquisition options. Paramount Global has held early merger talks with Skydance Media and Warner Bros. Discovery in recent months, CNBC has previously reported.

The media company had warned employees of impending cuts in an internal memo last month. Bakish said at the time that Paramount Global needed to ‚Äúoperate as a leaner company and spend less.‚Äù

Its Paramount+ streaming service continues to lose money each quarter. The platform lost $238 million in the third quarter. The company reports fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 28.

Super Bowl LVIII on CBS was the most-watched television show in history, with an estimated 123.4 million people having watched across all platforms.

CBS charged a record high average $6.5 million for every 30-second advertisement for the Super Bowl according to the research company Guideline.

The network earned tens of millions in additional revenue because the game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers went to overtime.

Earnings per share: 49 cents adjusted vs. 49 cents expected

Revenue: $10.85 billion vs. $10.68 billion expected

Shares of the company rose less than 1% in premarket trading.

Coke reported fourth-quarter net income of $1.97 billion, or 46 cents per share, down from $2.03 billion, or 47 cents per share, a year earlier.

Excluding items, the company earned 49 cents per share.

Net sales rose 7% to $10.85 billion. Coke‚Äôs organic revenue, which strips out acquisitions and divestitures, climbed 12% in the quarter.

Coke reported unit case volume growth of 2% for the quarter. The metric excludes pricing and foreign currency.

However, North American volume shrank 1%, as demand for Coke‚Äôs water, sports drinks, coffee and tea fell. For comparison, rival PepsiCo saw volume for its North American beverage unit fall 6% in the fourth quarter. Pepsi executives said high borrowing costs and lower personal savings squeezed consumers‚Äô budgets, leading shoppers to seek out private label options or smaller pack sizes.

For 2024, Coke is forecasting organic revenue growth of 6% to 7% and an increase in comparable earnings per share of 4% to 5%. The company expects that foreign exchange rates will weigh on both its earnings and revenue for the full year.

Looking to the first quarter, Coke is anticipating a 4% headwind from currency exchange rates on its comparable revenue. The company also expects foreign exchange to slow its earnings per share growth, and anticipates an 8% hit from currency changes during the period.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

   * Iovance had $427.8 million in cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash at September 30, 2023, compared to $478.3 million at December 31, 2022. The current cash position and anticipated revenue in 2024 from lifileucel and Proleukin¬Æ is expected to be sufficient to fund current and planned operations into 2025.

* **2024 Outlook**
   * FDA Priority Review of Biologics License Application (BLA) on Track for Lifileucel in Advanced Melanoma with Prescription Drug User Fee Act Action (PDUFA) Date of February 24, 2024
   * Positive Regulatory Feedback Supports Lifileucel Regulatory Submissions in Europe and Canada in 2024
   * A look at their career section, implies all wheel are in motion. If approved of course.
* **Additional**
   * TIL therapies include IOV-GM1-201 to investigate PD-1 inactivated TIL therapy (IOV-4001) in previously treated advanced melanoma or NSCLC as well as pivotal Cohort 2 in the ongoing C-145-04 trial of lifileucel to support a BLA in cervical cancer following progression on or after chemotherapy and pembrolizumab.
   * A novel interleukin-2 (IL-2) analog (IOV-3001) is in Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies supporting its use as part of the TIL treatment regimen following TIL infusion.  

   * Additional research and preclinical studies are exploring approaches to increase TIL potency using CD39/69 double negative TILs and stable gene incorporation enhancements such as tethered cytokines.
* **Typical Bio setback**
   * On Dec 22, 2023, the FDA placed a clinical hold on the IOV-LUN-202 study following a grade 5 (fatal) serious adverse effect, potentially related to the non-myeloablative lymphodepletion pre-conditioning regimen observed in the study.
      * Nuance:  What is reported but  under-reported, is the patient being very ill already and could not be helped by regular treatments. Articles from sites that deliver analysis almost always ignore this. The trial is halted, which the FDA is morally and ethically obliged to do. But, my guess,  it will continue. 
* **Concluding**
   * Getting its melanoma program approved would be huge, as it'd mark THE FIRST APPROVAL of a cell therapy for a solid tumor indication. The company would start to make sales for the first time, and it might even be profitable by early 2025.  
  
If approved, history is made. As to the effect on the stock, over time....

In the past, the Fed cuts rates when the job market or economic growth is constrained. Lately, the reasoning for ensuing rate cuts seems to be ‚Äúbecause they can‚Äù. And the Fed in the FOMC notes and in JPow's subsequent release commentary seems to corroborate this. He noted multiple times that they are waiting for ""more, consistent data points"" referring to continued low inflation numbers, before cutting rates.

This doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. Everything I‚Äôve ever learned about macroeconomic theory and the Fed‚Äôs levers note that the fed will increase its rate in times of high inflation and decrease its rate when the market needs an artificial economic boost. But if the Fed continues to nail this ‚Äúsoft landing‚Äù the market does not need a boost.

I must be missing something:

Is the macro economic market truly worse than jobs numbers indicate?

Are there longer term risks that are being assumed regarding future macro economic conditions that will most certainly come into play if rates stay high?



The fed has even produced internal directives in the last 5 years declaring that they wanted to work to get to average of 2% inflation while maintaining higher normal rates so there can be more room to cut rates in case of economic weakness.

Why do they seem to be heading towards deviation from this logic? Everyone on the street seems to think the fed is justified in cutting rates and it seems even the fed agrees. But to me it just seems careless and would be an uncharacteristically short-sighted move for this Fed Committee to execute while there‚Äôs no economic reason to justify lowering rates.",2024-02-12,0

For simple math, let's assume you bought $1M of new issue with the below assumptions:

-fixed 2.5% average inflation rate for the next 12 months
-Fed starts interest rate decreases in the second half off the year
-You hold for 1 year, and then sell when the current TIPS rate is back to 1%. You don't have to look back far to see it return to 1%, especially once the fed starts cutting it will drop quickly.

Given all these assumptions, You'd have the below returns from this investment after 1 year.
-With a drop in yield of 0.95% after 1 year, the premium increase (capital gain) with 9 years left in duration would be $1M x 9 x 0.0095 = $85,500.
- With a yield of 1.95%, the interest income would be $19,500.
- The inflation adjusted principal assuming 2.5% inflation would be $1,025,000, or an appreciation of $25,000.

My question is: If the majority of growth in an index that is supposed to represent the broader performance of the market is localized to the tech sector, is it still a safe(r) more reliable investment than individual stock picks in the tech sector? 

Will we see a market correction eventually as small and midsized cap companies aren't performing nearly as well as they are being portrayed? I just see everyone talking about hitting 5k for the first time but I'm like can we really consider this still an effective tool at measuring the broader performance of the market if 6/7 companies account for a min of 25% of total cap. I mean shouldn't we be normalizing the growth to reflect this? I thought the whole point was to measure the performance/health of 500 companies not 30 or less like the dow.

I guess the crux of my question is can we really say that investing in index funds like VOO or VTI is safe(r) or as safe of a bet as it used to be 20/30 years ago? What happens if one of the mag 6/7 goes down? We can't expect the US to continue trade tariff policies and funding/engaging in armed conflicts just to keep a company above foreign competition.

Edited to add: 

some of the comments have acknowledged the near-term risk, which is what I was getting at. I apologize for my question being poorly worded. I know that long term it is safe, but near term (next 1-3 years), am I making a better decision going with individual large cap tech stocks, and then once small and midsized caps start growing again selling and then re-investing in index funds, or spreading out my risk in an index funds now. I know this is all based on personal risk tolerance but I'm just looking to see how others are feeling 

*ATM= at the moment*

Second edit: I was corrected in that the SP500 is solely large cap. And that what I am really talking about is mega cap vs large cap. If I knew how to cross out text on mobile, I would correct it. But still my question remains, how can we include the performance statistics of stocks that are so far removed from the rest of the companies in the SP500? Are we putting too much emphasis on the growth of less than 10 companies when we are talking about the overall ""health of the economy"" ?(SP400 and SP600 are mid and small caps, respectively) 

Third edit: I was reminded that I should state my retirement timeline. At the earliest I'm saying 30 years conservatively (maybe 25 if im really lucky with investments and/or never have children) and 40 at the latest. I would also like to thank everyone for their advice on this as I have realized that I am letting past negative events cloud my judgement too much and that I am probably being impatient and I should just make continual investments in the market every month. And with looking at 20/30yr trends the market has always gone up so even if I had the absolute worst timing if I just keep investing in solid companies/funds by the time I reach retirement I will be set.",2024-02-12,0

First off, their main lines of revenue are going to come from two areas. In the short term, sending other companies satellites to orbit. In the long term, sending their own satellites to orbit. 

I think their short term revenue stream will be successful. They have many missions lined up with multiple companies and NASA. Having your own satellite constellation is the new cool thing to do! There is money to be made there. But I am not sure how long that will last. Peter Beck seems to have similar concerns. 

Beck has said in multiple interviews that the most successful space companies will be vertically integrated and capable of launching their own satellites and it will be critical for Rocket Lab to have their own constellation to be successful. However, he has yet to announce what service their constellation will provide. 

This is where my major concerns lay. Ultimately the most successful constellation is going to be one that provides internet. In my opinion, I don‚Äôt think Rocket Lab will have the capital to make this happen. 

Transitioning from launching other companies satellites to focusing on launching their own satellites is going be to be nearly impossible for a public company to pull off. The amount of capital this takes is profound, and I don‚Äôt think they will have enough cash on hand just from launching other companies satellites. 

Space X is in the process of creating their own internet constellation now, Starlink, and had to sink over 50 billion dollars into it before it became profitable. Rocket Lab will not have the first mover advantage like space X, and therefore will have to sink even more money into it before their constellation becomes profitable.

Rocket Lab may be profitable in the near term, but I do not see them successfully creating their own constellation that ultimately will need to compete with Starlink.

1109,Passive investing bubble brought to you in part by ETF‚Äôs,90,1anzzma,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1anzzma/passive_investing_bubble_brought_to_you_in_part/,59,"So you know how in most of the melt up‚Äôs/meltdowns there‚Äôs usually a product that‚Äôs largely responsible? 
Usually no one can see it coming, in 2007/8 it was overlevering bad loans through CDO‚Äôs.

Today I was trying to track where the volume was coming from on one of my stocks. I found a declaration of 5% ownership by Blackrock in the SEC filings. So this pointed me towards their Ishares line of ETF‚Äôs. These ‚Äúmodified market cap weighted‚Äù ETF‚Äôs seem to forget the market cap weighted in favour of the modified part. 

Money is being channeled by Vangaurd, Blackrock Etc‚Ä¶ into a select few ‚Äúunicorns‚Äù. I believe that‚Äôs why there‚Äôs no breadth in rallies, the passive investing money hose is selectively focused. 

The investing mandates are created when the ETF‚Äôs are established, so all that‚Äôs left to do is rebalance. What results from this? The investment mandate might make sense at the time, all of this passive investing pushes the price to levels where the fundamentals don‚Äôt quite make sense anymore. The fund managers don‚Äôt give a shit, and why would they? It‚Äôs not their money and the more they have under management the more they‚Äôre earning in management fees. The folks supplying the money are too far removed from the investing to see what‚Äôs happening. They buy these ‚Äúdiversified ETF‚Äôs‚Äù that are professionally rebalanced and diversified with the premise of releasing control to the experts.

Here‚Äôs an example: why are AMD and NVIDIA almost equally weighted in the SOXX ETF given that NVIDIA is roughly 6x the size of AMD? They should be weighted proportional to their market caps. When fund managers place this metaphorical finger on the scale it creates buying pressure. ETF‚Äôs are enabling market makers to use other people‚Äôs money to move the markets. This can snowball as the companies that are given a larger allocation in the semi-actively managed ETF‚Äôs gain a larger market cap. As the companies market cap becomes a larger portion of the index the passively managed ETF‚Äôs begin allocating a larger percent to the company and so on‚Ä¶

I would also hypothesize that more young people are turning to the markets to get ahead more than ever. Let‚Äôs face it, the rich housing markets seem out of reach for a lot of people these days. Higher interest rates perpetuate this further. I would be curious to know how many of you also see the equity markets as your means to get ahead in the midst of unaffordable real estate.

What are your thoughts on this? Poke holes in my ideas if you see flaws. Add to the idea if there‚Äôs another angle that you see in this line of thought.

I‚Äôm fairly convinced that we‚Äôre going to see a meltdown. CRE will likely be one of the catalysts. Office space is very difficult to convert to residential. The logistics of plumbing additional bathrooms, space planning, fixturing appliances etc‚Ä¶ make it very expensive.

 I'm looking for some help with Stop limit Sell orders. 

I'm trading on Sofi and they do not offer a Stop Loss when selling shares. Would setting up a Stop Limit with a low limit value be basically the same thing? I am looking to protect myself from a possible large drop in value and limit my losses to 5%.

I know a Stop Loss will turn into a market order and sell at the Market price when the target is hit. Typically I would set the Stop Loss at -5% of the stock value and be done.

From what I understand for the Stop Limit, when the stop target is hit, the limit order will activate as long as it's above the limit price. Does that mean if I set the limit really low will it basically trigger at the market price? For instance if I set the stop at -5% the value of the stock and the limit at -50% the value of the stock. Are there any downsides to doing this?

I appreciate any thoughts anyone has on this.

1112,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) $171 A good long term buy,249,1anrsxh,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1anrsxh/advanced_micro_devices_amd_171_a_good_long_term/,126,"\#AMD‚Äôs MI300 chips will be its growth engine for the future and the key reason for buying this stock. While I don‚Äôt believe it will get close to Nvidia‚Äôs near monopolistic market share of 80% there is ample room for more competitors and AMD will benefit from the AI boom as well.  
It recently upped its guidance for 2024 for artificial intelligence-related revenue to $3.5B up from $2B previously.

$AMD Chief Executive Dr. Lisa Su said she had ""good confidence"" the company will be able to exceed the $3.5B figure this year and the $1.5B run-rate for the coming fourth-quarter. $1.5Bn run rate implies $6Bn in annual sales.  
However, based on Citi analyst estimates, AMD is likely to generate $5B this year and $8B next year from the MI300 - they believe that Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) are the largest customers for the MI300, which was unveiled in December to much fanfare. And with the average selling price at roughly $10,000 for Microsoft and $15,000 or more for other customers, it's possible AMD is purposefully underestimating sales figures, possibly on supply concerns?  
For Q4-2023 AMD results were in line with expectations  
EPS: $0.77 per share, adjusted, versus $0.77 per share expected  
Revenue: $6.17 billion, versus $6.12 billion expected  
Data Center revenue $2.28Bn in line V $2.29 expected.  
Guidance was light:  
Q1-24 $5.4Bn in sales, plus or minus $300 million, V $5.73 Bn expected.  
Flat data center revenue with server chip declines to be offset by AI GPU sales. We saw weak data center revenue from Intel, this is definitely some cannibalization and likely to continue, till AI GPU starts taking a larger share of the pie.  
Client Group - The recovery in PC‚Äôs helped AMD‚Äôs client group, which rose 62% year-over-year to $1.46 billion in sales, which the company said was boosted by recent chip launches.  
Gaming, which includes ‚Äúsemi-custom‚Äù processors for Microsoft Xbox and Sony Playstation consoles, fell 17%. AMD blamed slower console sales, and said it expected semi-custom revenue to decline by a ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù double-digit percentage in the current quarter.

Google Cloud is continuing to close this growth rate gap with Azure, and may surpass Azure leveraging AI.

1114,"Purely in theory, why would anyone ever buy a stock that doesn't pay dividends (in a perfect market)?",0,1anmhm4,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1anmhm4/purely_in_theory_why_would_anyone_ever_buy_a/,217,"*Disclaimer: I am quite new to investing/trading and just recently learned about how to value a company and P/E and DCF and so on, so this question may be very stupid.*

So the reason one buys a stock, ignoring voting rights and other such immaterial gains, is because one expects a return on the investment that in a couple years will be higher than the initial investment.

For a dividend stock this is very easy: say the stock has a P/E of 10, so you pay 10$ today for 1$ of todays earnings. So to keep it simple, we assume the company's cashflow is the same as the earnings and the dividends are the same as the cashflow and that there is no growth, your investment will have paid off in 10 years just through dividends.

Now add to that the fact that you usually choose a company that grows in earnings and the fact that you can sell this stock to someone else at a higher price and suddenly your investment will pay off much sooner.

But now take a stock where the company has publicly stated that they will never pay a dividend, such as ACM Research when I was going through one of their SEC filings. In this case no matter if you hold the stock for 1 day or 100 years, no matter if the company's earnings double every year, you will never see a cent of it. In fact, your investment will have lost money through inflation and cost of opportunity.

So why then do people buy these stocks? To sell them to someone else later. Okay. But why do those other ones buy the stock then? To sell them to someone else later. Okay, but... - you get the point? To me it seems like the greater fool theory at work. You always count on there being another fool to buy the stock off of you.

But if this were a perfect market (it's not) where everyone collectively agrees that non-dividend stocks have no value because they won't ever give you a single cent in returns, then nobody would ever buy such a stock off of you, and the stock's price would collapse. It doesn't matter then how much the company may grow in valuation because nobody will ever see a cent from it.

Now this doesn't apply if you count on the company paying dividends in the future after the growth phase, or it doing a share buyback or such things. But that is why I took the example of a company that has stated that it will never do such a thing, such as ACM Research.

So then, why would anyone ever buy such a stock in a perfect market? What am I missing here?

**EDIT: Alot of people don't seem to get that my question is purely theoretical in nature assuming a perfect market. I get that in real-life thongs work differently. That is why I have several non-dividend paying stocks on my watchlist, including the aforementioned one.**

**But I have also been told that shareholders if they have enough voting power can overrule a company's management and successfully demand the payment of dividends. So in that case then that answers the question even in a perfect market.**

**EDIT2:**

**Another excellent point on why people would buy such a stock even in a perfect market:**

> You need to understand that if you own 100% of stocks then you own the full company. If the company is profitable, there will be people interested in owning it, willing to pay a good price for the stock, pushing the price higher. The more profitable the company is, the more people will be interested in owning the company or at least some part of it. If you buy a stock then at some point someone will want to buy it from you because they will want to get their voting rights from 40% to 60%, something like that

**I think my question has been sufficiently answered then. Thank you.**

**EDIT3:**

**Another reason:**

> The one caveat to this would be the potential for a buy-out. Some small companies don't pay dividends, but are likely to be bought out at some point by a larger company for a price that will be returned to shareholders in cash or new equity.

EDIT4: (last one lol)

You can do your own research, consult a trusted financial advisor, or do whatever it is you think makes the most investing sense. What you shouldn't do is blindly follow me. I am not a financial advisor. I am an amateur investor, and any positive past performance I have enjoyed is not a guarantee of future success. All investments carry the risk of loss. This post discusses a particularly risky investment, which will probably not fit with the risk tolerance and goals of all investors.

Additional Important Disclaimer:  I am an attorney.  Unless you have hired me, unrelated to this post, I am not your attorney. This post is not legal advice to you.  It does not create an attorney-client relationship between us.  

My Background:  I have been licensed to practice law for over 15 years.  In that time, I have handled a wide array of cases.  I do not specialize in anything.  That means, specifically, as it applies to this case, I am not a specialist in antitrust law and  I am not a specialist in federal appeals. I do have some federal appellate experience, but it is not in the 1st circuit, the court which is hearing this appeal.  Analyzing antitrust cases interests me, and it is my belief that the skills I have developed over a decade and a half as an attorney, and of course through my studies in law school, likely give me a better ability to analyze the merits of an appeal than a lay-person.  Nevertheless I am not thoroughly researching and writing a brief.  I am not your counsel, and I am not guaranteeing any particular result.  I am putting some thoughts out there that people can consider, but because I am not thoroughly researching and citing every single statement, it is probable that I will misstate or overlook some things.  What I miss could be important.  Do not read this, rely on it, and make an investment decision based on that.  It is my thoughts and musings, and kind of an explanation of why I did what I did. I am not telling you to do the same.

Background on related post:  I made this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/17lit6s/the\_arbitrage\_case\_for\_spirit\_airlines/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/17lit6s/the_arbitrage_case_for_spirit_airlines/)

In that post, I thought that this deal was about 70% to go through.  I am less sure now, although I am still leaning toward it being completed.  This is primarily due to timeline concerns.

THE ANALYSIS

Background:  Spirit and JetBlue signed a merger agreement.  The DoJ sued to Block the deal.  At trial, the DoJ prevailed, resulting in an order by Judge Young blocking the merger.  JetBlue and Spirit appealed that decision to the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals.  Oral Argument is expected in June.  The current deal price, were it to go through, is $29.85/share.  Additionally, JetBlue pays Spirit shareholders $0.10/month for each share held.  If the deal is not completed by July (I believe 24th), either party can walk away.  If the deal is not consummated, JetBlue must pay Spirit $70 million.  There was a termination fee to be paid to Spirit shareholders as well, but the $0.10/share was being deducted from that particular fee, and it is now $0. $SAVE is currently trading in the $6-$7 range, indicating that the market views the merger as extremely unlikely to succeed.

The currently dominant view expressed in media coverage is that JetBlue and Spirit, who I will refer to as Appellants, have an extremely low chance of success on appeal.  Generally, the media people whom I see expressing this view are not attorneys.  I think of them as lay-people, but they may well have some expertise in finance, etc.  Nevertheless, when they start handicapping legal cases, I can't help but think they're in the wrong wheelhouse.  I am often surprised by just how terrible coverage of legal cases in the media can be.

Here are the main reasons that I think that Judge Young's opinion is likely to be reversed.  I expect, but do not guarantee, that these arguments will be made in the brief of Appellants, which we will see within a couple weeks, albeit, not necessarily in the same order.  They might think of something I missed.  They probably will.  They have a team of attorneys working together on this as their job.  I am doing this alone in my spare time.  It isn't the same.  Now I just want to point out, before I begin, that while I am picking apart Judge Young's opinion, I respect his many years of service on the bench, and this is in no way intended to besmirch him.  Attorneys disagree with each other constantly, and that in no way diminishes either side of a debate.

List of issues (described in greater detail below):

A)  The Court chose the wrong geographic market

B) The Court failed to properly apply the doctrine of estoppel

C) The Court stated but failed to apply the correct legal standard (substantially lessen competition in any relevant market).

D) The Court failed to identify a particular market in which competition was substantially lessened, and failed to conduct the required market specific analysis in that market.

E) The Court inappropriately assigned the burden of persuasion to Appellants, where it should have been assigned to Appellees.

F) The Appellees (DOJ & States) failed to introduce sufficient evidence such that a reasonable fact-finder could determine that they have established a substantial lessening of competition in any relevant market.

G) The Court arguably failed to sufficiently weigh the nationwide consumer benefits of the deal.

Ok, now i'm going to dig into the meat of these a little bit.  This is not a legal brief, so there will be cursory and incomplete explanations.  Otherwise, this would be a great many pages long.

A)  The Court chose the wrong geographic market

I submit that the appropriate market was national.  The Court defined the market as city pairs.  The argument used for this is essentially that if I am flying from (for example) Dallas to Fort Lauderdale, and my ticket price goes up, I am not really helped if this is offset by cheaper ticket prices from, say, Oakland to Harrisburg.  Facially, from a lay-person perspective, this is a really compelling argument.  Legally, it is not as cut and dried, however.  When analyzing the relevant market, it is important not only to consider the mobility of consumers, but also the mobility of competitors.  Where you have low barriers to entry and a highly mobile product, it is nearly impossible to successfully monopolize.  This is because if I substantially raise prices, a competitor can just move in and compete.  The airline industry is highly mobile.  Planes (and I know this is shocking) move around.  It is not hard to get slots in most of the airports in which Spirit and JetBlue both operate, and they have made divestitures in the hardest to enter airports, all to make sure that they fall into this category where competition can move in easily, so there is not a specific monopoly concern.  Because we all know airlines shift routes frequently and easily, and because that was established, and because they also compete with each other nationally, I would argue the national market is the appropriate market.  This is a fact specific inquiry, and reasonable minds can differ, but the DoJ was arguing at the same time that the markets were city pairs and that the harm was national in scope, and that just makes no sense whatsoever.  Historically, there have been cases where courts have determined that the appropriate market was national.  I am not aware of any cases where they have determined city pairs were the appropriate geographic markets in the context of an actual airline merger.  They did use them in the NEA case, which was not an actual merger, but in that case the parties agreed to that market definition.  There could be some cases out there that I am not aware of.  If the Circuit Court rules that the appropriate market is National, then it is exceedingly difficult to find any path where this merger is monopolistic, because the big 4 airlines each control, and would control after the merger, a far bigger share of the national market than JetBlue+Spirit.

B) The Court failed to properly apply the doctrine of estoppel

There was a motion to rule that the DoJ be estopped from asserting certain arguments, and that certain statements which they previously made be ""deemed admitted"".  (Here comes a very basic explanation, because there are actually many types of estoppel and similar other doctrines). Basically, the idea is, if you make an argument in a case, and the court agrees with you, and it is essential to the court's ruling, and the court rules in your favor, then you have to accept that argument as the truth when you come back into court again.  You don't get to argue the opposite side of it, because you argued that thing, and you won.  In the NEA case, the government made a whole bunch of statements, about how JetBlue was a Maverick, a unique competitor, the only company that could effectively compete with the Big 4 airlines, etc.  Appellants wanted them to be stuck with those arguments.  The court never decided this issue anywhere that I saw in the case... it just kind of seemed to not rule on it.  Some of the government's experts seemingly contradicted these statements, and wouldn't say that their analysis would hold up if those statements were true.  I will point out, trying to use estoppel against the government is a bit more tricky than using it against a private litigant.  I think it should have applied here, but there are certainly counterarguments and reasonable legal minds may disagree on this.  If I am correct, however, and the Circuit Court rules that the government was estopped from making some of its core arguments, and that some of its expert's testimony was inadmissible because it makes prohibited arguments, that strikes at the very heart of the government's case, and makes it difficult to see how they could prevail.

C) The Court stated but failed to apply the correct legal standard (substantially lessen competition in any relevant market).

To be enjoined, a court is supposed to find that it ""may result in a substantial lessening of competition in any relevant market"" - That's pretty right but I am in a groove of typing so I'm not looking it up.  Anyway... there are a few words that are key here ""May"" ""Substantial"" ""Lessening of Competition"" ""Relevant market"".  We already talked about picking a market, but we'll delve into what that means a bit soon..  May, serves to lower the threshold from something like ""will"", for example, but does not lower it to the point of ""might under any circumstances you could ever think of"".  It becomes something along the lines of, could foreseeably reasonably be expected to.  Not a super high standard.  ""Substantial""  takes us kind of to the heart of it.  It can't be a minor lessening of competition.  It has to be something with both duration and severity.  And then ""Lessening of Competition"". Now sometimes price is sometimes used as a proxy here, but really it is not exactly the same thing.  Like... if the cheapest store in town raises prices, that doesn't necessarily mean competition is lessened, if there are the same number of stores, for example.  It is important though, to recognize, that we are dealing with ""in any relevant market"" not ""in any relevant market segment"".  Here, the court defined a market geographically (city pairs) and product market (passenger air travel). I think the geographic market is wrong, as stated above, but lets just assume arguendo that we are using it on appeal. The judge then went on to say, this will harm the type of customer that flies spirit in this market, so this must be enjoined.  That is the wrong analysis.  You have to look at how it affects the whole market, not just spirit customers.  The Court explicitly asked if the DoJ was trying to define a market of cost conscious consumers, and DoJ said no.  Everyone agrees they are not the market, they are a part of it.  This seems pretty likely to be redone by the Circuit Court.  Now I am not saying (in this paragraph) what happens when the right legal standard gets applied properly.  I am just saying, you can't say, for example, my product market is all medical care, this merger hurts people getting knee replacements, so it must be enjoined.  You have to look at what it does to the whole market for medical care, or you've done it wrong, and the Circuit Court needs to redo it.

D) The Court failed to identify a particular market in which competition was substantially lessened, and failed to conduct the required market specific analysis in that market.

The Court opinion laid out what market it was using, and then said, basically, there's bound to be a problem in at least one of these city pairs.  That is, at least according to my understanding, insufficient analysis.  Someone may correct me if I am wrong, but my understanding is that a Court has to actually find a market with a problem, and analyze that market, and explain why they find that the merger may substantially lessen competition in that particular market, in order to enjoin the merger.  The Circuit Court would likely need to do this analysis de novo, since it literally wasn't done, to enjoin this merger.  There is a problem, however.  If this were the main problem in the case, the Circuit Court would be well within its rights to remand the case back down to the trial judge to do this analysis.  This could, if JetBlue and Spirit don't extend the deal, kill the merger just by running out the clock.  I believe that the Circuit Court will be cognizant of this situation, and understand that we are in a ""justice delayed is justice denied"" scenario, and not do that.  Nevertheless, there is risk there, because Courts do sometimes remand things for further consideration consistent with an opinion saying what they believe a trial judge failed to do. 

E) The Court inappropriately assigned the burden of persuasion to Appellants, where it should have been assigned to Appellees.

Around pages 105-106 of the opinion, the Court stated that Jetblue/Spirit cannot show that a customer will not see increased prices, so the merger must be enjoined (paraphrased).  Now a customer seeing increased prices is not the same thing as substantially lessened competition, as I said above, but that is not the only problem here.  It's the ""Jetblue/Spirit cannot show"".  So... these merger cases are very complicated, and you have burdens of production, which shift in a complex framework, and the burden of persuasion.  The burden of persuasion is with the party trying to block the merger.  It is the government's job to show that competition may be substantially lessened.  It is not JetBlue/Spirit's job to show affirmatively that competition will not be substantially lessened.  It's not the same, but this would be kind of like saying ""the defendant is unable to prove their innocence and is thus guilty.""  It misconstrues who is supposed to do what.  I am not sure that doing this particular analysis differently necessarily results in a different outcome, but it could, and it is a reason not to uphold this decision as written.

F) The Appellees (DOJ & States) failed to introduce sufficient evidence such that a reasonable fact-finder could determine that they have established a substantial lessening of competition in any relevant market.

Assuming, arguendo, that we are using city pairs as the relevant market, lets move forward.  The Judge stated, in his opinion, that the Appellees experts failed to include other airports from the same metropolitan area in their calculations.  This is hugely important.  Their numbers are wrong, like in a missing whole airports sort of way.  When you look at this case, and realize that Spirit tends to operate out of the secondary, less popular airport in most cities (because it is cheaper, has less wait times, etc.), that means that in most origin-destination pairs, we are actually ignoring the biggest airport and most of the air traffic that is supposed to be included in the calculations.  Without those numbers, it seems exceedingly difficult to make a case that the government's experts should be relied upon in showing that this merger will substantially lessen competition.

G) The Court arguably failed to sufficiently weigh the nationwide consumer benefits of the deal.

This one is a bit tricky.  If we assume, again, that we are adopting city pairs as the market, then we also assume, for the moment, that you've found some level of harm in some of those markets, and that viewed alone it would rise to the level of substantially lessening competition, but then you look further, and find that there are substantial gains (which the court found) nationally to competition from the merger, the question is, how do you weigh that.  The Appellants take the position that national benefit can offset regional harm, and the Appellees take the decision that it cannot.  I am not certain, but I think this is unsettled law in the 1st circuit.  If someone has a case either from the Supreme Court or the 1st circuit court of appeals which deals with this head on, I'd love to read it.  My current perspective, subject to being updated with any new information I haven't seen, is that this offset should be considered.  If we look at what is actually going on, and we say that this merger will let JetBlue compete much more effectively with the big 4 nationally, but still block the merger on the grounds of a particular city pair, that seems silly.  Almost any airlines that merge are going to have a substantial presence in the same city SOMEWHERE.  If this means that no airlines can merge, it effectively means nobody can ever effectively compete with the big 4, and we are entrenching that oligopoly in air travel forever.  That seems to be contrary to the intent of the Clayton Act.  I hate relying on policy arguments and I'd much rather have strong case law to point to.  There might be some out there I haven't seen, but I have not seen any for either side of this which is binding on the 1st circuit.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

There's a lot more detail that I could have put in above.  There's a lot more research I could have done too, so don't take everything I've said as certain.  My point is, what I look at when I see this case is a pretty strong appeal on all fronts, and what I see reported and reflected in the stock price is an infinitesimal chance of success, and the two don't seem to match.  Either the reporting and the market are wrong, or I am.  Keep in mind, it could be me.  I've bet heavily on this, but I am not an oracle, and there are no guarantees.

There are other reasons this deal could fail, beyond this appeal.  We are looking at a hearing in June, and it's possible we don't have a ruling by July 24.  I doubt it, but it's certainly possible.  DoT has its stuff on hold pending that decision.  I doubt DoT makes a final call by July 24.  JetBlue has said they'll waive that provision and move forward and fight the DoT in Court if necessary, but if the DoT refuses to provide a waiver to allow them to operate under common ownership pending resolution of the certificate issue, it certainly gives JetBlue an out to walk away if they decide they want one.  That is something I see as a risk to the deal.  

Spirit's financial situation in a no-deal scenario is not great.  It is substantially indebted and losing money fast.  It has mostly beat on expectations, but expectations have been bad. It needs to find a path back to profitability.  It's book value is substantially higher than its current market cap and it has substantial assets, substantial liquidity, and expectation of a pretty big settlement coming its way due to engine issues.  I think it is undervalued now, even in the no-deal scenario.  

At the moment, I'm still accumulating, because I think the market is overestimating the risk of bankruptcy and underestimating the prospects of a successful merger still happening, resulting in an undervaluation of the stock.  That doesn't mean you or anyone else should agree.  Do your own research, or hire professionals you trust to assist you, or do both.  Don't just go by what I said.  I'm someone whose Reddit post you read on the internet, who has told you a great many times that he might be wrong.

1121,People are sleeping on ESPN Bet $PENN,0,1an2tcj,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1an2tcj/people_are_sleeping_on_espn_bet_penn/,36,"(Previous post was deleted due to outside link.)

I believe that PENN is building a flywheel that will allow them to compete with DraftKings and FanDuel at the top of online sports betting in the US and Canada. The funds from their legacy casino business allow them to invest in the growth project of ESPN Bet, where they leverage the social reach, ecosystem, and integration of ESPN to make OSB mainstream.

**First, how are things trading (as of yesterday):**



|Company|PENN|DKNG|MGM|FLTR.L|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue - TTM|6.55B|3.29B|15.38B|9.11B|
|Gross Margin - TTM|2.71B (41%)|1.23B (37%)|7.35B (47%)|5.31B (58%)|
|EBITDA - TTM|0.98B (15%)|-0.86B (-26%)|3.64B (23%)|1.27B (14%)|
|Free Cash Flow - TTM|0.34B (5%)|-0.35B (-10%)|1.49B (9%)|0.58B (6%)|
|**Market Cap**|**3.36B**|**19.86B**|**15.28B**|**29.19B**|

To me, PENN is wildly under priced especially compared to DraftKings. It has 2x the revenue, a higher gross margin (than an online only operator...), and about $1B more in EBITDA, yet DKNG's market cap is trading 6x higher...

PENN also has a 11.33% Short Interest of outstanding shares which is just about 3x higher than the average of DKNG, MGM, CZR, FLTR, WYNN, BYD, and RRR. PENN is the highest % of the group (DKNG is next at 5.44%, yet it's financials aren't as strong)...

**Recent News of ESPN and PENN:**

Bob Iger (DIS/ESPN), during interviews and their earnings call, mentioned that they view ESPN as a foundation of their business. More importantly, they are planning to launch a standalone ESPN app ""in probably August of '25"" before the football season with ***""integrated betting, integrated fantasy...""*** They are obviously also doing the JV with Fox and WB Discovery which means more eyes on ESPN and more potential eyes on ESPN Bet.

To me, Iger is seeing ESPN as a long term opportunity in the growing sports and sports betting category. That means PENN wins. Don't forget, ESPN and DIS have ""$500 million of warrants to purchase approximately 31.8 million common shares of Penn. There are options to receive bonus warrants depending on the performance of ESPN BET.""

Who would ESPN rather promote, their own platform or someone elses? While DraftKings and FanDuel have to pay millions to advertise, PENN and ESPN have developed a strategy that lowers that marketing cost over the long term.

**Ok, how'd the Launch go?**

The lazy answer is we will find out this Thursday during earnings on 2/15. But I'm not here to be lazy...

States report betting revenues independently, so in prep of PENN's earnings next week I tracked their handle sizes over the past 24 months in the states that show online sports betting by operator. I wanted to get an idea of market share changes over the past two years and most importantly, how market share has changed since the launch of ESPN Bet.

For some reason I cannot post the charts here, but maybe I can in the comments. Nonetheless, PENN has dominated the launch. Their QoQ growth in Q4 2024 across IL, IN, IA, MD, KS, NJ, OH, and PE (combined handles) was over 150% when compared to Q3 2023. In each market except New Jersey they are either tied or have surpassed the 3rd largest operator behind DKNG and FanDuel.

This is crazy considering ESPN Bet launched on Nov 14th, halfway through Q4 and PENN mentioned they did not do any advertising in Oct. since they were under the Barstool name and were rebranding the next month to ESPN.

**So in 1.5 months, they were able to grow their entire QoQ handle in these markets over 150%...**

Now this isn't the full story as only a few states they operate in show these figures, and handle is not technically the revenue of the company, but it is a good idea of the market share growth which is what everyone is wanting to see. We will know the real numbers in 6 days.

**But I don't like the app**

Boo, don't care. Short term UI/UX problem that can be solved over time. Facebook was trash early on, so was everything. DKNG and FanDuel's apps were probably trash to begin with. If you want big returns, don't freak out about solvable problems in the short term...

**In conclusion...**

To me, PENN has way more room to run than DraftKings and FanDuel considering they have been a small operator, in fewer markets, in a quickly expanding industry with strong momentum. Portnoy even mentioned that Barstool's reputation made it hard for PENN to navigate the regulated industry and potentially land new licenses.

PENN ""failed fast"" with that poor partnership and is now on the coattails of a \~200M user (and 12M in their fantasy app) behemoth in ESPN that is actively looking to get sports betting integrated deeper into it's ecosystem over the long term...

Currently I have $10.4K in long positions (I see this mostly as a multi year growth play) and \~$6K in Call Options that have been pummeled since I first invested... but today they're doing well.

Poke holes in this thesis please.",2024-02-10,0

1123,Exclusive: Nvidia pursues $30 billion custom chip opportunity with new unit -sources,576,1an1m8t,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1an1m8t/exclusive_nvidia_pursues_30_billion_custom_chip/,65,"https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-chases-30-billion-custom-chip-market-with-new-unit-sources-2024-02-09/






SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Nvidia (NVDA.O), opens new tab is building a new business unit focused on designing bespoke chips for cloud computing firms and others, including advanced artificial intelligence (AI) processors, nine sources familiar with its plans told Reuters.

The dominant global designer and supplier of AI chips aims to capture a portion of an exploding market for custom AI chips and shield itself from the growing number of companies pursuing alternatives to its products.

The Santa Clara, California-based company controls about 80% of high-end AI chip market, a position that has sent its stock market value up 40% so far this year to $1.73 trillion after it more than tripled in 2023.

Nvidia's customers, which include ChatGPT creator OpenAI, Microsoft (MSFT.O), opens new tab, Alphabet (GOOGL.O), opens new tab and Meta Platforms (META.O), opens new tab, have raced to snap up the dwindling supply of its chips to compete in the fast-emerging generative AI sector.

Its H100 and A100 chips serve as a generalized, all-purpose AI processor for many of those major customers. But the tech companies have started to develop their own internal chips for specific needs. Doing so helps reduce energy consumption, and potentially can shrink the cost and time to design.

Nvidia is now attempting to play a role in helping these companies develop custom AI chips that have flowed to rival firms such as Broadcom (AVGO.O), opens new tab and Marvell Technology (MRVL.O), opens new tab, said the sources, who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

""If you're really trying to optimize on things like power, or optimize on cost for your application, you can't afford to go drop an H100 or A100 in there,"" Greg Reichow, general partner at venture capital firm Eclipse Ventures said in an interview. ""You want to have the exact right mixture of compute and just the kind of compute that you need.""

Nvidia does not disclose H100 prices, which are higher than for the prior-generation A100, but each chip can sell for $16,000 to $100,000 depending on volume and other factors. Meta plans to bring its total stock to 350,000 H100s this year.
Nvidia officials have met with representatives from Amazon.com (AMZN.O), opens new tab, Meta, Microsoft, Google and OpenAI to discuss making custom chips for them, two sources familiar with the meetings said. Beyond data center chips, Nvidia has pursued telecom, automotive and video game customers.

Nvidia shares rose 2.75% after the Reuters report, helping lift chip stocks overall. Marvell shares dropped 2.78%.

In 2022, Nvidia said it would let third-party customers integrate some of its proprietary networking technology with their own chips. It has said nothing about the program since, and Reuters is reporting its wider ambitions for the first time.
A Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment beyond the company's 2022 announcement.

Dina McKinney, a former Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O), opens new tab and Marvell executive, heads Nvidia's custom unit and her team's goal is to make its technology available for customers in cloud, 5G wireless, video games and automotives, a LinkedIn profile said. Those mentions were scrubbed and her title changed after Reuters sought comment from Nvidia.

Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta and OpenAI declined to comment.




**$30 BILLION MARKET**

According to estimates from research firm 650 Group‚Äôs Alan Weckel, the data center custom chip market will grow to as much as $10 billion this year, and double that in 2025.

The broader custom chip market was worth roughly $30 billion in 2023, which amounts to roughly 5% of annual global chip sales, according to Needham analyst Charles Shi.

Currently, custom silicon design for data centers is dominated by Broadcom and Marvell.

In a typical arrangement, a design partner such as Nvidia would offer intellectual property and technology, but leave the chip fabrication, packaging and additional steps to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (2330.TW), opens new tab or another contract chip manufacturer.

Nvidia moving into this territory has the potential to eat into Broadcom and Marvell sales.  ""With Broadcom's custom silicon business touching $10 billion, and Marvell‚Äôs around $2 billion, this is a real threat,"" said Dylan Patel, founder of silicon research group SemiAnalysis. ""It's a real big negative - there's more competition entering the fray.""

**BEYOND AI**

Nvidia is in talks with telecom infrastructure builder Ericsson (ERICb.ST), opens new tab for a wireless chip that includes the chip designer's graphics processing unit (GPU) technology, two sources familiar with the discussions said.
Ericsson declined to comment.

650 Group's Weckle expects the telecom custom chip market to remain flat at roughly $4 billion to $5 billion a year. Nvidia also plans to target the automotive and video game markets, according to sources and public social media postings.

Weckel expects the custom auto market to grow consistently from its current $6 billion to $8 billion range at 20% a year, and the $7 billion to $8 billion video game custom chip market could increase with the next-generation consoles from Xbox and Sony (6857.T), opens new tab.

Nintendo's current Switch handheld console already includes Nvidia's Tegra X1 chip. A new version of the Switch console expected this year is likely to include a Nvidia custom design, one source said.

**Stock Market‚Äôs ‚ÄòRah-Rah Mob‚Äô Confronts February‚Äôs Weak Record**

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-04/stock-market-s-rah-rah-mob-confronts-february-s-weak-record](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-04/stock-market-s-rah-rah-mob-confronts-february-s-weak-record)

* This month is historically among the three worst for equities
* Building bullish sentiment, Fed signals also raising red flags

&#x200B;

*With the S&P 500 Index coming off its best stretch in nearly four decades, the road gets tougher for investors as the calendar flips to February ‚Äî historically one of the rockiest times of the year for US stocks.*

*After a torrid rally of almost 20% since October that took the S&P 500 to its first records in two years, there‚Äôs ample reason for concern: Artificial-intelligence hype came in for a reality check with the latest batch of big-tech earnings; fevered speculation that the Federal Reserve would start easing next month has gone cold; and valuations remain elevated relative to history, evoking memories of the dot-com bubble for some strategists.*

*And then there‚Äôs February‚Äôs rough history ‚Äî it‚Äôs the third-worst month for the S&P 500 in the past 30 years, behind September and August, data compiled by Bloomberg show.*

*Some of Wall Street‚Äôs biggest optimists are growing worried that the enthusiasm that drove the surge to all-time highs is sending a contrarian signal. In the week through Jan. 30, a ratio of bulls to bears identified in an Investors Intelligence survey of newsletter writers hit its highest since around mid-2021, months before stocks neared their prior peak, Yardeni Research analysis shows.*

*‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a ‚Äòrah-rah‚Äô mob mentality in the stock market, with some traders drunk on their own wine,‚Äù betting on Fed easing as soon as March and upwards of six cuts this year, said Nick Giacoumakis, president of NEIRG Wealth Management. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs totally unrealistic. If you keep buying Big Tech stocks at these levels, you‚Äôre asking for trouble.‚Äù*

*This month is off to a banner start, with the market wrapping up its 13th gain in 14 weeks. The S&P 500 hasn‚Äôt seen a streak like that since 1986.*

*Solid earnings from Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. drove the strength at the end of last week, after Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs Google and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. released results that fell sort of investor expectations on AI.*

*February has a tendency to start on a high note, although the strength typically fades around mid-month as investors book profits, according to Jeffrey Hirsch, editor of the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac. That‚Äôs particularly the case if stocks get a boost in January ‚Äî like they often do ‚Äî following tax-loss harvesting in December.*

*For the skittish camp, the latest signals from the Fed are a source of angst.*

*Fed Chair Jerome Powell suggested last week that the central bank wasn‚Äôt about to lower rates anytime soon, and that was before Friday‚Äôs blockbuster jobs report. After that data, swaps traders chopped the probability of a March rate cut to around 20%, and no longer see a May reduction as a done deal.*

*For some would-be dip-buyers, that raises red flags, especially with the latest Deutsche Bank AG data showing that aggregate equity positioning among rules-based and discretionary funds is in the top quarter of observations going back to 2010. The bullish skew raises questions over who‚Äôs left to buy after fund managers piled into stocks at a furious pace in November, December and January.*

*‚ÄúI really hope we get a correction in the stock market soon,‚Äù said Nancy Tengler, chief investment officer at Laffer Tengler Investments. ‚ÄúA selloff may not feel good at first, but I have a lot of money that I want to put to work for my clients.‚Äù*

*She plans to use any pullback to add shares of Palo Alto Networks Inc., Microsoft and Amazon.*

*At NEIRG Wealth, Giacoumakis said he owns megacap tech stocks, which have driven the bulk of the market‚Äôs advance over the past year, but he isn‚Äôt adding to his position due to lofty valuations.*

*Members of the so-called Magnificent Seven companies, the biggest firms in the S&P 500 ‚Äî Apple Inc., Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia Corp. and Tesla Inc. ‚Äî carry a 33% premium to the index in terms of forward price-to-earnings, data compiled by Bloomberg show.*

*Of course, sentiment can stay frothy for weeks ‚Äî even months ‚Äî before stocks suffer a significant drop, notes Hirsch at the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac, who correctly called the S&P 500‚Äôs double-digit rise in 2023.*

*Take 2021, he said: Back then, the ratio of bulls to bears in the Investors Intelligence survey was hovering at current levels for most of that year, while equities continued to rip higher.*

*‚ÄúStocks are ripe for a pullback soon, but nothing sinister,‚Äù said Hirsch, who sees the S&P 500 potentially topping 5,000 this month before retreating to its prior high near 4,800 ‚Äî or a 4% drop.*

*‚ÄúMarket breadth is already lacking right now, with fewer stocks participating in this rally.‚Äù*",2024-02-09,0

As we know, short positions require more conviction and are more likely to be a made by a sophisticated investor, as they are borrowing money to keep the position open. Research has also shown that investors engaging in short selling typically focus on valuations and fundamentals more than the average investor.

I was wondering if any of you guys use short interest as a metric to value stocks and if you do not, what are you thoughts?

For example: not opening a position on stocks with more than 5% short interest.

I was thinking of backtesting a strategy that goes long bottom quintile and goes short top quintile and i was wondering if it is worth the time.

Before I go further, this is just a discussion post, not necessarily a ‚Äútechnical analysis‚Äù.

Full disclosure, I‚Äôve just recently yeeted into a decent chunk of my portfolio into Rivian averaging $15.50/share.

Yes, they keep asking for offerings for multiple billions of dollars in new funding, but it‚Äôs for the right reasons, and theoretically the correct results of in just a few years increasing their production capacity from 25k to over 500k. It takes massive capital to due this feat. Something I don‚Äôt think any other EV brand outside of TSLA is able to do, while also having the most superior product in the industry. 

The even better news being the demand has only skyrocketed, and (hope I don‚Äôt jinx it with upcoming quarterly report) there doesn‚Äôt seem to be signs of slowing demand. Which is huge because right now their cheapest car is $80k, and they‚Äôre soon announcing their $40k line that should supplement their existing $80k lines and commercial delivery truck lines to hit their max 500k capacity.

To me, my yolo bolo brain. It does not seem like a bizzare bet that in 2026 they sell at their 500k capacity as their popularity within the United States is still climbing, and launching an affordable line is only going to increase interest. 

Not to mention it‚Äôs a severely superior car to any Tesla line, and SUV/Trucks are largely preferred over sedans in the wealth class that can afford these vehicles in the U.S.",2024-02-09,0

 on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as North American demand for its food and drinks weakened.

CEO Ramon Laguarta said that U.S. sales broadly slowed down in the fourth quarter.

‚ÄúPart of that is a slowdown due to pricing and [consumers‚Äô] disposable income situation,‚Äù he told investors on the company‚Äôs conference call.

He added that U.S. consumers are also shifting their behavior from eating and drinking at home to picking up more of their snacks and Gatorade from convenience stores. But Laguarta expressed optimism about the overall state of the consumer, citing low unemployment and hopes that interest rates will fall by the summer and wages will rise faster than inflation.

Shares of the company fell 3% in morning trading.

Here‚Äôs what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: $1.78 adjusted vs. $1.72 expected

Revenue: $27.85 billion vs. $28.4 billion expected


Pepsi reported fourth-quarter net income of $1.3 billion, or 94 cents per share, up from $518 million, or 37 cents per share, a year earlier.

Excluding items, the food and beverage giant earned $1.78 per share.

Net sales dropped less than 1% to $27.85 billion. It‚Äôs the first quarter since 2020 that the company‚Äôs quarterly revenue has declined compared with the year-ago period. Currency exchange rates dragged net sales down by 1.5%.

Pepsi‚Äôs organic revenue, which excludes acquisitions and divestitures, rose 4.5% in the quarter, helped by higher prices. But those same raised prices have hurt demand for the company‚Äôs food and drinks. Pepsi‚Äôs volume, which strips out pricing and currency changes, slid again this quarter.

PepsiCo executives said high borrowing costs and lower personal savings have squeezed consumers‚Äô budgets, particularly in North America, in prepared remarks released ahead of the company‚Äôs conference call. They also said consumers are increasingly choosing smaller pack sizes for convenience and their low price points.

Pepsi‚Äôs North American Quaker Foods division reported an 8% decline in volume. A voluntary recall of its granola bars and cereals hurt its sales during the quarter, along with weaker growth for the overall category.

Frito-Lay North America, which includes brands like Cheetos and Doritos, posted a 2% drop in volume.

Pepsi‚Äôs North American beverage unit saw its volume fall 6% in the quarter.

For 2024, Pepsi now anticipates organic revenue will rise at least 4% and core constant currency earnings per share will climb at least 8%. The company previously forecast an increase in organic revenue on the high end of 4% to 6% and core constant currency earnings per share growth in the high single digits.

‚ÄúConsumers are likely to remain watchful with their budgets and choiceful with their purchases,‚Äù Pepsi executives said in the prepared remarks.

Pepsi is predicting a weaker first half of the year as product recalls dent its North American Quaker Oats business and international conflicts hurt sales in some regions. Executives are expecting international organic revenue growth to top that of North America for the full year.

* The prices consumers pay in the marketplace rose at an even slower pace than originally reported, according to closely watched revisions the government released Friday.

* Updates to the consumer price index showed that the broad basket of goods and services measured increased 0.2% on the month, less than the originally reported 0.3%, the Labor Department‚Äôs Bureau of Labor Statistics said.

* While the change is only modest, it helped confirm that inflation was moderating as 2023 ended, giving more leeway to the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates later this year.

The revisions are done as a matter of course for the BLS, but garnered extra attention this year after the market reacted sharply to last year‚Äôs changes. Indications that inflation in 2022 rose more than anticipated drove Treasury yields higher and sparked worry from investors that the Fed might keep monetary policy more restrictive.

Fed Governor Christopher Waller, in particular, had called attention to the 2022 revisions, sparking market attention for the latest round.

Excluding food and energy, so-called core CPI increased 0.3% for the month, the same as originally reported. Fed policymakers tend to focus more on core measures as they provide a better indication of long-run movements in inflation.

Also, the headline November reading was revised higher, up 0.2% versus the initial 0.1% estimate.

In aggregate, the revisions indicate that headline CPI accelerated at a 2.7% annualized rate in the fourth quarter, down 0.1 percentage point from the initially stated figures, according to Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.

The revisions amounted to ‚Äúa damp squib,‚Äù said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, though they could exert some influence on the Fed.

‚ÄúSince some Fed officials were apparently worried about a repeat of last year ‚Äî when the revision pushed up the monthly changes in core prices in the final few months of last year ‚Äî the lack of any meaningful change this year, at the margin at least, supports an earlier May rate cut,‚Äù Ashworth added.

The Fed priorities the personal consumption expenditures price index as its main inflation gauge. CPI readings feed into the Commerce Department‚Äôs PCE calculation. The difference between the two gauges is essentially that CPI reflects what items cost while PCE adjusts for what consumers actually buy, accounting for changes in behavior when prices rise and fall.

Futures market pricing was little changed after the data release.

Traders still largely expect the Fed to hold its benchmark overnight borrowing rate steady when it next meets in March, then cut in May, to be followed by four more quarter percentage point reductions by the end of the year, according to CME Group projections.",2024-02-09,0

Since the Dow is a price-weighted index, this split will decrease Walmart‚Äôs weighting in the index, initiating a rebalance to accommodate the drop in price.

It's intriguing to note that the Dow has been trailing behind the S&P 500 in performance YTD, increasing ~2.6% and ~5.4% respectively. 

Potentially prompting the index to consider adding new stocks to compensate for the YTD underperformance.

The last time the Dow underwent a significant change was in August 2020. At that time, Salesforce, Amgen, and Honeywell were added, while Exxon, Pfizer, and RTX Corp were removed.

Unlike their usual practices, the Dow committee has delayed making changes for an extended period of time, reminiscent of the period from June 2009 to September 2012.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

However, the stock market ignores all this nice technical expertise and trades unfounded expectations and hype -- and I never buy into the hype and look at all those green numbers on my watchlist only.

Some examples: I looked at NVIDIA when the crypto mining hype was on, with a background in high performance computing, and figured their GPUs were not energy efficient enough and this was quite obviously a task for ASICs, which proved correct in hindsight. I decided to stay out of what I considered an unfounded hype -- and missed out on the first big jump. 

I also looked at AI and big data-based predictive analysis and maintenance, back before the \*GPT hype, and with connections to high energy physicists who run serious big data analyses decided that that was not a good fit for typical industry data. Almost no one apart from perhaps the big cloud operators has enough raw data in their enterprise to do meaningful statistical analyses. From what I hear, this is also technically correct as many companies silently ditch their hopes to be able to do predictive maintenance now -- but I obviously missed out on that hype as well.

I've been closely following ACMR and its performance in the market, especially with the recent developments surrounding the company. They've recently opened a new facility in Hillsboro, Oregon which seems like a significant step forward in expanding their operations. Additionally, ACMR has updated their revenue outlook, suggesting a more optimistic future than previously anticipated. Their outlook on 2023 revenue from $530 to $545 million and projected 2024 revenue of $650 to $725 million

For people who don't know the company they specialize in developing, manufacturing, and selling single-wafer wet cleaning equipment, which is crucial for the production of advanced semiconductors. Their technology is designed to remove particles and contaminants from semiconductor wafers, improving the overall yield and reliability of semiconductor devices. 

Also their earnings have beaten expectations previous times. 

""For the quarter ended in November 2023, ACMR reported earnings of $0.57 per share, which beat the consensus estimate of $0.34 per share by $0.23.
https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/ACMR/earnings/

In the second quarter of 2023, ACMR reported quarterly earnings of $0.48 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.10 per share "". 
https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/acm-research-inc-acmr-q2-110506735.html

Considering all these positive developments, particularly in the semiconductor sector where ACMR operates, I wonder why the stock hasn't seen a more substantial increase in its value. 

I'm curious to hear your thoughts on this. Why do you think ACMR stock hasn't shot up as much as one might expect from a company with such positive indicators? Is there something I'm missing, or is the market not fully appreciating ACMR's potential? Any insights, analyses, or predictions you have would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks for sharing your thoughts!",2024-02-09,0

For those that don‚Äôt know  (like me) TSM is the largest chip foundry in the world. It only produces chips whereas a company like NVDA designs chips. I think what makes TSM different is it just cranks out the chips that its customers design. Please correct me if I am wrong here‚Ä¶.

Yep, regional bank and just in time for renewed gloom and doom for them based on the interest rate situation.


Anyhow, I noticed on Yahoofinance that it has a book value per share of $39.31, which is greater than the share price.  However it does have a revenue per share of $15.98.  I'm wondering does any of this specifically give a clear indication that it is undervalued?  Specifically, the current book value that is listed there.  I'm not planning to buy.

Here‚Äôs how the company did, in comparison with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: 15 cents, adjusted, vs. 12 cents expected

Revenue: $362.5 million, vs. $353.1 million expected


Cloudflare‚Äôs revenue rose about 32%, consisted with growth in the third quarter, according to a statement. The company‚Äôs net loss of $27.9 million, or 8 cents per share, narrowed from $45.9 million in the year-ago quarter.

CEO Matthew Prince said in the statement that Cloudflare signed its largest new customer deal and biggest renewal to date during the quarter, resulting in the highest annual contract value in corporate history. On a conference call with analysts, executives mentioned business from the U.S. Commerce Department.

Also on Thursday, Cloudflare said Mark Anderson, a board member who was formerly CEO of Alteryx
, is joining Cloudflare as president and replacing Marc Boroditsky. Private equity firms Clearlake Capital Group and Insight Partners announced in December that they would acquire Alteryx for $4.4 billion.

With respect to guidance, Cloudflare called for 13 cents in adjusted net earnings per share on $372.5 million to $373.5 million in revenue. Analysts surveyed by LSEG had expected 12 cents per share in adjusted earnings and revenue of $372.3 million.

For all of 2024, Cloudflare‚Äôs earnings outlook was higher than consensus, but the middle of the revenue range missed slightly. The company sees 58 cents to 59 cents in adjusted earnings per share and revenue from $1.648 billion to $1.652 billion. Analysts polled by LSEG were looking for 56 cents in adjusted earnings per share and $1.652 billion in revenue.

Excluding the after-hours move, Cloudflare stock is up about 8% so far this year, while the S&P 500 has gained about 5% during the same period.

News stations such as CTV and BNN Bloomberg would be affected immediately, according to an internal memo sent to Bell Media employees on Thursday.

The memo, signed by Dave Daigle, vice-president of local TV, radio and Bell Media Studios, and Richard Gray, vice-president of news at Bell Media, said weekday noon newscasts at all CTV stations except Toronto would end.

It is also scrapping its 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. newscasts on weekends at all CTV and CTV2 stations except Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa.

Daigle and Gray said ""multi-skilled journalists"" would replace news correspondent and technician teams reporting to CTV National News in Alberta, Manitoba, Quebec and Atlantic Canada, while other correspondent changes would be made in Ottawa.

Earlier in the day, Bell Media's parent company BCE Inc. announced it was cutting nine per cent of its workforce.

The company announced Thursday in an open letter signed by chief executive Mirko Bibic that 4,800 jobs ""at all levels of the company"" would be cut. Fewer than 10 per cent of the total job cuts are at Bell Media specifically.

This round of job cuts is BCE's largest in nearly 30 years, Bibic added during a Thursday conference call.

Some employees have already been notified or were to be informed Thursday of being laid off, while the balance will be told by the spring. Bibic said the company will use vacancies and natural attrition to minimize layoffs as much as possible.

Revenue: $981 million vs. $991 million expected, according to LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv.

Earnings: 53 cents per share, adjusted, vs. 51 cents per share expected, according to LSEG.


Revenue rose 12% year-over-year from $877.2 million a year earlier, while net income was $201 million, or 29 cents a share, up from $17.49 million, or 3 cents a share, a year ago. it brought in the previous year.

Monthly active users in the fourth quarter rose 11% to 498 million, topping analyst estimates of 487 million. The company said its global average revenue per user was $2, lower than analyst estimates of $2.05.

Pinterest said first-quarter revenue will be between $690 million and $705 million, which equates to year-over-year growth of 15% to 17%. The middle of that range, $697.5 million, is below the average analyst estimate of $703 million.

Pinterest‚Äôs report comes as the broader digital advertising market is showing recovery, with Meta
, Alphabet
 and Amazon
 all picking up steam and growing their ad business by double digits in the fourth quarter. The data suggests that businesses are boosting spending on online promotions after cutting back in 2022 and part of 2023 over concerns about the Ukraine-Russian war and high interest rates.

But not all online ad companies are seeing the benefits. Snap shares cratered 35% on Wednesday after the company reported fourth-quarter sales growth of 5%, trailing expectations, and the company also issued weak guidance.

Prior to Thursday‚Äôs report, Pinterest shares were up 9.5% this year after surging 53% in 2023.

Costs dropped about 10% from a year ago to $785 million, largely due to a decline in sales and marketing expenses. A year ago Pinterest slashed about 5% of its workforce, part of a mass waive of job cuts across the tech industry.

Arm Holdings Plc shares surged as much as 64% on Thursday after artificial intelligence spending helped bolster the chip designer‚Äôs forecast. And the company‚Äôs chief executive officer said the remarkable opportunity presented by AI is still in its early stages.

**‚ÄúAI is not in any way, shape or form a hype cycle,‚Äù Rene Haas said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. ‚ÄúWe believe that AI is the most profound opportunity in our lifetimes, and we‚Äôre only at the beginning.‚Äù**

The remarks followed a blockbuster earnings report Thursday, when Arm projected revenue of $850 million to $900 million for the March quarter. That far surpassed analysts‚Äô projections of $778 million. Earnings will be roughly 30 cents, excluding some items, well ahead of Wall Street‚Äôs 21-cent estimate.

Arm‚Äôs technology is going into an ever-widening array of products, from phones to cars to appliances. The scramble to add AI technology promises to accelerate that expansion, Haas said. In some cases, electronics makers don‚Äôt yet know how they‚Äôll fully harness AI ‚Äî they just want to make sure they have enough computing capacity to handle whatever is coming.

Arm once concentrated on technology for smartphones, but now that market accounts for about a third of sales. Phones today also contain more of the company‚Äôs technology per device, helping lift the royalties that manufacturers pay to Arm.

‚ÄúThis is the result of strategies that were put in place a number of years ago that are coming to fruition,‚Äù Haas said in the interview. ‚ÄúA lot of folks didn‚Äôt really understand the company well and where we fit in: But we‚Äôre in a Tesla vehicle, a Ford F-150, we are in a smart camera, a Samsung TV, the smart appliances.‚Äù

Arm‚Äôs bullish outlook, delivered late Wednesday, helped send the shares on their biggest intraday rally since an initial public offering last September. The stock traded as high as $126.59, adding tens of billions of dollars to Arm‚Äôs market valuation.

Another tailwind: The company‚Äôs customers are shifting to a new version of its technology called V9, which carries twice the royalty rate of its predecessors. They‚Äôre also using more Arm computing cores per device ‚Äî more than 100 in Microsoft Corp.‚Äôs new server chips, for example ‚Äî which amplifies royalties. Arm is also gaining market share from rival technology in the data-center and automotive markets, executives said.

Arm now expects sales of $3.16 billion to $3.21 billion in fiscal 2024, which runs through March. That‚Äôs up from a previous range that topped out at $3.08 billion.

Revenue grew 14% to $824 million in the fiscal third quarter. Excluding some items, profit was 29 cents a share. Wall Street had predicted revenue of $760 million and earnings of 25 cents a share.

Arm‚Äôs joint venture in China was a ‚Äúnice positive surprise‚Äù as well, according to Chief Financial Officer Jason Child. It contributed 25% of total revenue.

Arm has an unusual role in the semiconductor industry. It licenses the fundamental set of instructions that software uses to communicate with chips. The company also provides so-called design blocks that companies such as Qualcomm Inc. use to build their products.

Under Haas, Arm has been moving toward providing more complete layouts that can be taken directly to the manufacturing stage. That shift makes it more useful to some customers, such as cloud computing companies like Amazon.com Inc., but also more of a rival to some traditional clients, like Qualcomm.

Cambridge, England-based Arm is still 90%-owned by SoftBank Group Corp., which acquired the business in 2016 for $32 billion. An IPO in 2023 raised $4.9 billion, marking the biggest debut on a US exchange in 2023.


Arm‚Äôs licensing sales rose 18% to $354 million last quarter, and royalty revenue gained 11% to $470 million.

Arm‚Äôs customer list spans the technology industry. Apple Inc. uses its instruction set for the processors that power the iPhone and Mac computers. Amazon relies on Arm designs for its Graviton server processors for data centers. And Qualcomm and MediaTek Inc. are major users of Arm‚Äôs blueprints for smartphone processors.",2024-02-08,0

**Forbes**: **Disney Stock Soars: Set For Best Day Since 2020**.

""Disney shares staged one of their strongest single-day rallies this millennium Thursday on the back of the company‚Äôs blowout earnings report, though the entertainment titan still has a ways to go to recapture its former glory on the stock market.

Disney‚Äôs stock ballooned almost 13% to just shy of $112 by mid-afternoon, hitting its highest intraday level since Feb. 9, 2023. Should the gains hold, Thursday will be Disney stock‚Äôs best day since December 2020 and its fifth-best day since 2000, according to FactSet data.

The dramatic rise for Disney came a day after the company delivered strong quarterly results and projected $4.60 earnings per share for its fiscal year ending in September, which would make 2024 its most profitable fiscal year since 2019.

Bank of America was among several Wall Street firms to dramatically bump its price target for Disney, upping its target from $110 to $130, with analysts led by Jessica Reif Ehrlich remarking they were ‚Äúincredibly encouraged‚Äù by Disney‚Äôs bottom line progress under the tutelage of CEO Bob Iger, whose initiatives ‚Äúare already having an impact‚Äù 15 months into Iger‚Äôs second tenure at the helm of Disney.""

If a corporation made X amount of money in a year, they would be taxed on all money after expenses have been paid for.
There are those who would spend as much money on equipment as possible so they can accumulate assets with before taxed money so they have very few taxes to pay.
So I'm wondering can a corporation by stocks like ETF index funds, or SNP 500 with pre tax money, and would they be able to defer the tax until they sold it many years in the future ???

Maybe I'm asking a foolish question, I just have been wondering this for a while

Say for example

The corporation I own the majority of the shares in Makes 100k. Now I will pay myself a salary of 50k, and the the rest, or the majority of the money left from this year's earning would just be used to buy stocks so my money grows with the market and I don't have to pay tax on that yet.

I was looking at this company and something kind of stood out to me. This company absolutely prints money. In 2023 they had 19 billion dollars in free cash flow with pretty consistent numbers before. Margins are high with gross margin at about 63%. They have basically no CapEx. They had operating cash flow of 19.9 billion while only spending 900 million on CapEx. Their debt is almost non-existent. Debt/EBITDA sits at about 0.36 which is one of the lowest multiples I have seen in the market. Especially from a large cap company. They can basically pay off all their debt in a half of year if they wanted too. The main issue that people have with Cisco is that their growth is really really slow. Their revenue has stayed the same for basically a decade which reflects in their stock price with the only exception being in 2023. I guess my question is why doesn‚Äôt Cisco do anything with their cash?

They had operating cash flow of 19.9 billion. They spent 900 billion on CapEx. That leaves 19 billion. What do they do with it? They spent 6.3 billion dollars in dividends. That uses about 33% of their cash and still leaves them with 12.7 billion. What else? They repurchased stock. About 4.3 billion dollars went towards share repurchases. That still leaves 8.4 billion dollars that they‚Äôre just not doing anything with. Debt payments? Their debt is non-existent. They don‚Äôt need to pay down debt. Acquisition‚Äôs? Nope, only 850 million. My question is where is all this money going and why aren‚Äôt they doing anything with it to grow the business more quickly or reward shareholders? 

They can throw a ton of this money back into the business and to try to focus on growing but they don‚Äôt. Ok lets say law of big numbers has caught up and they really can‚Äôt grow anymore. If this is the case why don‚Äôt they use that cash on shareholders? They do pay a nice easily affordable dividend but they barely grow it. Like literally 1 cent every year. Their stock is cheap (trades at a EV/EBITDA of 10.1) so why are they not buying back stock aggressively. Better yet they can easily leverage some debt and do 20 billion dollar massive stock buybacks and still have a very healthy debt ratio if they wanted. Like why isn‚Äôt this company just doing anything? They got all this cash and they‚Äôre choosing to barely use it. 

Maybe I am not seeing something so any help would be appreciated. Thank you.",2024-02-08,0

Bard, a chief competitor to OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT, is now called Gemini, the same name as the suite of AI models that power the chatbot.

Google also announced new ways for consumers to access the AI tool: As of Thursday, Android users can download a new dedicated Android app for Gemini, and iPhone users can use Gemini within the Google app on iOS.

Google‚Äôs rebrand and app offerings underline the company‚Äôs commitment to pursuing ‚Äî and investing heavily in ‚Äî AI assistants or agents, a term often used to describe tools ranging from chatbots to coding assistants and other productivity tools.

Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted the firm‚Äôs commitment to AI during the company‚Äôs Jan. 30 earnings call. Pichai said he eventually wants to offer an AI agent that can complete more and more tasks on a user‚Äôs behalf, including within Google Search, although he said there is ‚Äúa lot of execution ahead.‚Äù Likewise, chief executives at tech giants from Microsoft to Amazon underlined their commitment to building AI agents as productivity tools.

Google‚Äôs Gemini changes are a first step to ‚Äúbuilding a true AI assistant,‚Äù Sissie Hsiao, a vice president at Google and general manager for Google Assistant and Bard, told reporters on a call Wednesday.

Google on Thursday also announced a new AI subscription option, for power users who want access to Gemini Ultra 1.0, Google‚Äôs most powerful AI model. Access costs $19.99 per month through Google One, the company‚Äôs paid storage offering. For existing Google One subscribers, that price includes the storage plans they may already be paying for. There‚Äôs also a two-month free trial available.

Thursday‚Äôs rollouts are available to users in more than 150 countries and territories, but they‚Äôre restricted to the English language for now. Google plans to expand language offerings to include Japanese and Korean soon, as well as other languages.

The Bard rebrand also affects Duet AI, Google‚Äôs former name for the ‚Äúpackaged AI agents‚Äù within Google Workspace and Google Cloud, which are designed to boost productivity and complete simple tasks for client companies including Wayfair, GE, Spotify and Pfizer. The tools will now be known as Gemini for Workspace and Gemini for Google Cloud.

Google One subscribers who pay for the AI ‚Äã‚Äãsubscription will also have access to Gemini‚Äôs assistant capabilities in Gmail, Docs, Sheets, Slides and Meet, executives told reporters Wednesday. Google hopes to incorporate more context into Gemini from users‚Äô content in Gmail, Docs and Drive. For example, if you were responding to a long email thread, suggested responses would eventually take in context from both earlier messages in the thread and potentially relevant files in Google Drive.

As for the reason for the broad name change? Google‚Äôs Hsiao told reporters Wednesday that it‚Äôs about helping users understand that they‚Äôre interacting directly with the AI ‚Äã‚Äãmodels that underpin the chatbot.

‚ÄúBard [was] the way to talk to our cutting-edge models, and Gemini is our cutting-edge models,‚Äù Hsiao said.

Eventually, AI agents could potentially schedule a group hangout by scanning everyone‚Äôs calendar to make sure there are no conflicts, book travel and activities, buy presents for loved ones or perform a specific job function such as outbound sales. Currently, though, the tools, including Gemini, are largely limited to tasks such as summarizing, generating to-do lists or helping to write code.

‚ÄúWe will again use generative AI there, particularly with our most advanced models and Bard,‚Äù Pichai said on the Jan. 30 earnings call, speaking about Google Assistant and Search. That ‚Äúallows us to act more like an agent over time, if I were to think about the future and maybe go beyond answers and follow-through for users even more.‚Äù

The correct answer to this question will most likely be part of a cutting edge industry. It seems like that was the key to success for all the companies I listed. 

Apple / Microsoft  - personal computer boom

Google / Amazon / Netflix / Meta - personal computer applications boom

Tesla - EV vehicle boom

What‚Äôs the point of value or fundamental ETFs (FNDX/SPYV) when they are correlated with growth? 

Take todays market where there is a large valuation gap between value/fundamental vs growth. Should a growth sell off start, value will be equally impacted albeit with a lower drawdown.

When the market picks up, it will be growth leading the charge as 2023/2021 saw.

My question is therefore: what is the point of value if it does not hedge against growth sell offs and underperforms in bull markets

Instead, the soaring sea freight has already led to either change of shipment mode (from Ocean to Ocean + Air + Rail + Road, i.e. multi-modal) or delays in procurement / production plan (hoping for improving situation as time evolves).

With the prolonged disruption in Red Sea / Suez Canal, it is supposed that more and more companies will be affected in 2024Q1, earnings releases in April or May this year may look bad ...

KEY POINTS

* Danish shipping giant Maersk on Thursday flagged ‚Äúhigh uncertainty‚Äù in its 2024 earnings outlook as Red Sea disruptions continue to weigh on the industry.
* Shares were trading 13.5% lower at 8:14 a.m. London time.
* The company said its board had decided to ‚Äúimmediately suspend the share buy-back programme, with a re-initiation to be reviewed once market conditions in Ocean \[division\] have settled.‚Äù

*Shares of Danish shipping giant Maersk slumped more than 14% in early trade Thursday after it flagged ‚Äúhigh uncertainty‚Äù in its 2024 earnings outlook amid Red Sea disruptions and an oversupply of shipping vessels.*

*The company also said that it would be suspending share buybacks on the back of the uncertainty.*

*Maersk said it expected underlying EBITDA (or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) of between $1 billion and $6 billion this year, compared to the $9.6 billion recorded in 2023.*

*Shares were trading 13.5% lower at 10:25 a.m. London time.*

*‚ÄúThe impact of this situation is causing new uncertainty for how this is going to play out from an earnings perspective throughout the year,‚Äù CEO Vincent Clerc told CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúSquawk Box Europe.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúWe have very little visibility as to whether this is a situation that will resolve in a matter of weeks or months, or whether this is something that is going to be with us for the full year,‚Äù he added.*

*In a statement, the company added that its board had decided to ‚Äúimmediately suspend the share buy-back programme, with a re-initiation to be reviewed once market conditions in Ocean \[division\] have settled.‚Äù*

*It comes as the company reported fourth-quarter profit below expectations Thursday, with EBITDA for the three-month period dropping to $839 million versus the $1.13 billion anticipated by analysts.*

*Global supply chains have faced serious disruption since late 2023 after major shipping companies began diverting journeys away from the Red Sea following a string of attacks by Yemen‚Äôs Houthi rebels.*

*The Iran-aligned group has targetted commercial vessels with drones and missiles in what they say is an act of solidarity with Palestinians amid the ongoing Gaza-Israel war.*

*The diversions around one of the world‚Äôs busiest shipping lanes have pushed up delivery times and costs, with the OECD warning Monday that it could increase inflation.*

*The Paris-based group said that the recent 100% rise in seaborne freight rates, if persistent, could see import price inflation across its 38 member countries rise by nearly 5 percentage points.*

*The rerouting has boosted freight rates for shipping companies, but Clerc said it was unlikely that those increases would feed through to profits.*

*‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think from an earnings perspective, for the industry or for Maersk, when you look at it in its entirety that this is going to be something where we generate significant profit out of the situation,‚Äù he said.*

*‚ÄúIt is something where today the amount of cost we‚Äôre absorbing in order to keep the global supply chain going is still unknown.‚Äù*

I'm.

> I used an airbnb recently and had a fantastic experience. Great host, remote area, lots of value add without all the crazy rules.

It‚Äôs gotten way out of hand and personally I‚Äôd love to see the whole thing crash and burn with a few exceptions.

Whole neighborhoods build for Airbnb tells me that there is huge demand still.

> Classic Reddit bias where the people with poor experiences are much more likely to post. Have people had bad experiences, yes. But I‚Äôm quite confident the mix of negative reviews here means nothing in the big picture.

I agree.

Lastly, I noticed that my general disappointment with Airbnb is that it isn't widely available in the places I want to travel to - not that I hate the service. Furthermore, I disliked the fact that my building has a lot of Airbnb apartments, which annoys me as a full-time renter.

The shares soared more than 20% in extended trading.

Here‚Äôs how the company did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ending December:

Revenue: $824 million, vs. $761 million expected

EPS: 29 cents adjusted, vs 25 cents expected.


Arm, whose chip design technology is in nearly every smartphone and many PCs, said it expects earnings per share for the fiscal fourth quarter of between 28 cents and 32 cents on sales of $850 million to $900 million. Analysts expectations earnings of 21 cents per share on sales of $780 million.

The company reported net income of $87 million, or 8 cents per share. Total revenue in the quarter increased 14% from a year earlier.

Arm makes money through royalties, when companies pay for access to build Arm-compatible chips, usually amounting to a small percentage of the final chip price.

Arm said its customers shipped 7.7 billion Arm chips during the September quarter, which is the most recent period which figures are available.

Royalty revenue increased 11% on an annual basis to $470 million. The company said the jump was partially because of a recovery in the smartphone market, as well as increasing sales to automotive companies and cloud providers. Arm said that it expects growth to be driven by royalty revenue.

In recent years, Arm has emphasized its licensing business, selling access to more complete designs that semiconductor companies can take and plug into their planned chips. That process saves chipmakers time and effort, and it‚Äôs more lucrative for Arm than simply collecting royalties.

Arm‚Äôs license and other revenue was $354 million, up 18% year-over-year. Arm said more companies were choosing to license its CPU designs to run artificial intelligence, and that the company charges higher licensing fees for advanced designs.

Arm, which had been owned by SoftBank, went public in September. The company was founded in 1990 to develop technology for low-power chips, but became more important to the overall technology industry when the Apple
 iPhone and competing Android devices standardized on Arm-based chips.

Arm says that companies including Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Nvidia use its technology.

The company hiked its guidance, and now expects fiscal 2024 earnings per share of about $4.60, which would be at least 20% higher than 2023. 

Disney said it is on pace to meet or exceed its goal of cutting costs by at least $7.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2024. 

Here is what Disney reported compared with what Wall Street expected, according to LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: $1.22 vs. 99 cents expected

Revenue:$23.55 billion vs. $23.64 billion expected


Disney‚Äôs direct-to-consumer unit reported a $138 million operating loss in the quarter. Including the performance at ESPN+, losses for all its streaming businesses narrowed to $216 million, from $1.05 billion in the prior-year period.

Disney+ core subscribers shrank by 1.3 million from the prior quarter due to price increases, but the company saw a rise in average revenue per user because of those subscription cost hikes.

The company posted the improvements to its streaming business a day after it announced Tuesday that it will launch a new sports streaming venture among ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery later this year. 

While no price has been determined, a logical starting point could be $45 or $50 per month with introductory pricing lower to entice signups, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions around the service have been private.

Disney‚Äôs earning results come as its board battles again with activist investor Nelson Peltz and Blackwells Capital.

While Peltz ended a previous proxy battle against Disney a year ago after the company committed to numerous cost-cutting initiatives, he revived his fight last fall, looking to shake up the board and earn himself and former Disney Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo a seat.

Peltz has cited the company‚Äôs stock plunge, a drop in consensus earnings estimates and disappointing studio content as he has pushed for a board shake-up.

CEO Bob Iger has publicly addressed Disney‚Äôs theatrical release woes and vowed to rely less on sequels and more on fresh, quality films. Of course, production timelines are often in the ballpark of 18 months, so Disney‚Äôs box office haul likely will not change until 2025 or 2026. At that point, Disney is slated to release four mega blockbusters: an Avatar film, two Star Wars features and an Avengers team-up flick.

Also of note to investors is this is the second quarter that Disney is using its new financial reporting structure, which segmented the company into three divisions: entertainment, sports and experiences. Entertainment contains all of Disney‚Äôs streaming and media operations, sports includes ESPN and experiences includes the company‚Äôs theme parks, hotels, cruise line and merchandising efforts.

PANW is a multinational cybersecurity company. According to Wikipedia, the core product is a platform that includes advanced firewalls and cloud-based offerings that extend those firewalls to cover other aspects of security. The company serves over 70,000 organizations in over 150 countries, including 85 of the Fortune 100.

|Total Revenue|$1.878 billion|$7.512 billion|$1.563 billion|

|Operating Income|$215 million|$860 million|$15 million|
|||||
|Net Income|$194 million|$776 million|$20 million|

Just taking a basic look at these, we see PANW is growing revenues at a good rate, but it's also hyper profitable from a cost of revenue perspective. Their cost of revenue is very low and their gross profit margins are high. For a growing company, this is awesome. They also are increasing R&D while G&A expenses aren't growing at the same rate, but even with these growing costs, they are still making money and making money at a faster rate.

Heading this growth is Nikesh Arora. Now I'll say this, I didn't really know who this guy was before I started looking into this, but after reading up on him, he was a senior executive at Google and formerly the president and COO of Softbank (pre pandemic). He's also got a great reputation as a leader and innovator. The only trickle down methodology i believe in is when you have good leadership.

Also, I don't know how to add pictures but if you take a look at their BOD you can't look at James Goetz and tell me he might not be a super genius based off the size of his head. [https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/about-us/management](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/about-us/management)

Jokes aside, the biggest red flag with this stock is their valuation. A company doing less than $10 billion in sales and hovering around net income of $1 billion is valued at a whopping $114 billion. For comparison, Cisco is a big competitor to PANW and their 2023 revenue was $57 billion, net income: $12.6 billion, and market cap of $202 billion. Needless to say, PANW is heavily overvalued currently.

Moving forward, the cybersecurity sector is rapidly growing and there is room for PANW to keep growing with it. Do you see this stock flopping? Do you see it 2x, 5x, 10x in the coming decade? Would love to hear people's thoughts. As for me, I'll keep buying each month until the numbers stop showing huge growth.",2024-02-07,0

1176,Advice needed regarding reverse share split,0,1al4sf7,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1al4sf7/advice_needed_regarding_reverse_share_split/,6,"Hi everyone,

I am not trading for long time, so I am missing some knowledge here and I truly believe Reddit is the best place to seek for help (lol). I do own stocks of a company and they announced reverse share split (link to the article - [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/orpea-announces-details-expected-timetable-070000100.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/orpea-announces-details-expected-timetable-070000100.html) )

Let¬¥s say I do own 1 mil of shares, with the average price of 0,0169‚Ç¨ / share. My question here is, during the exchange period, is price of the share globally considered being 0,01‚Ç¨ or is my buying price of that specific share being considered? In above mentioned announcement is part saying, that ""The Reverse Share Split is a purely technical exchange transaction with no direct impact on the total value of the Company's shares held by each shareholder.""

If my 1 mil shares is having current value of 16k‚Ç¨ is it going to end up, that after exchange I will loose 6k‚Ç¨ due to exchange or is the exchange made based on ""value of shares"" rather then ""amount of shares owned""?

&#x200B;

\[(1 000 000 existing shares / 1 000 new shares) \* 10‚Ç¨ nominal new share price\] = 10k‚Ç¨ shares value

&#x200B;

Sorry for silly question, this particular purchase was something like ""ah those are for free, let¬¥s buy it and keep it laying down 3-4-5 years"", but now I am not sure how this is going to end up for me and If I am supposed to lose money due reverse share split, I might take it out and invest it somewhere else.

&#x200B;

**EDIT:** Announcement of reverse share split is 2 days old. I have made a research prior to buying stocks of this company, I knew they are going through restructuralization of the whole company and board of directors and basically they are trying to bring the company back. I have also considered the business area where this company operates and nursing / care seemed fine to me. I don¬¥t want to delete any parts of my original post but also don¬¥t want to look like a dumbo who sorted stock price and bought randomly the cheapest stocks available without thinking or research. 

Any explanation and advice is very welcome, thanks folks!",2024-02-07,0

1178,Macro report: Freight Cost Increases Due to Red Sea Disruption,13,1al45qy,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1al45qy/macro_report_freight_cost_increases_due_to_red/,1,"# Executive Summary

The ongoing crisis in the Red Sea has precipitated a significant rerouting of maritime traffic, with profound implications for global trade and freight costs. This report examines the economic impact of increased freight costs due to the Red Sea disruption, focusing on the affected companies and industries. The analysis draws on recent data and expert commentary to provide a comprehensive overview of the situation.

## Introduction

The Red Sea, a critical maritime route for global trade, has been experiencing heightened security risks due to attacks by Houthi militants. This has led to a substantial rerouting of shipping traffic, with many vessels now circumnavigating the Cape of Good Hope, resulting in longer transit times and higher operational costs. The disruption has had a cascading effect on freight rates, supply chain dynamics, and global trade patterns.

## Freight Cost Increases

### Container Rates and Surcharges

The redirection of vessels around the Cape of Good Hope has more than tripled container rates since January, with delays and knock-on effects expected to persist well into the second quarter of 2024 ([ING, 2024](https://think.ing.com/articles/red-sea-shipping-disruption-rages-on-and-the-impact-will-continue-well-into-2024/)). The container shipping sector has introduced various surcharges, including the bunker adjustment (BAF), Emissions surcharge (EMS), port congestion surcharges (PCS), and transit disruption charges (TSD), further complicating the market and pushing up container rates ([ING, 2024](https://think.ing.com/articles/red-sea-shipping-disruption-rages-on-and-the-impact-will-continue-well-into-2024/)).

### Impact on Shipping Companies

Major shipping companies such as Maersk and CMA CGM have introduced new charges to manage the increased costs associated with longer routes. For instance, Maersk imposed a Transit Disruption Surcharge (TDS) and an Emergency Contingency Surcharge (ECS) on several trade routes ([CNN, 2023](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/22/business/maersk-cma-cgm-shipping-charges-red-sea/index.html)). These surcharges are a direct response to the heightened risks and operational challenges of avoiding the Red Sea.

### Impact on Trade

The rerouting has introduced new inefficiencies in trade, although it is unlikely to derail it entirely. The crisis has masked underlying overcapacity in the shipping industry, which may exert downward pressure on rates once the disruption is resolved ([ING, 2024](https://think.ing.com/articles/red-sea-shipping-disruption-rages-on-and-the-impact-will-continue-well-into-2024/)). However, the current situation has led to a rapid rebound in container rates, with further increases possible ([ING, 2024](https://think.ing.com/articles/red-sea-shipping-disruption-rages-on-and-the-impact-will-continue-well-into-2024/)).

## Affected Companies and Industries

### Shipping and Logistics

Shipping companies are directly affected by the increased costs of rerouting and the associated surcharges. The impact on their operational margins is significant, with some analysts predicting a turnaround in sinking margins for container liners in the wake of the Red Sea disruption ([ING, 2024](https://think.ing.com/articles/red-sea-shipping-disruption-rages-on-and-the-impact-will-continue-well-into-2024/)). The crisis has also led to a rise in insurance risk premiums for sailing through high-risk areas ([The Guardian, 2023](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/03/what-is-the-red-sea-crisis-and-what-does-it-mean-for-global-trade)).

### Consumer Goods and Retail

The consumer goods sector, which relies heavily on container vessels for the transportation of finished and semi-finished products, is particularly vulnerable to the increased shipping costs. An estimated 30% of the world's traded consumer goods are shipped through the Suez route, and higher transport costs will inevitably raise costs for shippers and potentially for consumers ([ING, 2024](https://think.ing.com/articles/red-sea-shipping-disruption-rages-on-and-the-impact-will-continue-well-into-2024/)).

### Automotive and Electronics

The automotive and consumer electronics sectors, known for their reliance on just-in-time delivery and global supply chains, are expected to be among the hardest hit by the Red Sea crisis. The rerouting leads to longer delivery times and higher transportation costs, which could affect production schedules and retail prices ([The National News, 2023](https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/economy/2023/12/19/red-sea-crisis-to-affect-consumers-worldwide-as-shipping-costs-set-to-rise/)).

### Energy Sector

The energy sector has also been impacted, with global oil prices rising due to concerns over delays in the Red Sea. Crude prices have remained relatively stable but are sensitive to further disruptions ([The Guardian, 2024](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/03/what-is-the-red-sea-crisis-and-what-does-it-mean-for-global-trade)). Energy companies like BP have halted shipments through the Red Sea, which could lead to higher energy costs if the situation persists ([The Guardian, 2023](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/03/what-is-the-red-sea-crisis-and-what-does-it-mean-for-global-trade)).

## Impact on Global Trade and Inflation

The disruption in the Red Sea has contributed to a 1.3% fall in global trade from November to December, with potential implications for global economic growth ([CNN, 2024](https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/09/shipping-costs-have-risen-up-to-250-since-the-red-sea-attacks-began/)). Freight costs have a significant inflationary impact, and the International Monetary Fund estimated that global supply chain bottlenecks added about 1 percentage point to inflation during the Covid pandemic ([The Guardian, 2024](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/03/what-is-the-red-sea-crisis-and-what-does-it-mean-for-global-trade)).

## Conclusion

The Red Sea shipping crisis has led to a substantial increase in freight costs, affecting a wide range of companies and industries. Shipping and logistics companies are facing higher operational costs and insurance premiums, while sectors reliant on timely deliveries, such as automotive and consumer goods, are grappling with increased transportation costs and potential production delays. The energy sector is also affected, with potential implications for global energy prices. The overall impact on global trade and inflation is significant, with the potential to add 0.7 percentage points to global CPI inflation by the end of 2024 if the situation persists ([The National News, 2024](https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/2024/01/09/shipping-costs-have-risen-up-to-250-since-the-red-sea-attacks-began/)).

U.S.-listed shares in the Chinese e-commerce giant were are one point more than 5% higher in pre-market trade, but turned slightly negative after.

Alibaba said the $25 billion increase is added to its share repurchase program through the end of March 2027, bringing the total available under the scheme to $35.3 billion.

The announcement comes as Alibaba released financial results for its December quarter.

Here‚Äôs how Alibaba did in its fiscal third quarter, compared to LSEG estimates:

Revenue: 260.35 billion Chinese yuan ($36.6 billion) versus 262.07 billion yuan expected.

Revenue missed expectations, growing just 5% year-over-year, logging a slowdown from the previous quarters as growth in the company‚Äôs China e-commerce business and cloud computing division remained slow.

Alibaba has been grappling with a difficult macroeconomic environment in China, where the consumer has remained weak, even after Beijing removed its Covid-era restrictions. Amid economic uncertainties, local shoppers have flocked to discounting platforms such as Alibaba rival Pinduoduo.

The Taobao and Tmall business, Alibaba‚Äôs China e-commerce platforms, brought in revenue of 129.1 billion Chinese yuan in the December quarter, up just 2% year-on-year.

Alibaba‚Äôs cloud computing business, which investors have seen as critical to the tech giant‚Äôs future growth, brought in sales of 28.1 billion yuan, a 3% year-on-year rise.

In a statement, recently-appointed Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu said the company‚Äôs focus is on growth in e-commerce and cloud.

‚ÄúOur top priority is to reignite the growth of our core businesses, e-commerce and cloud computing. We will step up investment to improve users‚Äô core experiences to drive growth in Taobao and Tmall Group and strengthen market leadership in the coming year.‚Äù

Alibaba had a tumultuous year in 2023, when it carried out its largest-ever corporate structure overhaul. It also separately implemented several high-profile management changes, with company veteran Eddie Wu taking over the reins as chief executive in September.

Daniel Zhang, the previous CEO of Alibaba Group who became acting head of the cloud business in December 2022, was supposed to stay on to lead the business unit, but unexpectedly quit in September last year.

On top of its structural changes, Alibaba also scrapped the hotly-anticipated spinoff of its cloud computing business last year.

More recently, two of Alibaba‚Äôs co-founders, Jack Ma and Joe Tsai, in January bought shares worth around $200 million in the Chinese e-commerce giant.

1181,The UK Government is looking to sell it's share of NatWest Group [NWG] to the public - so what happens next?,8,1akz739,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1akz739/the_uk_government_is_looking_to_sell_its_share_of/,1,"Following the government bailout of RBS (now NWG) in 2008, the UK Government acquired a stake of 84% of the bank. It has slowly been selling these shares off, and is down to about 40% now. The government are keen to get NWG off their books in the next couple of years, and there is talk of a large public sale of the shares in June.

The stock was bought at 500p by the government, and currently sits at 220p. There is talk that the government would sell at a \~5% discount to the market rate. NWG provides a dividend payment of around 7%, so there could be interest for a deal by private investors.

But what is the likely impact from such a large sale? Surely flooding the market could cause the shares to fall by more than 5%, making the discounted rate pretty meaningless? Or would there be an opposite effect whereby the popularity of buying the shares 'cheap' in the mainstream in a few months would drive the share price up? The shares have fallen from around 300p over the past few months, so there may be market expectations of the former which have been largely baked in.

At any rate it feels like some volatility is ahead.  The Q4 results are announced next Friday.

1182,$IOVA iovance - THE FIRST approved cell therapy for solid tumor indications (???),16,1akz18x,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1akz18x/iova_iovance_the_first_approved_cell_therapy_for/,7,"**First Finance, as reported:**

Iovance had $427.8 million in cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash at September 30, 2023, compared to $478.3 million at December 31, 2022. The current cash position and anticipated revenue in 2024 from lifileucel and Proleukin¬Æ is expected to be sufficient to fund current and planned operations into 2025.

**2024 Outlook**

* FDA Priority Review of Biologics License Application (BLA) on Track for Lifileucel in Advanced Melanoma with Prescription Drug User Fee Act Action (PDUFA) Date of February 24, 2023
* Positive Regulatory Feedback Supports Lifileucel Regulatory Submissions in Europe and Canada in 2024

Iovance has reached an exciting point in its growth story. Regulators are reviewing the company's lead product, lifileucel for advanced melanoma, and are set to issue a **decision on or before Feb. 24**. The drug could bring in global sales of as much as **$959 million in 2029**. 

A look at their **career section**, implies all wheel are in motion. If approved of course. 

**Additional** 

*  TIL therapies include IOV-GM1-201 to investigate PD-1 inactivated TIL therapy (IOV-4001) in previously treated advanced melanoma or NSCLC as well as pivotal Cohort 2 in the ongoing C-145-04 trial of lifileucel to support a BLA in cervical cancer following progression on or after chemotherapy and pembrolizumab.
* A novel interleukin-2 (IL-2) analog (IOV-3001) is in Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies supporting its use as part of the TIL treatment regimen following TIL infusion.
* Additional research and preclinical studies are exploring approaches to increase TIL potency using CD39/69 double negative TILs and stable gene incorporation enhancements such as tethered cytokines.

**Set back (in one of many studies)**

On Dec 22, 2023, the FDA placed a clinical hold on the IOV-LUN-202 study following a grade 5 (fatal) serious adverse effect, potentially related to the non-myeloablative lymphodepletion pre-conditioning regimen observed in the study.

**Concluding**

Getting its melanoma program approved would be huge, as it'd mark **THE FIRST APPROVAL** of a cell therapy for a solid tumor indication. The company would start to make sales for the first time, and it might even be profitable by early 2025. 

If approved, history is made. As to the effect on the stock, over time....

I am writing from Europe, and I am considering starting to invest. I am a risk lover, it is not a problem for me to see my investments go down and I have a solid financial situation.

I am quite new to this; so far I only know that I have to look for a low TER and that here, fiscally, it is better to invest in Funds (either passive or active) than in ETFs.

After a bit of research here I have made a kind of ranking (without much knowledge, I insist), I would appreciate opinions. In the end I am looking for a fund with the cheapest (Ter) and that can give the highest return.

3. SPY, S&P500
4. XEQT, VEQT, XQQ, XWD, ZGQ

As of now I have: Seilern Stryx World Growth EUR U, Amundi IS MSCI world AE-C

I would invest in euros, can you advise me which of these funds or any others (I am aware that most of them are ETFs, do you know the equivalent in fund?) are interesting to keep an eye on? I will start moving money towards there in a couple month I assume

1189,A quick explanation on why fractional betting is so important,25,1akmcwx,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1akmcwx/a_quick_explanation_on_why_fractional_betting_is/,25,"Let‚Äôs set up a bet:

80% chance to win with 300% return. 20% chance to lose 100%. Expected gain for each round is 0.8 \* 3 + 0.2 \* 0.0 = 2.4 (+120% expected value!).

However, despite this high expected value of each round, if you bet 10 times, reinvesting your returns, you have a 1 - 0.8\^10 = 89% chance of losing everything (because if the 20% chance happens once you‚Äôre done and you need a win to happen every time you bet since you‚Äôre reinvesting all winnings).

What's going on here?

This is the problem of arithmetic vs geometric means.

Let's take a less extreme example.

Imagine a trade where 50% chance of gaining 20% and 50% chance of losing 20%.

The average arithmetic EV each round is 1.

The average geometric EV is lower, at 0.9797.

This makes sense, given that if you win a round and then lose around, you don't go back to 1, you go to 0.96.

The discrepancy between 1 and 0.9797 is what I'd like to call the ""volatility tax"".

# Moral of the Story

When betting, you want to fractionalize your bets and bet simultaneously. The more fractional your bets, the more your returns approach the arithmetic mean, which is generally higher than the geometric mean.

When you bet your whole portfolio each time, you expose yourself to the volatility tax with much worse outcomes.

If there's a 0 outcome, then there's a very chance you lose everything after a series of bets where you reinvest your whole portfolio.

If you want to dive further into fractional betting, another important concept is how you size your fractional bets based on the estimate win-loss parameters.

A popular way of sizing is through the Kelly Criterion.

# Supplementary Information

The arithmetic EV for one round is (outcome\_1 \* chance\_1 + outcome\_2 \* chance\_2).

The geometric EV for one round is (outcome\_1 \^ chance\_1 \* outcome\_2 \^ chance\_2).

Observant readers will realize that if there's a 0 outcome for the geometric EV case, then it's always 0. This is a known problem for the geometric EV equation and you can resolve this in a few ways:

* If any value is zero (0), one is added to each value in the set and then one is subtracted from the result.
* Blank and 0 values are ignored in the calculation.
* Zero (0) values are converted to one (1) for the calculation.

The stock plunged 20% in extended trading.

Here‚Äôs how the company did:

Earnings per share: 8 cents, adjusted, vs. 6 cents expected by analysts, according to LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv.

Revenue: $1.36 billion vs. $1.38 billion expected, according to LSEG.

Global Daily Active Users: 414 million vs. 412 million expected, according to StreetAccount.

Average revenue per user: $3.29 vs. $3.33 expected, according to StreetAccount.


Snap has struggled to rebound from the downturn in the digital ad market, and has now reported six straight quarters of single-digit growth or sales declines. For the fourth quarter, revenue rose about 5% year-over-year to $1.36 billion from $1.3 billion a year earlier.

For the second consecutive period, Snap attributed some of the weakness to the war in the Middle East, which erupted in October beginning with Hamas‚Äôs attack on Israel.

‚ÄúWhile we are encouraged by the progress we are making with our ad platform and the improved results we are delivering for many of our advertising partners, we estimate that the onset of the conflict in the Middle East was a headwind to year-over-year growth of approximately 2 percentage points in Q4,‚Äù Snap said in a letter to investors.

Growth is expected to accelerate in the first quarter, but not quite as fast as analysts were expecting. Snap forecast sales for the quarter of $1.095 billion to $1.135 billion, representing about 11% growth at the midpoint of the range, which was $1.115 billion. Analysts were looking for revenue of $1.117 billion.

Daily active users for the first quarter will be 420 million, Snap said, slightly topping analyst estimates of 419.3 million.

Earlier this week, Snap said it would cut 10% of its global workforce, which equates to about 500 employees. A company spokesperson told CNBC in a statement that the cuts were intended to reorganize staff and ‚Äúreduce hierarchy and promote in-person collaboration.‚Äù In mid-2022, Snap eliminated about 1,000 employees, or 20% of its fulltime workforce.

Snap‚Äôs net loss for the quarter narrowed to $248.2 million, or 15 cents a share, which represents a 14% year-over-year decrease from $288.5 million, or 18 cents a share.

Snap said it expects an adjusted EBITDA loss between $55 million to $95 million in the first quarter, higher than analyst projections of $21.9 million. Last quarter, Snap issued an ‚Äúinternal forecast‚Äù for the fourth quarter instead of providing official guidance because of ‚Äúthe unpredictable nature of war,‚Äù referring to the Israel-Hamas war.

Snap on Tuesday disclosed sales its its Snapchat+ subscription service for the first time and said it had an annualized revenue run rate of $249 million in 2023. The service now has 7 million subscribers, up from five million in the previous quarter. Snap introduced the product in 2022, pitching it as a way for users to access early features. It came debuted that summer for $3.99 a month.

Snap‚Äôs growth in the fourth quarter lagged larger digital ad rivals like Meta, Amazon and Alphabet, which all reported double-digit expansion in their advertising units.

Snap and Pinterest are ‚Äúmuch smaller companies that have struggled to build substantial ad businesses, Debra Aho Williamson, an industry analyst, told CNBC. ‚ÄúIn this environment, the big are getting bigger,‚Äù

Last week, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel attended a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on child safety and technology alongside Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg,  X CEO Linda Yaccarino, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew and Discord CEO Jason Citron. Lawmakers grilled the executives, accusing them of failing to properly safeguard their respective platforms from child predators, among other concerns.

Shares of the company rose more than 1% in extended trading.

Earnings per share: $10.36 adjusted vs. $9.75 expected

Revenue: $2.52 billion vs. $2.49 billion expected


Chipotle reported fourth-quarter net income of $282.1 million, or $10.21 per share, up from $223.7 million, or $8.02 per share, a year earlier. The company said higher beef, produce and queso costs weighed on margins.

Excluding certain items, the burrito chain earned $10.36 per share.

Net sales rose 15.4% to $2.52 billion.

The company‚Äôs same-store sales rose 8.4%, beating StreetAccount estimates of 7.1%. Chipotle said that foot traffic rose 7.4% in the quarter, bucking an industry-wide trend of declining visits. Restaurant giants McDonald‚Äôs and Starbucks both reported traffic declines for the last three months of the year.

Chipotle‚Äôs sales also received a boost from a 3% menu price increase it implemented in October.

The company opened 121 new locations during the quarter.

Looking to 2024, Chipotle is forecasting full-year same-store sales growth in the mid-single digit range and plans to open between 285 and 315 new locations.

Those results would mark a 73.4% decrease in adjusted earnings per share compared to a year earlier as well as a 3.9% decline in automotive revenue. Ford‚Äôs 2022 fourth-quarter results included $41.8 billion in automotive revenue, net income of $1.3 billion and adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of $2.6 billion.

Aside from its earnings, Wall Street will be watching Ford‚Äôs 2024 guidance. Analysts expect it to be flat to slightly lower compared to 2023. However, Ford‚Äôs crosstown rival General Motors
 last week beat expectations for earnings guidance.

Analysts forecast Ford‚Äôs guidance to be roughly between $9 billion and $11 billion, according to investor notes from several analysts.

Ford in November forecast 2023 adjusted EBIT of $10 billion to $10.5 billion, about $1 billion lower than previous guidance in light of contract negotiations with the United Auto Workers union.

Wall Street also will be watching for any additional actions by Ford to offset increasing labor costs due to the new UAW contract, which the company said is expected to cost $8.8 billion over the life of the deal, ending in April 2028.

Ford is expected to face headwinds this year, including lower vehicle prices, warranty costs and continued losses for all-electric vehicles. Bright spots are expected to be its Ford Pro fleet unit and traditional Ford Blue internal combustion engine business.

(""Clean Harbors"") (NYSE:CLH)today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement with Gryphon Investors (""Gryphon"") to acquire HEPACO (""HEPACO""), a leading provider of specialized environmental and emergency response services in the Eastern United States, for $400 million in cash. The acquisition is expected to close in the first half of 2024, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions.

""HEPACO is a recognized leader in Field Services and its addition will accelerate the growth of our Environmental Services segment,"" said Eric Gerstenberg, Co-Chief Executive Officer of Clean Harbors. ""When providing emergency services, scale and rapid response capabilities are critical. HEPACO's geographic footprint, trained personnel and equipment fleet will enhance our existing business, enabling us to gain efficiencies and offer an even broader range of solutions. Field Services and emergency response have been a hallmark of Clean Harbors since our founding in 1980. We are confident that we can deliver strong shareholder value through this transaction in the years ahead.""

Headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, HEPACO has more than 2,000 customers, which it services through more than 40 regional locations in 17 states. Its primary offerings include field services, environmental remediation and emergency response services.

On an adjusted basis, HEPACO is expected to generate full-year 2023 EBITDA of approximately $36 million on $270 million of revenues. Clean Harbors expects the acquisition to generate cost synergies of approximately $20 million after the first full year of operations, which equates to a post-synergy acquisition multiple of 7.1 times. Clean Harbors expects to fund the acquisition through available cash and the issuance of some additional debt financing.

Mike Battles, Co-Chief Executive Officer of Clean Harbors, said, ""The acquisition of HEPACO aligns with our Vision 2027 long-term strategic plan for driving growth through a continued focus on value creation across all areas of our business. We see an excellent cultural fit with our two organizations that should help ensure the success of this acquisition. HEPACO has demonstrated a commitment to safety, environmental compliance and service excellence that matches our principles in these areas. We look forward to welcoming HEPACO's talented team to the Clean Harbors family.""

Key strategic benefits of the transaction for Clean Harbors include:

Complementary product offerings that increase the scale and capabilities of Clean Harbors' Field Services business;
Synergies in areas such as subcontracting, branch network, asset rentals, transportation and procurement;
Expansion of its rail and marine service capabilities through the addition of HEPACO's highly trained people and specialized equipment;

1201,Boeing's Next Crisis: Aerospace Workers Demanding 40% Pay Raise,801,1akb16h,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1akb16h/boeings_next_crisis_aerospace_workers_demanding/,232,"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-06/boeing-labor-strife-poses-next-big-risk-to-plane-production

* Machinists inspired by auto workers, Hollywood seek 40% raise
* Labor chief doesn‚Äôt want strike, ‚Äòbut we‚Äôre willing to do it‚Äô
* Union leaders will demand a 40% pay raise over three or four years, emboldened by a resurgent US labor movement, a scarcity of qualified aerospace workers and pressure on Boeing to stabilize work in its factories. 


(Bloomberg) -- Boeing Co. executives have spent the past month grappling with the aftermath of a near-catastrophe on an airborne 737 Max jet. As the US planemaker works through its latest crisis tied to manufacturing lapses, a new risk looms: a labor rift 10 years in the making.

Boeing‚Äôs largest union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, is still smarting over a 2014 deal that sacrificed pensions, locked in minimal raises and tied the hands of activists for a decade. Union leaders will demand a 40% pay raise over three or four years, emboldened by a resurgent US labor movement, a scarcity of qualified aerospace workers and pressure on Boeing to stabilize work in its factories. 

‚ÄúOur goal is to negotiate a contract that we as a union leadership and our members can accept,‚Äù said Jon Holden, president of IAM District 751, which represents 32,000 Seattle-area Boeing mechanics. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt take going on strike lightly. But we‚Äôre willing to do it.‚Äù

Holden sees a path to a successful deal with Boeing, he said in an interview. Even so, he‚Äôs prepared to follow the lead of auto workers in Detroit, writers and actors in Hollywood, and fellow machinists at Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc. in Kansas. Each emerged from walkouts last year with significant improvements in pay and other contract terms. 

A strike would shut down Boeing plants in Washington and Oregon, including assembly lines for its cash-cow 737 jets, crimping output after the current IAM contract expires in September. 

With talks set to start on March 8, labor tensions will add to the scrutiny on Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dave Calhoun. He already faces questions from lawmakers and investors over a spate of manufacturing problems ‚Äî the latest, an issue with holes misdrilled by Spirit ‚Äî while the Federal Aviation Administration has stepped up its oversight and capped production increases for the 737 until quality improves.

‚ÄúWe remain focused on working with our teams to strengthen quality across our operations,‚Äù Boeing said in a statement. ‚ÄúWe believe there‚Äôs a path to a new contract that addresses the needs and concerns of our people while maintaining our ability to compete in the global market.‚Äù

**10-Year Grudge**

The tactics Boeing used a decade ago to wrest pension concessions and limit pay increases to less than 1% on average loom large over the coming negotiations ‚Äî they were still in place when inflation soared post-Covid. 

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no loyalty because Boeing wasn‚Äôt particularly loyal,‚Äù said analyst Richard Aboulafia. ‚ÄúNow the labor markets have shifted radically, and they may stay that way for a long time.‚Äù

Back then, the aviation titan held crucial leverage over its Seattle-area workforce: a hulking new jet program known as the 777X. The company‚Äôs commitment to its century-old base was in question after Boeing had begun assembling 787 Dreamliners in South Carolina a year earlier. 

To force the IAM into contract talks that included freezing pensions, Boeing threatened to take the 777X program out of the Seattle area, inviting states around the US to compete for the factory. 

While local IAM leaders saw a bluff, senior union staff in Washington, DC, took over the talks and backed down. The narrowly approved deal that resulted preserved jobs, but the fixed-pension plan was ended, and pay raises totaled 4% over the next decade. 

‚ÄúThe anger that was experienced by our membership throughout that process in 2013 and 2014 is certainly palpable today,‚Äù Holden said. ‚ÄúI hear it any time I‚Äôm in the factory, and from all across the spectrum.‚Äù

As it prepares for the coming talks, Boeing doesn‚Äôt have a new plane to use as a bargaining chip, and with unemployment rates near record lows, it can‚Äôt threaten to shift manufacturing to the South. The company can ill-afford a work stoppage as it tries to steady its factories and suppliers, and return output to a steady, reliable pace. 

The union holds the upper hand, said Ken Herbert, analyst with RBC Capital Markets. ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs really a time to strike a deal that works for them, it‚Äôs now,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre going to be very, very aggressive.‚Äù

Boeing last week declined to give a financial outlook for this year, though it held to a target of generating free cash flow of $10 billion in 2025 or 2026, a goal at risk of being trashed by a prolonged work stoppage.

A labor deal could also be costly. Every 10% increase in machinist wages will drag down 2026 free cash flow by an estimated $260 million before price and productivity offsets, according to Sheila Kahyaoglu, an analyst with Jefferies.

There‚Äôs further uncertainty with US regulators digging deeper into Boeing‚Äôs quality practices after the structural blowout on Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 on Jan. 5. Its suppliers, who are gathered in the Seattle area this week, must also weigh whether to risk a continued ramp-up of production.  

The machinists intend to use their leverage to push for more than the usual economic concessions. Holden wants Boeing to reinstate thousands of quality inspections it suspended last decade. And he plans to press executives to commit to making planes in Seattle for decades. 

Boeing says it restored the inspections, and has increased the number of quality inspectors in its commercial division by 20% since 2019.

The union also plans to press for the return of defined-benefit pensions, lower out-of-pocket health costs and more flexibility around overtime. The IAM local has been studying the tactics employed last year by the United Auto Workers, including striking at selective locations, Holden said.

‚ÄúWe need jobs for 50 years, not four years,‚Äù Holden said.

There‚Äôs a link between Boeing‚Äôs labor pains and the quality lapses that prompted US regulators and airline customers to send auditors into the planemaker‚Äôs factories after the Alaska Airlines accident, said Cliff Collier, a consultant with decades of aerospace manufacturing experience. 

Boeing‚Äôs recent struggles are rooted in turnover, he said: an influx of inexperienced workers and managers since the pandemic, and labor tactics that led to an earlier exodus of seasoned staff, Collier said.

‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt get stupider,‚Äù Collier said. ‚ÄúPeople get overworked, people get pushed to do things they probably shouldn‚Äôt do.‚Äù",2024-02-06,0

- The company‚Äôs revenue for the quarter increased 20% year over year to $608.4 million.

- In a letter to shareholders, Palantir CEO Alex Karp said demand for large language models in the U.S. ‚Äúcontinues to be unrelenting.‚Äù

Here‚Äôs how the company did:

- Earnings per share: 8 cents adjusted vs. 8 cents expected by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv

- Revenue: $608.4 million vs. $602.4 million expected by LSEG

Palantir‚Äôs revenue for the fourth quarter ending Dec. 31, 2023, increased 20% year over year to $608.4 million, up from $508.6 million a year earlier. The company reported a net income of $93.4 million, or 4 cents per share, compared with $30.9 million, or 1 cent per share, in the year-ago quarter. In a letter to shareholders, Palantir CEO Alex Karp said the company‚Äôs expansion and growth ‚Äúhave never been greater,‚Äù especially as demand for large language models in the U.S. ‚Äúcontinues to be unrelenting.‚Äù Palantir has been rolling out its Artificial Intelligence Platform, or AIP, and Karp said the company carried out nearly 600 pilots with the technology in 2023, up from fewer than 100 in 2022.

‚ÄúOur results reflect both the strength of our software and the surging demand that we are seeing across industries and sectors for artificial intelligence platforms,‚Äù Karp wrote. Palantir said it expects to report between $612 million and $616 million in revenue during its first quarter, and it guided revenue for the full year between $2.65 billion and $2.67 billion. Wall Street was expecting $617 million during the first quarter and $2.66 billion in revenue for the full year.

Palantir, known for its defense and intelligence work with the U.S. government, said its U.S. commercial revenue grew 70% year over year. Palantir said its U.S. commercial customer count increased 55% year over year, growing from 143 customers to 221 customers. Last quarter, Palantir reported its fourth-straight quarter of profitability, which means it is now eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500.

The company EL, also announced an expansion of its profit-recovery plan, to include a restructuring program that will result in the cutting of 3% to 5% of its workforce. That could represent up to about 3,150 jobs.

>‚ÄúWe made progress in the first half across several strategic priorities, including reducing inventory in the trade of Asia travel retail, improving working capital, realizing higher levels of net pricing, and managing expenses with discipline,‚Äù said Chief Executive Fabrizio Freda. ‚ÄúWe are, encouragingly, at an inflection point.‚Äù The stock ran up 15.3% toward a five-month high in premarket trading, which would put it on track for the biggest one-day gain since it rocketed 17.9% on Nov. 3, 2011.

Sales declined 7.4% to $4.28 billion, reflecting challenges in Asia travel retail and softness in prestige beauty in China, but came in above the FactSet consensus of $4.19 billion. Among the company‚Äôs business segments, skin-care sales fell 10.5% to $2.17 billion, but beat the FactSet consensus of $1.95 billion.

>Regarding the job cuts, the company said the workforce-reduction plan is based on the number of positions it had as of June 30, 2023. Based on the company‚Äôs disclosure that it had approximately 62,000 to 63,000 employees worldwide at that time, a 5% reduction would suggest 3,150 employees would lose their jobs. Est√©e Lauder said it expects to record charges of between $500 million and $700 million once the restructuring program is fully implemented, for severance, contract terminations and asset write-offs. Gross benefits of the program are expected to range between $350 million and $500 million. Including the new restructuring program, the company expects its Profit Recovery Plan to yield $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion in operating profit.

Earnings per share: $2.95 adjusted vs. $2.82 expected

Revenue: $6.41 billion vs. $6.45 billion expected


The fast-food giant reported fourth-quarter net income of $2.04 billion, or $2.80 per share, up from $1.9 billion, or $2.59 per share, a year earlier.

Excluding the write-off of software that‚Äôs no longer in use, restructuring costs and other items, McDonald‚Äôs earned $2.95 per share.

Net sales rose 8% to $6.41 billion.

The chain‚Äôs global same-store sales grew 3.4% in the quarter, falling short of StreetAccount estimates of 4.7%, as its Middle Eastern sales struggled.

The international developmental licensed markets segment saw its same-store sales increase just 0.7%. McDonald‚Äôs said the division‚Äôs sales lagged as a result of the Israel-Hamas war.

McDonald‚Äôs has seen its Middle Eastern sales falter from boycotts after its Israeli licensee offered discounts for soldiers. The company has also had to shutter some locations temporarily to ensure employees‚Äô safety from protests. Boycotts also dented Starbucks‚Äô quarterly sales.

McDonald‚Äôs CEO Chris Kempczinski said the company is seeing sales in some markets outside the Middle East weaken as a result of the boycotts as well. He named Malaysia and Indonesia, both of which have majority Muslim populations. France, too, saw ‚Äúsome impact.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Company is monitoring the evolving situation, which it expects to continue to have a negative impact on Systemwide sales and revenue as long as the war continues,‚Äù McDonald‚Äôs said in a regulatory filing.

All other markets in the segment, like China and Japan, reported positive same-store sales growth for the quarter.

Domestic same-store sales rose 4.3%, about in line with expectations, helped by menu price hikes. The company also credited effective marketing and digital sales growth.

In the third quarter, McDonald‚Äôs said its U.S. traffic fell as low-income consumers pulled back their spending. It was the first sign that diners were beginning to shy away from the chain‚Äôs higher prices. McDonald‚Äôs has also been rolling out an improved version of its burgers nationwide, as it tries to convince customers that its prices are worth it.

The company‚Äôs international operated markets segment, which includes Canada, Australia and Germany, reported same-store sales growth of 4.4%, shy of StreetAccount estimates of 5.1%. Same-store sales shrank in France, however.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not happy with our performance in France right now,‚Äù Kempczinski said.

Pricing backlash contributed to France‚Äôs weaker sales, he added.

For 2024, McDonald‚Äôs reiterated its forecast from December that new restaurants will increase its systemwide sales growth by nearly 2%, excluding currency changes. The chain plans to open more than 2,100 new locations this year as part of a broader strategy to accelerate its expansion and reach more customers.

The company also said it will spend between $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion this year on capital expenditures. More than half of that money will go toward opening new restaurants in the U.S. and its international operated markets.

That being said, the company is still on track to hit the $8.00-$8.50 EPS in Fiscal 2024 and, while inventory in the last quarter, seemingly, hit what the company calls the ""top"", I think that there may be room for the company to run in conjunction with the economy staying strong and with a few cuts from the FEDS in the back half of this current year, thereby, at least conceptually, keeping the already relatively strong consumer, stronger.

The company boasts about $2 billion dollars of cash on hand, versus long term debt of about $16 billion (equating to about $400 million of interest expense every quarter) coupled with projected annual net cash flow of about $3.4-$3.67 billion in FY 2024.

In my view, the key is going to be revenue growth, which could lead to a higher premium to that of the investor benchmark (The S&P 500), which I believe looks achievable with the ""reset"" the company had two-four quarters ago. Therefore, while I am not necessarily a big individual stock investor (as most of my posts are buy the SPY and FLY, as, empirically, it is the safest and sounded way to invest), in looking at this one over the past few weeks, I am of the belief that, assuming EPS hits $8.20 per share at a 20x multiple this year, that would put fair value of shares @ $164.00 versus the current price of $145.49 as we sit here today (that equates to about an 11.2% gain). I should note that the company also pays a safe dividend of $4.40 per share / 3.2% / $1.931 billion.

Further, as we have seen with the likes of other big names that have been undervalued and are of quality, when these names start to run, the FOMO and ""computers"" seem to buy, pushing valuations even higher and, again, in looking at this quality name, I am of the belief that the same thing may be in the process of happening here.

Curious to get the communities feedback on this one and thank you, ahead of time, for reading my commentary.",2024-02-05,0

1223,Netflix (NFLX) DCF Analysis,70,1aiol8j,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1aiol8j/netflix_nflx_dcf_analysis/,16,"***Note: Not Financial Advice***

# Introduction:

NFLX prices dropped to their 5Y lowest in 2022 when they announced their first quarter in years when the number of subscribers had fallen. This was accompanied by other media companies dipping their toes into streaming services for the first time. It seemed that investors believed the golden era of NFLX dominance was over. However, NFLX made certain changes such as paid-sharing and ad-tier making radical changes to adapt to the situation on the ground quickly. The recent release of earnings results displays that NFLX's efforts are paying off and NFLX has solidified its position in being the leader to capture the streaming market.

# Revenue:

Beyond paid sharing and ad-tier subscription, how NFLX sees its revenue and subscribers growing is through improving the value of their offering. They want to offer diversity (Live Entertainment like WWE). NFLX has also begun receiving some of their competitors' content as NFLX is the only one with sufficient reach to deliver the full value of the IP e.g. HBO‚Äôs Suits. NFLX broadcasted it and revived Suits. Streaming services like HBO Max ([SOURCE](https://www.indiewire.com/gallery/removed-hbo-max-movies-shows-warner-bros-discovery-merger-list/)) and Disney, are removing shows (Band of Brothers, How I met your Mother) and licensing them to NFLX to avoid paying residuals. NFLX can scoop these shows up as they have sufficient reach to truly utilize the value of the IPs that were removed.

I assumed that the revenue per subscriber from both ad-tier and non ad-tier is the same, the difference in sales price is made up by the revenue from advertisers. So both ad-tier and non ad-tier subscribers are lumped together in my forecast.

The churn rate was taken from ([SOURCE](https://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-wins-streaming-wars-this-chart-shows-why-2024-1#:~:text=This%20data%20comes%20to%20us,customers%20are%20with%20the%20product)). I assumed that it took another 4 years for the churn rate to tick back down, the churn rate is slightly higher for consumers that are either still trying out ad-tier or are affected by paid-sharing. To avoid being overly granular when making assumptions about consumer's consumption habits, I assumed that the perpetual churn rate remained constant at historic amounts.

When forecasting the number of subscribers, opting for less granularity I forecasted subscribers as a whole without distinction for whether they are old or new subscribers and the churn rate applies to all subscribers as a whole.

The growth in subscribers is fueled by better content offerings, the streaming services market getting more efficient, and marketing. As NFLX continues offering more exclusive high-quality content, this incentivizes people to subscribe to NFLX. This is further fueled by certain competitor selling their IPs to NFLX due to the cost of these shows (Residuals) being higher than the benefit of these shows. As NFLX continues improving its strong branding, it will eventually build a strong enough reputation as a contender for being on consumer‚Äôs TV when streaming services completely overtake Linear Networks.

‚Äúour engagement is a bit impacted by our paid sharing. Think about it like fewer households using the same account. So, as those folks spin off and get their own accounts and we win them over with our programming, that will normalize and continue to grow.‚Äù - 2023 Q4 Earnings Conference.

I assumed that in the first 3 years of my forecast, the rate of subscriber increase tended higher before tapering back down and then a slight increase in rate due to the streaming and liner network market getting more efficient.

When forecasting Annual Revenue/Subscriber, as NFLX's main underserved markets lie in Asia and other less wealthy countries and management sees paid-sharing as a sort of quasi-price increase, I‚Äôd assumed that prices increase at a slow rate before increasing at the perpetual inflation rate.

# 

# Cost:

When forecasting COGS, COGS mainly consists of the amortization of acquired content. Opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages as I assumed that management continues their current pace of spending.

When forecasting Marketing, I assumed that marketing would remain constant for the first half of my forecast before tapering downwards slightly as NFLX gains a strong brand so there is less need for advertising.

When forecasting R&D and G&A, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.

# WACC:

RFR (1M Avg) = 4.03%

Beta ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NFLX/)) = 1.28

Stable Market ERP ([SOURCE](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/ctryprem.html)) = 4.60%

COE = 9.92%

NFLX is rated ‚ÄúBBB‚Äù ([SOURCE](https://cbonds.com/news/2433501/))

BBB Bond yield = 5.41%

Marginal Tax Rate = 21.00%

AT-COD = 4.27%

Stock Price (5D Avg) = $566.24

Shares O/S = 432.76M

Market Value of Equity = 245046.02M

Weighted Average Maturity of debt = 4 Years.

FY23 Interest Expense = 699.83M

Market Value of Debt = 14882.36M

%Debt = 5.73%

%Equity = 94.27%

%WACC = 9.60%

# CapEX, D&A and Content Acquisiton:

When forecasting CapEX and D&A, opting for less granularity I assumed it as a % of historic averages.  


When forecasting Content Acquisition, as management has stated that they intent on spending 17B on content acquisition for FY24, so I forecasted FY24 as such. For the high growth period, I assume that NFLX has to keep up content acquisition in line with historic in order to keep remaining attractive to new subscribers. Beyond the high growth period, I assumed that NFLX will get more capital efficient and reinvest negative amounts given that the streaming market is now significantly more efficient and there is less need to constantly feed money into content acquisition endlessly. 

&#x200B;

# Conclusion:

Ultimately, in base case I value NFLX at $371.71 per share. NFLX's nearest competitor Disney is having troubles focusing solely on streaming due to the major restructuring of their core business operations that has to be done, which may cannibalise or hinder their progress. I believe that NFLX's intrinsic value could be significantly be higher due to their dominant position in the streaming market. However, in order to forecast NFLX nearer to its current market price at about $560 would require making very bold assumptions such as the fall of a few streaming services that leads to mass migration of subscribers into NFLX or the accelerated decline of Linear Network.

1224,Interest Rate Resistant Sector Specific Inflation,20,1ai8r1o,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ai8r1o/interest_rate_resistant_sector_specific_inflation/,24,"Is the market still pricing in rate cuts as stocks go to record highs? 

Are non stock comp workers primed to demand pay increases, as their companies pull in massive profits, and as personal costs continue to heighten? 

As stock comped workers continue to accrue more wealth, and lower class continues to take on debt (inc. non forgivable student debt), has there ever been more of a pronounced have and have-not gap?

Will large companies continue to dominate their industry space? Has industry ever been as consolidated as it is today? How many wealthy people do you hear about working for smaller companies? How many smaller companies are left with acquisition and consolidation happening all the time?

Are raised interest rates having any effect on aforementioned large, industry consolidated companies with huge profit margins? As when you own a large slice of the market for essential goods, you can simply raise prices, and they will be paid. Biden admin recently addressed this for the grocery corps. But grocery, shipping, and producers have heavily consolidated in recent years, as have most industries.

With the recent progress of tech, there is big efficiencies gained by industry consolidation. See amazon. But those industries also attain market, employment and regulatory control with their resources. And jobs continue to be ""de-skilled"" by efficiency and automation, which is used as a reason to keep pay low. 

I'm not sure what this all means for the economy or the market. I've been telling everyone for years that it's a strange but incredibly bustling time for US hegemony in the world. I should have believed my own thought in terms of the market. But I tend to skew overly pragmatic. 

I did pretty well recently, as my 200 share short @ 230 on Tesla finally started to pay off. It seems like the AI hype is a ticking time bomb. But tech companies like meta are making so much money they can throw billions into speculation plays without a worry. They seem to actually have no choice but to do this.

Where do things go from here? Has there become sector specific, interest rate resistant inflation which is eating away at the pillars of the economy?",2024-02-03,0

1228,Reddit picks New York Stock Exchange for delayed IPO,794,1ahx1og,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ahx1og/reddit_picks_new_york_stock_exchange_for_delayed/,307,">Reddit is planning an initial public offering and the New York Stock Exchange won the listing, the Wall Street Journal has reported. The San Francisco-based social media company confidentially filed offering paperwork with the US Securities and Exchange Commission in 2021, it had said in a blog post back then. However, plans were put on hold amid a challenging business climate and aligning with the broader trend of delayed IPOs in the tech sector. It is expected to unveil the filing as soon as later this month and will name NYSE as its exchange, according to the WSJ report. The listing is a coup for the NYSE in its competition with Nasdaq for high-profile IPOs.

>In 2023, the number of IPOs on US exchanges annually increased by 42 per cent, but IPO proceeds grew by more than 160 per cent, driven by several large high-profile listings, an EY report said in January. There were seven IPOs in 2023, which raised more than $500 million, compared with only four in 2022, it added. Technology and health care continued to lead the US IPO deal count. Across sectors, investor preferences have continued to gravitate towards companies with greater scale and profitability, EY reported. ‚ÄúThe market backdrop for IPOs has improved significantly over the past few quarters: valuations are up, volatility is down, inflation may be corralled, and interest rates could begin ticking down,‚Äù the consultancy said.

>Reddit is considering feedback from early meetings with potential investors in its IPO that it should consider a valuation of at least $5 billion, Bloomberg reported. The online discussion platform has been looking to capitalise on the attention it gained when its WallStreetBets forum became a hot spot for individual investors who rallied around GameStop and other stocks. Founded in 2005, Reddit has raised $1.3 billion from private investors so far, including support from Silicon Valley heavyweights such as Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz. Fidelity led Reddit‚Äôs Series F raise in 2021, at a valuation close to $10 billion, although it later marked down the value of its holdings in the company by 41 per cent. The company could potentially have been valued as much as $15 billion in an IPO then, Bloomberg reported in 2022. Steve Huffman, chief executive and co-founder of Reddit, acknowledged in a discussion with users last year that the company had stalled its IPO plans to move closer to profitability. Reddit had more than 70 million daily active unique visitors as of October, according to its website. It became a darling of the so-called meme-stock era after a forum on the site, WallStreetBets, jolted the stock market.

""User is protected with cash collateral, your loaned shares are covered at a minimum of 100% with cash collateral so that you're fully protected - even if Wealthsimple or borrower's go under""

Does this mean that the risks of the borrower going bankrupt and the lender loosing money is not a possibility with Wealth simples lenders options?",2024-02-02,0

Even so, isn‚Äôt it kind of mind boggling that DDS has a bigger market cap than M and that DDS is bigger than JWN and KSS put together? I feel like that‚Äôs crazy.

1239,Amazon stock analysis: Why it's my only holding in my portfolio,210,1ah1ift,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ah1ift/amazon_stock_analysis_why_its_my_only_holding_in/,195,"I'm more bullish on Amazon today than I was two days ago. Even though their stock price has increased by 6% in after markets. I think Amazon is valued less today than before their earnings. Their earnings were that good. I'll share with you my thoughts on Amazon and why my investing portfolio will change form 80% Amazon and 20% Google to 100% Amazon the second the market opens.

Let's have a look at all their revenue streams very briefly.

AWS. Cloud computing. In the words of Andy Jassy: a technology that will change businesses around the world with the same amount of impact the invention of electricity had on businesses. Businesses are only just now starting to adopt. We are still early in the early phases of cloud computing. AWS hit 90 billion in sales this year. And their last two quarters AWS had an operating income of 30%. AWS is getting more reasons to adopt and more reasons to increase spending by their customers due to the many AI solutions it offers to companies. It's safe to say AWS will hit 100 billion in revenue next year and that this will bring in around 30 billion in operating income. Many people are scared that AWS will have their customers stolen by Azure. Firstly, 90% of the cloud engineers I talk to, prefer AWS. Secondly, it costs a ton of money to set up cloud infrastructure for businesses. Why would they throw all their money away and spend this once again to make a switch to a different cloud provider. The majority of the current customers Amazon has aren't going anywhere. You can basically look at it as a subscription. Lastly on AWS, AWS has 6 times more server capacity than the next 12 competitors combined.

Advertising. Many people tend to forget how big Amazon advertising is. It generated $47 billion in the last twelve months and it's growing at 27% year on year. That means if there are 3 more years of 25% growth we are nearing an other nearly 100 billion revenue stream. And although we don't know their margins on advertising we know nearly certainly that it's generating higher profit margins than Meta or Google due to the fact that Amazon advertising is way more targeted. Oh you're looking at Amazon.com to buy a BBQ? Here's and advertisement of a BBQ. The cost per click on those type of ads will be very high.

Warehouse and logistics. This is the least sexy side of the business, but because of the amount of revenue it's still up there potential wise. Amazon online stores and third party sellers generated $410 billion in revenue in 2023. Amazon is the leader in logistics robotics. This has not only been told by Amazon, but this was dropped in the FedEx earnings call a few quarters back. Amazon is the company that will offer the best solutions as of now. They will most likely first fulfill their own needs and afterwards export their robotics to other parties for profit although now we are getting way ahead of ourselves as Amazon still hasn't impacted their own margins. Fulfillment cost used to hover around 27% of the product sales in 2020. After Covid, Amazon invested heavily in infrastructure for logistics. This increases maintenance and the need of personnel. Also they grew too much and too fast decreasing their margins. Their fulfillment cost was 31% of product sales in 2021, 35% in 2022 peaking at 37% in Q1 2023 and now ending Q4 2023 at 34% averaging once again 35% of the net product sales being the cost of fulfillment for the full year of 2023. But we see a decrease. Amazon went from 37% in Q1 2023 to now 34% in Q4 2023. This may not seem like a lot but when we are talking about such big numbers that this has significant impact. If Amazon would get their total fulfillment cost percentage compared to net product sales down to 33% for a full year this would leave Amazon with an extra 6 billion operating income. If Amazon would get the percentage down to 30% this would mean $13.5 billion more operating income than FY2023. If Amazon would get back to their previous 27%. This would mean a total of $21 billion more operating income. And keeping their current price to operating cash flow of 20 in mind (which is low compared to the historic mean of 27) an increase of $21 billion in a year means an increase of $420 billion in market cap. Keeping automation in mind I think they should have little trouble getting back to their old percentage of 27% in the next three to five years.

Amazon Prime, now the majority of prime members are coming from the US, Europe is only just now receiving prime content from their own country and advertisements to subscribe to prime. I'm located in the Netherlands we had a company that is comparable to Amazon for online products for here and Belgium way before Amazon arrived here. Amazon has been in the Netherlands since 2014 but they are just now completely blowing the competitor out of the water. Since one year me and many others are only using Amazon and now we are seeing ads to subscribe to prime. Subscribing to prime is only valuable if you actually make use of the logistics side of things. But it helps if prime has other things to offer as well. That's where we get to my next point. Prime video is partnering up with lots of famous people here to make Prime content. And the content isn't bad at all. That prime content hasn't even been rolling out for 6 months. Prime is just in its infancy for many countries it has recently moved into. Like I said Amazon is here since 2014 but only now I'm seeing Dutch shows on Amazon prime and having lots of people ask me to share my prime account with them. I'm sure the Netherlands wont be alone in this, it will be all the other countries as well. And guess what Amazon prime just received an additional big revenue stream, advertising. All users will receive advertisements unless they pay a few dollars a month to not see ads. Netflix earns more per subscriber that's on the cheaper subscription with ads than it does on the more expensive subscription without ads.

Additionally Amazon International gets even less love. Understandable though it's less revenue and barley sees a positive quarter. But what people forget is that it took Amazon US 10 years to turn profitable. So why do we think that International will be any faster, especially considering there is less infrastructure in countries outside of the US. I'd say we might need to wait 15 years for those countries to start making a profit. So which countries have been operational for longer than 15 years? The United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Japan, China and Canada. Which countries have been operational for less than 15 years? Italy, Spain, Brazil, India, Mexico, Netherlands, Singapore, Australia, Turkey, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, Poland, Egypt and Belgium. We don't only need time for Amazon to build out the infrastructure. The middleclass in many of these countries is still growing which will increase activity in buying. And lastly, we need to give Amazon time to make Amazon prime subscription a valuable subscription in these countries by adding local content to Prime Video.

Amazon infrastructure, like I previously mentioned AWS has 6 times the server capacity compared to the next 12 competitors. Amazon is spending by far the most on renewable energy sources. They spent $2.5 billion on renewable energy, all to power their delivery vans and their servers. Although it may not seem huge but generating their in house electricity is bound to save them billions in the long run. Also Amazon is making their own chips for their AWS servers, they don't depend on a different party to be able to deliver. This in turn also increases their margins.

Lastly, Amazon is not sitting still. They have Amazon Gaming, Project Kuiper which has 3.000 satellites in orbit, they are making a plan to revolutionize the healthcare system and make it more cost and time efficient. They say in their call that they are still investing money to look for the next big pillar of Amazon, something that will be as big as AWS, advertising or Prime. They're not sitting still.

Okay story wise, I might have convinced you by now. But you could say, this is all a bunch of promising words. What about their valuation? Due to the fact Amazon invests a lot of their cash flow Amazon has usually been valued based on their price to operating cash flow. If we take the current after market price of Amazon of $169. Their current price to operating cash flow is at 20.6. This is 15% lower than what it was 2 days ago and this is 35% lower compared to their historical median price to operating cash flow of 27. Now this doesn't per se have to mean they will ever get back to that median price to operating cash flow so lets look at some different valuation methods. Remember Paypal was attractive to many people because it was ""only at a PE of 30"" instead of the usual 60. So lets keep on looking.

In Q4 of 2023 alone Amazon produced $30 billion free cash flow. Now Q4 is always a record quarter so we can't multiply this by 4. Q3 of 2023 Amazon had a free cash flow of $10 billion. This was still a quarter where many of their cost saving initiatives hadn't yet fully come to fruition, so although it was a much better quarter than Q2 which generated 6 billion in free cash flow. I'm very certain that Q3 free cash flow will be more in line with upcoming quarter. If we multiply 10 billion by 3 and 30 billion once. That's a free cash flow of 60 billion. This would be their free cash flow in 2024 if they don't grow, don't further increase margins and don't continue to lessen their investing of cash flow. If we take a quite reasonable (in my opinion) price to free cash flow of 30 times we see that Amazon stock should be valued at 1800 billion market cap. That's pretty much where the marketcap is at right now. Although I'm a firm believer that Amazon will grow in 2024. Let's not forget they are giving all their prime members ads from now on, or the ability to pay more for no ads. This alone will generate around 2 billion free cash flow in my estimation. Other than that I'm expecting Amazon to grow it's already existing revenue streams further, increase its margin further and decrease CAPEX. Which should result in record free cash flow in 2024. I'm estimating 12 billion in Q1, 13 billion in Q2, 15 billion in Q3 and 38 billion in Q4. Now I would love to tell you that these estimations are highly calculated by me and a pack of mathematicians. But I'll have to disappoint you and say that it's not. I've been doing estimates on Amazon every quarter based on the trends I see in the numbers and the story I pair with it. I have been quite spot on with the numbers so far. If my estimation would be reasonably close it would mean a market cap of 2.340 trillion, an increase of 34% at a price to free cash flow of 30 or an increase to a market cap of 2.730, an increase of 57% at a price to free cash flow of 35. Do note Microsoft is valued at 40 times price to free cash flow. And although I think Amazon and Microsoft should be valued similarly I find it hard to justify a price to free cash flow of 40 or more if you're not growing cash flow above 20% YoY.

We could also disassemble the components of Amazon and value these components with the price to sales of a company that offers similar services. To some people this might be a bit more hocus-pocus but I like doing this to see where Amazon stands in the market compared to other stocks. I'm using price to sales in this example because sadly we do not know the operating income on Amazon advertising and on Amazon Prime.

AWS had a total sales in FY 2023 of $90 billion. Lets pair this with the price to sales of Microsoft of 13 times. Resulting in AWS having a marketcap of $1,170 billion.

Amazon advertising has a total sales in FY 2023 of $47 billion. Lets get the average price to sales of two companies for this one. Google of 6 times price to sales and Meta of 8 times. Thus we multiply by 7. Resulting in Amazon advertising having a marketcap of $329 billion. Even though Amazon advertising has higher margins and is growing faster than Google and Meta.

Next up Amazon Prime had a total sales of $40 billion in FY 2023. Lets pair this with the price to sales of Netflix of 7.5. Resulting in Amazon Prime having a marketcap of $300 billion.

Lastly Amazon online stores, physical stores and logistics services offered to third party sellers generated a total revenue of 392$ billion in FY 2023. Lets take a price to sales of 0.70 based on the price to sales of Walmart at 0.71 and the price to sales of FedEx at 0.69. Resulting in a market cap of $274 billion dollars.

If we calculate all the components together we have a total market cap from Amazon of 2.073 trillion. An increase of 18.5% form the current prices. And this is based on historic number, not forward looking. Similarly when using the price to operating cash flow Amazon had two days ago of 23 we see that Amazon's stock is valued at a 15% cheaper price now than just two days ago. Supporting the argument that Amazon is more less 15% undervalued based on current prices, not forward looking expectations. This is why I moved my Google position into Amazon. As Google is looking undervalued by 15% on forward looking prices, but Amazon is looking undervalued by the same amount based on historic prices. Meaning if we expect Amazon to do slightly better in the future Amazon is a better buy than Google.

TLDR: I think Amazon is undervalued by 15% based on historic numbers. Forward looking though, I expect Amazon to be more less undervalued by around 30% - 50% based on end of on end of FY 2024 numbers. This is based on how well they execute increasing their margins, decreasing CAPEX and continuing their business trends growth wise.",2024-02-02,0

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

While Cook‚Äôs remarks on Thursday did not include many details, they did indicate that Apple wants to compete with Microsoft, Google, Amazon, OpenAI and other technology companies working on cutting-edge AI models that can generate text and images.

‚ÄúAs we look ahead, we will continue to invest in these and other technologies that will shape the future,‚Äù Cook said during a call with analysts. ‚ÄúThat includes artificial intelligence where we continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort, and we‚Äôre excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year.‚Äù

Generative AI started drawing significant attention from technology companies and investors starting in 2022, after OpenAI released ChatGPT and image generators rapidly improved. Apple did not announce an advanced AI model last year, although the company has long invested in similar machine learning technology in its chips and software, which can, for example, identify people or pets inside photographs.

Apple typically announces new software in June at its annual developer‚Äôs conference, WWDC. Last year, the company announced an autocorrect feature for the iPhone keyboard based on a transformer-based language model, which shares the same underlying technology as GPT. But Apple never used the phrase ‚Äúartificial intelligence‚Äù during the presentation, preferring the more academic term ‚Äúmachine learning.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet me just say that I think there‚Äôs a huge opportunity for Apple with Gen AI and AI, without getting into more details and getting out in front of myself,‚Äù Cook said.

A Zoom spokesperson confirmed the cuts amount to less than 2% of the company‚Äôs workforce.

‚ÄúWe regularly evaluate our teams to ensure alignment with our strategy,‚Äù the spokesperson told CNBC in a statement. ‚ÄúAs part of this effort, we are rescoping roles to add capabilities and continue to hire in critical areas for the future.‚Äù

Zoom said the layoffs are not companywide, and added that it will continue to hire for roles in artificial intelligence, sales, product and across operations in 2024.

The cuts at Zoom were first reported by Bloomberg.

As of Thursday, more than 100 tech companies have laid off about 30,000 employees to start the year, according to layoffs.fyi. January was the busiest month for job cuts in the industry since March.

Last month, Microsoft
 cut 1,900 positions in its gaming division; Google
 said it‚Äôs eliminating hundreds of roles across the company; and Amazon
 laid off employees across its Prime Video, MGM Studios, Twitch and Audible divisions.

In addition to Zoom, cloud software vendor Okta
 announced a downsizing on Thursday, telling employees that it‚Äôs laying off 400 staffers, or about 7% of its workforce.

Zoom exploded in popularity at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic as workers turned to the video-conferencing platform to stay in touch with colleagues, friends and family. But as the pandemic subsided and many workers returned to in-person roles, Zoom‚Äôs stock has stumbled.

Zoom shares are down about 10% this year and have dropped almost 90% from their record high in October 2020.

Last February, Zoom cut around 1,300 workers, or about 15% of its workforce, as the company braced for the ‚Äúuncertainty of the global economy,‚Äù CEO Eric Yuan said at the time. The cuts in 2023 hit every organization across Zoom.

Meta is projected to report revenue growth of 22% as the online advertising market continues to recover from a brutal 2022, when soaring inflation and rising interest rates forced brands to reel in spending.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg attributes advances in artificial intelligence to improvements in the ad business, which is growing faster than rival Google. In Alphabet‚Äôs earnings report on Tuesday, the company said Google ad revenue increased 11% from a year earlier, slower expansion than analysts were expecting.

Part of Meta‚Äôs financial recovery over the past year was driven by Chinese retailers, which have bolstered spending to reach users across the globe. Meta finance chief Susan Li most recently highlighted the significance of business from China in the company‚Äôs third-quarter earnings report in October. Li didn‚Äôt name specific companies, but fast-growing upstarts Temu and Shein, which originated in China, have been pouring money into ads on Facebook and Instagram.

While Meta has a very diverse base of advertisers, some analysts say the potential for Temu and Shein to pull back spending poses a risk because every point of growth matters for a company that saw revenue shrink for three straight quarters in 2022.

Zuckerberg, along with the top executives at TikTok, X (formerly Twitter), Snap and Discord, faced tough questioning from lawmakers on Wednesday. They accused the Facebook founder of ignoring the severity of child exploitation on the company‚Äôs family of apps.

Parents attending the hearing lambasted Meta and other companies for what they allege are insufficient safety and design measures that have caused mental health issues for their children and, in some cases, even resulted in their deaths.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for everything you‚Äôve all gone through. It‚Äôs terrible,‚Äù Zuckerberg told the parents in an emotional scene on Capitol Hill. ‚ÄúNo one should have to go through the things that your families have suffered.‚Äù 

Investors will also be looking for signs that Meta‚Äôs pivot to the metaverse is bearing fruit. The company has been burning billions of dollars a quarter to build out a virtual world that Zuckerberg has said is the future of computing. In total, the division has lost about $25 billion since the beginning of 2022, shortly after Zuckerberg renamed his company.

Analysts expect Reality Labs to show revenue of $762.8 million for the quarter and an operating loss of $4.26 billion, according to StreetAccount.

1255,2024 One Month Reflection,2,1agem31,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1agem31/2024_one_month_reflection/,10,"Coming into 2024 there were hopes of six rate cuts.  Institutions started positioning themselves into small caps in November and December thinking the rate cuts will drive small caps.  Tech had such a great year last year, but most of the gains were from losses in 2022.

Based on chairman Powell's remarks yesterday it is unlikely we see a rate cut in march.  That is when we started to see another selloff.  Besides the rate cuts probably not happening until May their is also risk in the regional banking sector when they start realizing the losses in commercial real estate. 

There is also instability in the Middle East which is affecting shipping.  Oil prices have not gone up yet due to this conflict.  As long as the conflict is contained and does not start to grow I don't see this being a big issue.  

Tech earnings started to come in and it has been a mixed bag so far.  SMCI is showing great strength from the AI boom.  AMD's Lisa SU said,‚ÄúWe are in the very early stages of the AI computing era, and the rate of adoption and growth is faster than any other technology in recent history‚Äù  Microsoft reported 30% growth in Azure revenue.

Based on this information the broader market should start to  do better around April leading into the May Fed meeting.  There is risk if we don't see the rate cuts in May which are not guaranteed.  I would stay out of the regional banks even if their are cuts due to the commercial real estate risk.  Hopefully this will not bleed over to ther areas of the economy.   Lastly I think tech will continue to outperform for at least a few years due to the early AI cycle.  This is going to lead to PC sales, data center, and cellular phone sales, to name a few that will see growth due to everyone upgrading for the AI technology.  Growth in the income will start to then reflect in the stocks.

1259,M&A Analysis: Silver Lake Acquisition of Qualtrics,0,1agc3ms,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1agc3ms/ma_analysis_silver_lake_acquisition_of_qualtrics/,1,"# Introduction:

Silver Lake acquired Qualtrics in an all-cash deal at a Transaction Enterprise Value of $12.5 billion or $18.15 per share. 

Qualtrics is an experience management software for both customers and employees.

employeeXM, Qualtrics helps administer digital surveys for employees. Collecting the data and creating easy ways to visualize it. They are especially useful for larger companies with larger data sets, using AI and deep learning to quickly aggregate the data into a few overarching themes.  


customerXM, Qualtrics helps administer qualitative surveys for digital customers. They are the VOC (Voice of Customers) allowing more open-ended questions and then Qualtrics uses text recognition to analyze the responses.

I did a DCF to quantify the potential gains for Silver Lake.

# Deal Rationale:

My belief of the deal rationale for Silver Lake is the large use of SBC by Qualtrics.  
41% of Qualtric's total cost was in equity or SBC. When a company is private, employees tend not to exercise options as the stock is illiquid so they would either sell back SBC or hold onto their stock options, so SBC is essentially a non-cash expense for Qualtrics.

&#x200B;

# Revenue:

When forecasting the number of customers, I got my numbers from the respective year‚Äôs 10-K. Given the large switching cost of porting data over and retraining employees to use a competitor‚Äôs XM software. I believe this allows Qualtrics to hold onto customers more easily and given the large number of distinguished customers that do use Qualtrics, it adds to Qualtrics‚Äô credibility helping to fuel the growth of Qualtrics. Given the improving macro factors, it catalyzes the growth for Qualtrics as firms begin growing, they need to process larger data sets of surveys from both customers and employees to effectively provide their goods and services. I assumed that the macro environment would take 2 years to clear up from 2022.  
  
When forecasting Annual Revenue/Customer, I assumed that the newer customers are committing to a lower-price, short-duration package so the Y/Y growth rate of Annual Revenue/Customers reduces during the period where there is larger customer growth.  
  
When forecasting Professional Services and Others, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic average.  


# Cost:

When forecasting COGS, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic average.  
  
When forecasting R&D, G&A, and Sales, I assume that Silver Lake wants to exit the investment within 5 years and will cut down R&D and headcount to a minimum.  
  
When forecasting Marketing, I believe marketing spend will decrease over time as the switching cost over to a competitor is high and Qualtrics becomes more well-known so there is less need to advertise Qualtrics.

# WACC:

RFR (1M Avg) = 4.00%  
US ERP ([SOURCE](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/ctryprem.html)) = 4.60%  
Beta ([SOURCE](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/xm/statistics/)) = 1.73  
COE = 11.96%

COD (1M Avg) = 7.60%  
Marginal Tax Rate = 21.00%  
AT-COD = 6.00%  
  
Given that Qualtrics is a private company, there is no available data for recent market prices. So I opted to use the book value of equity and liability when calculating weightage.  
  
BV Equity = 1904.02M  
BV Liability = 278.18M  
%Liability = 12.75%  
%Equity = 87.25%  
WACC = 11.20%   


# CapEX,D&A and SBC:

When forecasting CapEX, D&A and SBC opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of Historic average. 

# Conclusion:

Utimately, in my base case, I value Qualtrics at $25.43 per share. This would represent a 40.1% profit on Silver Lake's investment or Y/Y CAGR of 7.0%.

In my best case, I value Qualtrics at $30.07 per share. This would represent a 65.7% profit on Silver Lake's investment or Y/Y CAGR of 10.6%.

This means that Qualtrics would be an above-average investment when compared to the average private equity investment returns ([SOURCE](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040615/how-do-returns-private-equity-investments-compare-returns-other-types-investments.asp#:~:text=Private%20equity%20produced%20average%20annual,returns%20can%20be%20less%20impressive)), Silver Lake recognised the hidden value of Qualtrics.

They are massively, and it sounds like successfully, expanding production of SiC materials and devices. Gross margins on materials products seem to be quite good, and the entire SiC industry seems supply constrained at the moment. Yeah, EV production may slow momentarily, but does anyone really doubt the long term trend? I also find it likely that as SiC supply grows and costs come down with the sort of scale Wolfspeed is aiming for, there will be more and more SiC uses found/justified. Translation, TAM for SiC products is massively going up and to the right.

So we have a $4B market cap, well funded company ($2B in deposits from customers, plenty of cash on hand to fund manufacturing expansions, applying for gov funding from CHIPs act now) with proven track record demonstrating success in new 200MM boule height material manufacturing. Wolf is trading at ~4x revenue with near term plans to 4x (and then easily get to 10x) manufacturing capacity. No one said building out manufacturing is easy, but with each passing quarter they demonstrate more and more success on this front. The unique scale they are chasing should make them cost competitive with virtually anyone, and as the US focuses on near-shoring/onshoring critical infrastructure manufacturing, their competitive edge should only solidify.

Obviously, at the moment NVDA has superior technology and the current story for AMD's expected rise (an inevitable rise in the eyes of most) is that they'll steal future market share from NVDA. That they'll close the gap and capture billions of dollars worth of market share. Well, that might eventually happen, but I couldn't ignore these two differences during my research. 

The first is margins. NVDA is rocking an astounding 42% profit margin and 57% operating margin. AMD on the other hand is looking at an abysmal .9% profit margin and 4% operating margins. Furthermore, when it comes to management, NVDA is sitting at 27% of a return on assets and 69% return on equity while AMD posts .08% return on assets and .08% return in equity. Thats an insane gap in my eyes. 

Speaking to management there was another insane difference. AMD's president rakes home 6 million a year while the next highest paid person is making just 2 million. NVDA's CEO is making 1.6 million and the second highest paid employee makes 990k. That to me looks like greedy president on the AMD side versus a company that values it's second tier employees in NVDA. 

I've been riding the NVDA wave for nearly a decade now and have been looking at opening a defensive position in AMD, but those margins and the CEO salary disparity I found to be alarming at the moment. Maybe if they can increase their margins it'll be a buy for me, but waiting for a pull back until then and possibly a more company friendly President.",2024-02-01,0
1267,Is Starbucks in trouble?,41,1afvzo6,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1afvzo6/is_starbucks_in_trouble/,124,"**TLDR**: Most sources are aligned on boycotts having an impact on SBUX performance, some focusing on it more/less than others/attributing performance to other things. The real question is how long do we think the boycotts will last and does it make SBUX a bad investment medium term?  
**Sky News** reports boycotts being a contributing factor to its sales forecast being cut:

* Starbucks cut its yearly sales forecasts and missed market expectations
* The business was hit by staff walkouts and a dropping number of US occasional visitors
* Significant impact on traffic and sales in the Middle East due to the Israel-Hamas conflict
* Boycotts of the chain took place in the US
* Starbucks took legal action against Workers United for using its name and similar logo
* Protesters influenced by misrepresentation on social media
* Record revenue of $9.43bn was reported in its first 2024 fiscal quarter
* Sales outlook for the rest of the year was lowered as spending weakened in China and other markets

Had a quick scan on **NewsCord** to see what other publishers are saying and understand the longer-term impacts of boycotting on $SBUX:

* **RTE.ie** mentions that shares rose 4% after the bell, while Sky News reports that Starbucks cut its yearly sales forecasts and missed market expectations, indicating a more negative tone in the Sky News report
* **Quartz** portrays a different narrative by focusing on Starbucks reporting record revenue and lowering its sales outlook, while Sky News emphasizes the impact of staff walkouts, dropping number of US occasional visitors, and the Israel-Hamas conflict
* **MarketWatch**: Boycotts related to an ‚Äòerroneous‚Äô interpretation of SBUX‚Äôs stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict were to blame.
* **MarketWatch**: Customers and others on social media have called for a boycott against Starbucks after the union representing some employees at the chain expressed solidarity with Palestine
* **MarketWatch** mentions that boycotts related to an ‚Äòerroneous‚Äô interpretation of SBUX‚Äôs stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict were to blame, whereas Finbold does not cover this specific reason for the boycotts",2024-01-31,0

Let's take into consideration this scenario:

Company ""A"" has current price 105 USD.

I'm setting ""Sell Stop"" at 100 USD and there's plenty of buys/sells around this level - below and above (I think)

And now, the market is closed, price is still 105 USD and there's earnings release.

Earnings went terribly and after hours stock drops to 70 USD.

During this time I'm unable to modify or cancel my ""Sell Stop"" position (I'm using X-Trade Brokers - they're almost biggest in my country)

And now, the market opens at the next day and it starts from around 70 USD (it feels like there's small correction, but still there's huge gap)

And I don't understand why it works like this. 

I mean it feels unfair to me because if there was no artifical concept of closing market then my mechanism would trigger around 100 USD.

But the second unfair thing is that other actors can trade meanwhile I cannot cancel/modify my ""Sell Stop"" action (or maybe my broker sucks?)


Also I don't understand where my ""Sell Stop"" is registered

Is it just at my broker or the actual stock exchange?

I guess it is actual stock exchange because I'm unable to cancel this during off-hours, but on the other hand
if that was actual stock exchange, then why it doesn't trigger closer to 100 USD?

What I'm missing? **Why after hours trade seems to be some ""special"" and feels like it skips ""queue"" of actions?**",2024-01-31,0

*Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace. Job gains have moderated since early last year but remain strong, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation has eased over the past year but remains elevated.*

*The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee remains highly attentive to inflation risks.*

*In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.* ***The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.*** *In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in its previously announced plans. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.*

*In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.*

*Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Thomas I. Barkin; Michael S. Barr; Raphael W. Bostic; Michelle W. Bowman; Lisa D. Cook; Mary C.

McGrath RentCorp stock was climbing Monday as mobile storage company WillScot Mobile Mini Holdings agreed to acquire the business rental company in a $3.8 billion deal.

The 60% stock and 40% cash transaction is expected to close in the second quarter, the companies said in press release, subject to the approval of McGrath shareholders. When the deal is closed, McGrath stock holders will receive for each of their shares either $123 in cash or 2.8211 shares of WillScot Mobile Mini common stock.

‚ÄúThis combination provides McGrath customers and employees a platform for continued growth and success, while providing McGrath shareholders with immediate cash value as well as participation in the upside potential of the combined company,‚Äù McGrath Chief Executive Joseph Hanna said.

WillScot Mobile expects the combined company will generate around $700 million in annual free cash flow by the end of the first full year following closing.

The deal represents a 10.1% premium to McGrath‚Äôs closing price on Friday. Shares of McGrath were rising 10% Monday to $123.20, which would be a new closing high for the stock and its largest percentage increase since October 2022, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

The maker of weight loss drug Wegovy and diabetes drug Ozempic reported an increase in sales of 31% in Danish kroner and 36% at constant exchange rates (CER) to 232.3 billion kroner ($33.71 billion).

Full-year operating profit jumped by 37% in kroner and 44% at constant exchange rates to 102.6 billion kroner.

The Danish pharmaceutical giant said it expects sales growth this year of between 18% and 26% in CER terms, as demand surges for Wegovy and Ozempic, which contain the same active ingredient.

The company‚Äôs shares climbed by around 3.7% early on Wednesday morning to notch a new all-time high and take its market cap above $500 billion, before cooling slightly. The stock was up by 1.6% on the day at 9 a.m. London time.

The 2023 results were fueled by strong performance in the company‚Äôs diabetes and obesity care division, with obesity care in particular spiking by 154% at CER to 41.6 billion.

‚ÄúThe unmet needs in type 2 diabetes and obesity are growing by the day, and the rising prevalence of these closely related threats to global health has created surging demand for our GLP-1-based therapies,‚Äù Chairman Helge Lund and CEO Lars Fruergaard J√∏rgensen said in the earnings report.

‚ÄúThis has enabled us to reach more patients than at any point in our 100-year history, contributing to strong sales growth across North America and International Operations.‚Äù

The company also acknowledged that this had resulted in increased pressure on its supply chain, leading to ‚Äúperiodic constraints‚Äù across its portfolio as it struggled to keep pace with demand in 2023.

‚ÄúWe have responded by investing heavily in expanding our production capacity with the aim of serving millions more patients worldwide. In 2023 alone, we announced investments totalling more than DKK 75 billion in the expansion of our production sites across the globe,‚Äù the chairman and CEO said.

‚ÄúWith construction now underway on these projects, we strive to operate our existing facilities 24 hours a day, seven days a week, as we produce more of our life-changing medicines than ever before.‚Äù

Business model/revenue sources: they have 3 main revenue sources: direct-to-consumer (e-commerce), company operated stores, and services. Services means their other ventures like pop up stores, recommerce (selling 2nd hand lulu products) or factory outlet stores.  
Main reason i think this company is a buy rn is that i believe the streets are underestimating its product innovation. many equity researchers have calculated their new stores opening and increase in in-store sales numbers. but many has estimated new products very conservatively. men‚Äôs wear and especially sneakers market will drive stronger growth than many expect. the footwear market which Statista has estimated a total addressable market of about $100b worldwide, Nike alone holds about 25-30% of market share. Lululemon which is about 1/3 the size of nike, currently holds less than 1%. It would be easy to argue that this revenue source could increase to at least 3% of market share given its popularity based on amazon and google search trends.

Risk is that its priced very high, but i think the constant store openings will definitely hold up.

How can Alphabet lack a gifted visionary when clearly there are so many there?

Is most of this talent locked out of leadership positions? And I get it. Not every talented employee can be CEO, or run every important business. But shouldn‚Äôt they have a real path to lead and run those positions and the brightest of them win?

Its approachable interface and comprehensive communication tools, including text, voice, and video chat, have helped broaden its user base, fueling rapid expansion and a stronger market foothold.

Additionally, Discord's responsiveness to user preferences and ongoing innovation in platform enhancement resonate with the dynamic nature of digital communication. This positions the company favourably in a competitive and swiftly evolving market. Its emphasis on user privacy and security further enhances its attractiveness, particularly in today's climate where data protection is crucial.

From a financial standpoint, Discord demonstrates promising signs of a sustainable and scalable business model. The company's ability to attract and maintain a large, active user community opens doors for revenue growth, notably through premium subscriptions and strategic partnerships.

Therefore, I view Discord's IPO as an enticing investment avenue. Their strategic position in the digital communication realm, coupled with its potential for significant impact and leadership in the industry, bolsters investor enthusiasm for Discord's entrance into the public market in 2024.

Then there's **Turo**, founded in 2009 and headquartered in San Francisco, Turo has revolutionized the concept of car rentals with its peer-to-peer car-sharing platform. This innovative service allows private car owners to rent out their vehicles through an accessible online and mobile interface. This unique model not only provides car owners with an avenue to earn additional income but also presents renters with a more diverse and often more affordable range of vehicle options compared to conventional rental services.

Turo prides itself on its user-friendly platform, streamlining the process of listing, searching, and booking vehicles. The platform excels in offering convenience, a wide variety of choices, and accessibility, catering to an array of needs and preferences. From economical cars for daily use to luxury and unique models for special occasions, Turo accommodates a broad spectrum of requirements.

Having significantly expanded its operations across multiple countries, Turo offers a diverse array of vehicles. The company has carved a niche in the sharing economy with its innovative approach to car rentals, focusing on enhancing user experience and combining the strengths of community and technology to transform the traditional car rental landscape. As a result, Turo has emerged as a frontrunner in the car-sharing domain, continually adapting to the evolving demands of contemporary consumers.

> Why Turo Is a Prime IPO in 2024?

Investor enthusiasm for Turo's IPO in 2024 is fueled by the company's trailblazing role in the car-sharing economy and its potential for future expansion. As a leading figure in peer-to-peer car rentals, Turo capitalizes on the burgeoning trend of the sharing economy. This differentiates it from traditional car rental firms and aligns with a consumer shift towards more flexible and economical transportation options.

Turo harnesses the untapped potential of privately owned vehicles, offering owners a novel way to monetize their assets. This approach has broadened the car rental market, providing users with a greater variety of vehicles and personalized rental experiences. Turo's emphasis on a seamless user experience and customer satisfaction has further solidified its position in the market.

Investors are optimistic about Turo's scalability and growing user base, indicating robust market demand. The company's upward growth trajectory and the increasing acceptance of peer-to-peer services point to a bright future. Turo's adeptness in navigating various regulatory landscapes and adapting to different market conditions underscores its operational agility and resilience.

Considering these aspects, Turo's IPO represents a compelling opportunity for investors to align with a pioneering entity in the transformation of traditional car rental services. Turo's successful exploitation of technology to innovate within the automotive and transportation sectors marks it as an attractive investment prospect in an evolving economic environment.

---

So both Discord and Turo present themselves as noteworthy IPOs to watch in 2024, each representing a significant shift in their respective industries. Discord, transcending its initial gaming roots, has evolved into a comprehensive digital communication platform with a wide-reaching influence. Its focus on user experience, privacy, and continuous innovation positions it as a strong contender in the digital communication sector. The company's scalable business model and ability to adapt to a rapidly changing digital landscape make it a compelling investment choice.

Turo, on the other hand, stands at the forefront of the car-sharing economy, redefining traditional car rental concepts with its peer-to-peer model. The company's growth trajectory, combined with its innovative approach and ability to meet diverse consumer needs, highlights its potential for long-term success in the evolving transportation sector. Turo's expansion and the increasing popularity of peer-to-peer services underscore its potential as a lucrative investment in the changing dynamics of the automotive industry.

For you guys, these two companies are a great example of the type of stuff we're looking for in an IPO, they are the kind of innovative, forward-thinking businesses that not only adapt to changing market demands but also lead the way in transforming their industries!",2024-01-31,0

(NYSE: WMT) announced that it will conduct a split of its outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of 3:1. The stock split is part of Walmart‚Äôs ongoing review of optimal trading and spread levels and its desire for its associates to feel that purchasing shares is easily within reach. More than 400,000 associates participate in Walmart‚Äôs Associate Stock Purchase Plan today, which allows eligible associates to buy stock conveniently through payroll deductions and provides a 15% company match on the first $1,800 each year.

‚ÄúSam Walton believed it was important to keep our share price in a range where purchasing whole shares, rather than fractions, was accessible to all of our associates,‚Äù said Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Walmart. ‚ÄúGiven our growth and our plans for the future, we felt it was a good time to split the stock and encourage our associates to participate in the years to come. As Sam said, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre all in this together. That‚Äôs the secret.‚Äô‚Äù

For more than 60 years, Walmart has been focused on helping people save money and live better, including its 2.1 million associates worldwide. Walmart has focused on creating a path of opportunity for associates by offering good jobs and great careers, with continued investments in compensation, attractive healthcare, financial and educational benefits. As part of the benefits provided to its associates, Walmart has had an Associate Stock Purchase Plan for almost 30 years. Today‚Äôs stock split is just the latest action aimed at helping strengthen associates‚Äô financial health.

The shares to be issued in the stock split will be payable after market close on Friday, Feb. 23, 2024, for shareholders of record at the close of business on Thursday, Feb. 22, 2024. Shareholders will receive a distribution of two additional shares of common stock for each share held. Walmart's common stock will begin trading on a post-split basis at the market open on Monday, Feb. 26, 2024, under the company's existing trading symbol ‚ÄúWMT.‚Äù The stock split and final ratio were approved by Walmart's board.

The company expects that the stock split will increase the number of shares of Walmart‚Äôs outstanding common stock from approximately 2.7 billion shares to approximately 8.1 billion shares.

As a result of the stock split, proportionate adjustments will be made to the number of shares of Walmart's common stock underlying the company's outstanding stock awards and warrants; the number of shares issuable under the company's equity incentive plans and other existing agreements, as well as the exercise or conversion price, as applicable; the company‚Äôs common stock dividend; and the company‚Äôs authorized buyback programs. The company anticipates filing a Form 8-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission after the effective date to report an amendment to the company‚Äôs Restated Certificate of Incorporation effecting the stock split and reflecting a proportionate adjustment to the total number of authorized shares of company common stock.

EPS: $0.77 per share, adjusted, versus $0.77 per share expected

Revenue: $6.17 billion, versus $6.12 billion expected


For the first quarter, AMD said it expects about $5.4 billion in sales, plus or minus $300 million, while analysts were looking for revenue of $5.73 billion. AMD added that it expected all of its major businesses, including server and PC chips, to decline sequentially during the quarter.

Net income in the fourth quarter was $667 million, or $0.41 per share, versus $21 million, or $0.01 per share a year ago.

AMD makes graphics processing units, or GPUs, which are needed to train and deploy generative artificial intelligence models. While that market is currently dominated by Nvidia, AMD has said that its new AI chips introduced last year will challenge Nvidia‚Äôs H100 GPUs for some applications, and investors are looking for significant growth in the company‚Äôs data center segment over the next few years.

In October, AMD said it expected $2 billion in server GPU sales in 2024.

But historically, AMD‚Äôs main business has been central processors, or CPUs, for PCs and servers. Compared to AI chips, that part of the semiconductor industry has been flat or shrinking over the past few years, as PC sales have suffered post-pandemic.

Data center, which includes server CPUs and AI chips, rose 38% on an annual basis to $2.28 billion in sales. It‚Äôs now firmly AMD‚Äôs largest business and the company said that much of the increase in revenue was attributable to ‚Äústrong growth‚Äù for sales of its Instinct graphics processors, which are used for AI.

However, AMD‚Äôs overall performance in the business was in line with a $2.29 billion FactSet estimates for the Data Center business.

AMD‚Äôs client group, which is comprised mostly of chips for PCs and laptops, rose 62% year-over-year to $1.46 billion in sales, which the company said was boosted by recent chip launches.

Sales in AMD‚Äôs gaming segment, which includes ‚Äúsemi-custom‚Äù processors for Microsoft Xbox and Sony Playstation consoles, fell 17%. AMD blamed slower console sales, and said it expected semi-custom revenue to decline by a ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù double-digit percentage in the current quarter.

AMD‚Äôs embedded segment, which includes chips for networking, reported $1.1 billion in sales, down 24% on an annual basis.

CEO Laxman Narasimhan said in a statement that the chain faced ‚Äúheadwinds,‚Äù but the brand remains strong.

Shares initially fell in extended trading but recovered, rising about 2%.

Here‚Äôs what the company reported for its fiscal first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: 90 cents adjusted vs. 93 cents expected

Revenue: $9.4 billion vs. $9.59 billion expected


The coffee giant reported fiscal first-quarter net income of $1.02 billion, or 90 cents per share, up from $855.2 million, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier.

Excluding restructuring costs and other items, Starbucks earned 90 cents per share.

Net sales rose 8% to $9.4 billion. Global same-store sales increased 5%, falling short of StreetAccount estimates of 7.2%.

In North America, same-store sales also rose 5%, driven largely by customers spending more on their drinks and food.

Starbucks‚Äô fiscal first quarter encompasses the all-important holiday season. The chain usually nets billions of dollars in gift card sales, plus higher traffic fueled by its seasonal drink offerings and thirsty shoppers.

Outside of Starbucks‚Äô home market, the coffee chain reported international same-store sales growth of 7%, missing expectations of 13.2%.

China, the company‚Äôs second-largest market, reported same-store sales growth of 10%. However, the average ticket at its Chinese stores fell 9%.

The chain has seen increased competition from lower-priced rivals like Luckin Coffee, which have won over consumers as China‚Äôs economic recovery continues to lag.

The company‚Äôs Intelligent Cloud segment produced $25.88 billion in revenue, up 20% and above the $25.29 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. The grouping contains Azure cloud infrastructure, SQL Server, Windows Server, Nuance, GitHub and enterprise services.

Within that segment, revenue from Azure and other cloud services grew 30%. Analysts polled by CNBC had expected 27.7% growth, and the StreetAccount consensus was 27.5%. The metric for the previous quarter was 29%.

Revenue from the Productivity and Business Processes unit including Office productivity software, LinkedIn and Dynamics totaled $19.25 billion. That was up 13% and higher than the $18.99 billion StreetAccount consensus.

The More Personal Computing segment contributed $16.89 billion in revenue, up about 19% and more than the StreetAccount consensus of $16.79 billion. The segment comprises Windows, Surface, Bing and Xbox.

During the fiscal second quarter, Microsoft closed its acquisition of video game publisher Activision Blizzard, its largest deal ever. The company also announced custom cloud chips and started selling a $30 monthly Copilot artificial intelligence add-on to Microsoft 365 productivity software bundles.

But layoffs continued. Microsoft‚Äôs LinkedIn subsidiary cut around 700 jobs in October on top of the 10,000 announced earlier in the year. Last week, Microsoft said it‚Äôs eliminating around 1,900 employees in its gaming unit, or about 9% of headcount, following the Activision deal.

People who are suffering from severe pain but don't want to risk addiction to an opioid are closer to a new option for treatment.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals on Tuesday reported positive study results for its closely watched non-opioid painkiller. The drug lowered the moderate-to-severe acute pain reported by study volunteers, a sign it could be the first in a new class of painkiller to be approved for use.

But the experimental medicine is more likely to provide an alternative to opioids, rather than supplant them, because it didn't work better than a widely used opioid drug sold under the brand name Vicodin.

Vertex said it would file for approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by the middle of this year.

""If and when this medicine is approved, it will offer a new option for patients who need pain relief but who do not want to take an opioid,"" Vertex Chief Scientific Officer David Altshuler said in an interview.

Vertex released the results in a press release, not a peer-reviewed medical journal. The company said the researchers who conducted the studies would publish their results in a journal later this year.

About 80 million Americans are prescribed a medicine for moderate-to-severe acute pain each year, according to Vertex. They can choose from a variety of treatments. Many of them take opioids because they work so well.

Yet opioids are highly addictive, and their widespread use has fueled an epidemic of addiction and overdose deaths in the U.S.

To avoid addiction, many doctors, patients and health authorities have sought an alternative that provides as much relief from pain without creating the dependence on use.

Vertex's drug, code-named VX-548, belongs to a new class of medicines that targets molecular mechanisms involved in feeling pain. Researchers have pursued this so-called NaV class for years but experienced repeat setbacks.

NaV refers to the channels through which sodium flows in and out of cells. VX-548 blocks the flow of sodium through a channel called NaV1.8, which plays a role transmitting pain signals to the brain.

The drug, in other words, works by blocking or diminishing pain at the source before it heads to the brain and creates the feeling of pain.

Boston-based Vertex studied VX-548 in three late-stage, or Phase 3, trials that enrolled more than 2,400 subjects with conditions causing moderate-to-severe acute pain.

Two of the trials compared the efficacy of VX-548 against a placebo and Vicodin among subjects who either underwent a ""tummy tuck,"" or abdominoplasty, surgery or a bunion surgery.

The third study measured its efficacy among a range of surgical and nonsurgical acute pain issues .

Study subjects didn't show any serious adverse effects in the three studies, the company said.

Vertex is best known for its blockbuster cystic fibrosis treatments. The company received the first U.S. approval last month for a therapy that uses Crispr gene-editing technology; the drug, called Casgevy, treats people with sickle- cell disease.

VX-548 could open a new, potentially multibillion franchise in pain for the biotech company, Evercore ISI analyst Liisa Bayko said. ""It's a totally new class of drugs that have never made it this far,"" she said in an interview before the company released the trial results.

If approved, however, the drug will face heavy competition, including from low-price generics, according to analysts. To gain traction, Vertex will have to build experience and relationships in the market.

1306,Does this stock research data exist?,2,1aemd09,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1aemd09/does_this_stock_research_data_exist/,11,"I compile some research myself for trading a portfolio of stocks and was wondering if anyone knows of a larger public source of it (covering more stocks than the ones I track)?

What I do is look at the breakdown of how a company (such as BP) makes its money from its last earnings report (BP mostly sells their own gas and fuel to customers in the uk and usa). Then I check to see how the costs and price it‚Äôs sold at changes to work out if the profit has jumped up or down (if fuel prices at the pump have jumped then I can work out roughly how much more profit BP has made). This gives me the edge of knowing if a stock is undersold or overbought and could jump when the new report is released.

I‚Äôm sure big trading firms with offices full of staff work this out for themselves BUT what I want to know is if there is a public source of this info I can use to cut down on the work I have to do. I would pay for a good source too if that was needed.

Thanks in advance for any advice or comments on what I am doing

Update: after speaking to a helpful person on this thread it looks like what I am doing is forming a ‚Äúfair value‚Äù of a company based on changing market conditions. It seems like the solutions out there are formed by analysts who don‚Äôt go into depth why they formed a price target. Maybe people aren‚Äôt interested in that level of data?

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

1315,China Evergrande has been ordered to liquidate. The real estate giant owes over $300 billion,3167,1aduhbq,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1aduhbq/china_evergrande_has_been_ordered_to_liquidate/,320,"HONG KONG (AP) ‚Äî A Hong Kong court ordered China Evergrande, the world‚Äôs most heavily indebted real estate developer, to undergo liquidation following a failed effort to restructure $300 billion owed to banks and bondholders that fueled fears about China‚Äôs rising debt burden.

‚ÄúIt would be a situation where the court says enough is enough,‚Äù Judge Linda Chan said Monday. She said it was appropriate for the court to order Evergrande to wind up its business given a ‚Äúlack of progress on the part of the company putting forward a viable restructuring proposal‚Äù as well as Evergrande‚Äôs insolvency.

China Evergrande Group is among dozens of Chinese developers that have collapsed since 2020 under official pressure to rein in surging debt the ruling Communist Party views as a threat to China‚Äôs slowing economic growth.

But the crackdown on excess borrowing tipped the property industry into crisis, dragging on the economy and rattling financial systems in and outside China.

Chinese regulators have said the risks of global shockwaves from Evergrande‚Äôs failure can be contained. The court documents seen Monday showed Evergrande owes about $25.4 billion to foreign creditors. Its total assets of about $240 billion are dwarfed by its total liabilities.

‚ÄúIt is indisputable that the company is grossly insolvent and is unable to pay its debts,‚Äù the documents say.

About 90% of Evergrande‚Äôs business is in mainland China. Its chairman, Hui Ka Yan, who is also known as Xu Jiayin, was detained by authorities for suspected ‚Äúillegal crimes‚Äù in late September, further complicating the company‚Äôs efforts to recover.

It‚Äôs unclear how the liquidation order will affect China‚Äôs financial system or Evergrande‚Äôs operations as it struggles to deliver housing that has been paid for but not yet handed over to families that put their life savings into such investments.

**2024 Earning guidance of $0.07 to $0.08 (Estimated $0.06)**

***This is going to Catch the Eyes of Institutional Investors!***

* Accelerating Revenue Growth, Expanding Margins and GAAP Profitability
* Fourth Quarter $615 Million GAAP Net Revenue Up 35% Year-over-Year; $594 Million Adjusted Net Revenue Up 34% Year-over-Year
* Record Fourth Quarter Adjusted EBITDA of $181 Million Up 159% Year-over-Year, 30% Target Margin Reached
* Fourth Quarter Positive GAAP Net Income of $48 Million, GAAP EPS of $0.02
* Quarterly New Member Adds of Nearly 585,000; Total Members Up 44% Year-over-Year to Over 7.5 Million
* Quarterly New Product Adds of Nearly 695,000; Total Products Up 41% Year-over-Year to Over 11.1 Million
* Fourth Quarter Total Deposit Growth of $2.9 Billion to $18.6 Billion
* Fourth Quarter Growth in Tangible Book Value of $204 Million, up $334 Million for Full Year 2023
* Diversification Milestone with 40% of Fourth Quarter Adjusted Net Revenue from Tech Platform and Financial Services Segments
* For the full year 2024, management expects Tech Platform and Financial Services segments combined to grow at least 50% and lending revenue to be 92% to 95% of 2023 levels, and expenses under the EBITDA line to be flat when compared to 2023 results, excluding the reported goodwill impairment expense. This guidance anticipates an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 30% by year-end, which equates to a range of $580 to $590 million for the year. We anticipate that revenue from our Tech Platform and Financial Services segments, combined, will be approximately equal to revenue from our Lending segment for the year. That equates to full-year GAAP net income in the range of $95 to $105 million, or GAAP EPS of $0.07 to $0.08. We expect growth in tangible book value of $300 to $500 million for the year. In terms of Member growth, we expect at least 2.3 million new members during the full year 2024, which represents 30% growth.
* Looking beyond 2024 management expects 20% to 25% compound revenue growth for the time periods of 2023 through 2026, assuming no meaningful changes in the macroeconomic environment and no significant new business launches or acquisitions. This implies 50% compound growth for Financial Services revenue, mid-20% compound growth for Technology Platform revenue, and mid teens compound growth for Lending segment revenue. This is **expected to drive between $0.55 and $0.80 in GAAP earnings per share in 2026**. Moreover, we see 20% to 25% EPS growth beyond 2026 reflecting both the continued growth of the core business growth plus the added benefit from new business lines launched in the 2024 to 2026 time period.

1319,Tesla's Bull Case,0,1adgztd,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1adgztd/teslas_bull_case/,149,"I see a lot of negative sentiment around Tesla and a true lack of understanding of what is to come.

I have been in Tesla since 2017 and this company has evolved in ways I never imagined.

I am more bullish today than I have ever been.

This is not investment advice and I honestly don't care whether you buy, sell, short, use options or anything else.

&#x200B;

People see Tesla's market cap of approximately $575 billion and immediately think it's overvalued.  They only make X amount, they only sold X amount, and Elon said/did this today.

&#x200B;

If it were as easy as looking at what a company currently is, or what they have done, everyone would be rich.  That is not how investing works.  There needs to be an understanding of what the future will look like.

&#x200B;

The future I see is one of abundance of labor, energy, time, etc.

&#x200B;

Tesla is set up to capitalize like no other company in history and become larger than anything anyone has ever built before.

&#x200B;

Lets focus on the now for a moment though.

&#x200B;

Things to understand, the company has the #1 selling vehicle in the world.  Not just #1 EV, it's the #1 car.

The TAM for there current lineup of vehicles is approaching it's cap with current interest rates and pricing.  The growth will be moderate compared to what people are use too from Tesla.

The current lineup of vehicles is printing money for them though, which is padding there balance sheet now with $29 billion in cash, about 5% of the market cap and the rest covering all of their current investments in the future and operations.

So for 2024 we can expect moderate volume growth and everyone already knows.

What will margins look like in 2024, nobody really knows, some people think it will continue to trend down, some people think it bottomed in Q3, when it bounced up slightly in Q4. Regardless I know that they will be printing more money and strengthening their balance sheet further while growing current projects.

They will also be ramping the Cybertruck as well this year, new product for which I expect in the 75k-100k range produced/delivered.

So that is vehicle outlook for 2024.

&#x200B;

What about energy which just seems like a completely overlooked aspect of the business.

They delivered over 14 gwh of energy storage in 2023, up from 6 gwh in 2022.

The Lathrop factory is scaling to produce 40 gwh annually and they have a new factory in shanghai on the books to come on later this year for an additional 40 gwh of production.

Tesla did about $3.9 billion in revenue in 2022 from energy,  around $6.4 billion 2023.

They only deployed 14 gwh of what will soon be 80 gwh of capacity and it already is starting to impact their profits positively and becoming a meaningful source of profits and revenue.

So while the vehicle business will have lower growth in 2024, the energy business will have accelerated growth.

What about batteries? Tesla is ramping their own 4680's and expects to install additional lines later this year and produce all they need for the Cybertruck ramp as well as Semi and future projects that require it.

The IRA bill that passed is going to pay Tesla for the production of these batteries.  They literally are looking to be at a production rate of 100 gwhr of 4680's annually later this year and will get paid per kwhr produced.  This amount of money that will come in is not understood yet.

So for 2024, energy is entering into a very interesting and lucrative phase.

&#x200B;

I am not really going to touch on charging much but their network of chargers continues to grow, other vehicle manufactures will gain access this year as well as all the new Tesla's produced, this is something to consider.

&#x200B;

Okay so that covers 2024, I expect earnings to be far better than people expect, especially in the latter half of the year.

&#x200B;

What about the future?

The TAM for vehicles will be expanding massively.  They already said they plan to produce their next generation vehicle in 2025 in Austin and then expand to their new factory in Mexico, and another undecided location for a factory overseas.  The #1 selling car is the Model Y at over 1.2 million sold annually.  What happens when there is a new vehicle for a fraction of the cost made by Tesla.  I don't even know if it will qualify for the POS tax credit from the IRA but if it does, the price for this car could be insane. It's already expected to be sub 25k. This thing will sell many millions and usher in that next wave of vehicle growth. The car goes into production next year, did I say that already, NEXT YEAR.

&#x200B;

Lets talk about what is probably the greatest opportunity of our lifetime, I am not even talking about FSD for autonomous vehicles which would revolutionize travel and the economics of it for people and the company, I am talking about Humanoid Bots.  I don't think people understand that they are coming, not just from Tesla but multiple companies and they are around the corner.  This is real, everyone is asleep right now and don't realize but this is happening.  They are going to be filling labor gaps initially, and eventually will be everywhere will Millions shipping.

&#x200B;

The economics for this type of product is hard to fathom, people do not understand and Tesla is the best positioned out of any company with their manufacturing capabilities, engineering, ai background and access to capital.

&#x200B;

So while I believe 2024 will be better than people realize thanks to stable margins from vehicles, acceleration of growth in energy, and a tam expansion coming in 2025 to lead the next wave of volume and eps growth, these things will pale in comparison to what this Bot represents and it is not priced in, nor is the next gen vehicle.

&#x200B;

Do your own DD, make your own decision, but I am ready for what is to come and will capitalize on it.

1322,Nick Timiraos - Plummeting Inflation Raises New Risk for Fed: Rising Real Interest Rates,32,1adc5g0,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1adc5g0/nick_timiraos_plummeting_inflation_raises_new/,13,">*Central bank feels pressure to cut interest rates as falling inflation raises real cost of borrowing*

https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/plummeting-inflation-raises-new-risk-for-fed-rising-real-interest-rates-fd2a4f37

Federal Reserve officials start the year with a problem they would ordinarily love to have: Inflation has fallen much faster than expected.

It does, nonetheless, pose a conundrum. The reason: If inflation has sustainably returned to the Fed‚Äôs 2% target, then real rates‚Äînominal rates adjusted for inflation‚Äîhave risen and might be restricting economic activity too much. This means the Fed needs to cut interest rates. The question is, when and by how much?  

The Fed won‚Äôt cut at its two-day meeting ending this Wednesday because the economy has been growing solidly. While inflation excluding food and energy on a monthly basis has been at or below 2% in six of the last seven months, the Fed wants to be sure that can be sustained before cutting rates.

Instead, Fed officials are likely to take a symbolically important step this week by no longer signaling in their policy statement that rates are more likely to rise than fall. Ditching this so-called tightening bias would affirm that officials are entertaining lower rates in the coming months.

Normally, the Fed cuts interest rates because economic activity is slowing sharply. Not this time: Growth remained surprisingly robust through the end of last year. Rather, they are mulling whether softening inflation means real interest rates will be unnecessarily restrictive if they don‚Äôt act.

Militating against a rate cut soon: Bond yields have fallen and stocks have risen, which could bolster economic activity and consumer spending. For that reason, officials could wait until May or even later to cut, said William English, a former senior Fed economist who is a professor at Yale School of Management.

On the other hand, ‚Äúif they get genuinely reassuring inflation numbers and the real economy seems to be slowing a bit, I could see them getting comfortable with a cut in March,‚Äù he said.

**The case for cutting later**

Policymakers might want to move carefully to lower rates because they are not sure if the recent inflation cooling will last or if the economy will rev up in a way that sustains somewhat higher inflation. Several officials have said they want to avoid at all costs cutting rates only to have to raise them again.

Dean Maki, chief economist at hedge fund Point72 Asset Management, thinks the Fed will wait until June to cut interest rates because growth and hiring will exceed its expectations this year.

Concerns that lower inflation will raise real rates are misplaced because it will also boost purchasing power, consumer confidence and spending, said Maki. ‚ÄúGrowth strengthens when inflation falls. I can‚Äôt think of examples in the last several decades where growth weakens after inflation falls,‚Äù he said.

It is also possible the economy can tolerate higher rates than before. In December, most officials thought the neutral rate, which balances supply and demand when the economy is operating at full strength, was 2.5%, well below the actual rate, which has been between 5.25% and 5.5% since July. That implies rates are highly restrictive, yet the economy hasn‚Äôt behaved that way.  

Officials ‚Äúhave tended to let the data tell them they‚Äôre overly restrictive rather than rely‚Äù on estimates of neutral, said Maki.

**The case for cutting sooner**

Others warn that waiting for the data to signal the Fed is too restrictive will require the type of aggressive cuts reserved for an economy falling into recession, as occurred in 2001 and 2007. They point to latent risks from heavily indebted companies, especially in real estate, which locked in lower interest rates earlier in the pandemic. Those borrowers might struggle as that debt is refinanced at higher rates.

The argument for lowering rates sooner goes like this: Fed officials raised rates rapidly to a 22-year high and telegraphed plans to keep them there for a while because they worried it would take years for inflation to fall back to their target. But inflation has fallen much faster than they expected. Prices excluding food and energy rose at a 1.9% annualized rate between July and December, down from 4% in the previous six-month period.

‚ÄúWe made a very aggressive tightening. Look not only at the supply that came back but also the demand that came down last year,‚Äù said Esther George, who served as president of the Kansas City Fed from 2011 until last year. There is potentially ‚Äúa lot of room‚Äù to cut rates before they are in neutral territory again.  

Officials are also shrinking their $7.7 trillion asset portfolio‚Äîsometimes called ‚Äúquantitative tightening‚Äù or QT‚Äîfaster than they did five years ago. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve got QT going on steroids, still,‚Äù said George.

Policymakers are right to worry that cutting rates then raising them again would blemish their credibility, said George. But she said the greater risk now is that taking too long to cut rates causes damage to the labor market that is hard to repair.

In November, for example, the hiring rate in the U.S. dropped to its lowest level in 10 years, a sign more companies might feel they are overstaffed. ‚ÄúThe labor market is such a tricky one,‚Äù said George. Before a downturn, ‚Äúit always looks like it‚Äôs not too bad, and then it goes south quickly.‚Äù

Officials raised rates because they worried high inflation would lead businesses and consumers to expect high prices to persist, creating a self-fulfilling cycle and a rerun of the 1970s. But it increasingly looks as if a series of shocks generated a one-off surge in prices across successive sectors‚Äîgoods, housing, services and labor, said Dario Perkins, an economist at GlobalData TS Lombard in London. That gave the impression inflation‚Äôs increase was persistent when in fact it wasn‚Äôt. 

‚ÄúYou should be able to cut interest rates quite rapidly if that scary 1970s dynamic isn‚Äôt happening, and it isn‚Äôt happening,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe lesson of the last 12 months is that we don‚Äôt really need pain to get inflation down to tolerable levels.‚Äù",2024-01-28,0
1323,Billionaire bond fund manager questions unemployment data: ‚ÄòHard to believe‚Äô,357,1ad8dys,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ad8dys/billionaire_bond_fund_manager_questions/,148,"This is the NY Post so take with a grain of salt.

https://nypost.com/2024/01/27/lifestyle/billionaire-bond-fund-manager-jeffrey-gundlach-questions-unemployment-data-hard-to-believe/

I do NOT believe in conspiracy theories, but sometimes I think we assume one data source is magical and the final word.  Good science is testing, auditing, verifying from many different sources.  

Example, I've seen great debates of reasonable people debating whether CPI is good or should be improved, particularly how it measures shelter and comparing it to history.

https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w30116/w30116.pdf

In this post though I am particularly interested in this claim of unemployment.  

Maybe those with a background in econometrics can chime in with whether there are any potential distortions in unemployment or if there are reasons to believe perhaps it is lagging?  Anything backed with data or links to articles by economists would be great, refutation or support both appreciated.

If so obviously this could have large implications on consumer spending and market valuations going forward.",2024-01-28,0

 and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co
. (TSMC), in the coming weeks to help build new factories in the United States, The Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday.


The forthcoming announcements are aimed at kick-starting manufacturing of advanced semiconductors that power smartphones, artificial intelligence and weapons systems, the WSJ reported, citing industry executives familiar with the negotiations.


The executives expect some announcements to come before U.S. President Joe Biden‚Äôs State of the Union address on March 7, the WSJ report added.


Among the likely recipients of the subsidies, Intel has projects underway in Arizona, Ohio, New Mexico and Oregon that will cost more than $43.5 billion, the Journal said.


TSMC has two plants under construction near Phoenix for a total investment of $40 billion. South Korea‚Äôs Samsung Electronics, also a contender, has a $17.3 billion project in Texas.


Micron Technology
, Texas Instruments
 and GlobalFoundries
 count among other top contenders, WSJ said, citing industry executives.


The U.S. Department of Commerce, Intel, and TSMC did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.


In December 2023, U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said she would make around a dozen funding awards for semiconductor chips within the next year, including multibillion-dollar announcements that could drastically reshape U.S. chip production.


The first award was announced in December, of over $35 million to a BAE Systems facility in Hampshire to produce chips for fighter planes, part of a $39 billion ‚ÄúChips for America‚Äù subsidy program approved by the U.S. Congress in 2022.",2024-01-28,0

I thought it was around 175, but the bears have gotten more bearish and with hopes for rate cuts abating as GDP grew 3.3 and disinflation chugging on, I'm not sure anymore. Where do you see Tesla's stock landing?*

***This is from*** ***CNBC Pro.....***

***Key Takeaway:***

*\*JPMorgan cuts Tesla's price target to $130, predicting a 30% drop due to profit concerns and high valuation at 56 times 2024 consensus earnings.*

*\*Despite a 20% increase in vehicle volume, Tesla's Q4 automotive revenue grew only by 1%, indicating price cuts aren't boosting revenue significantly.*

*\*Tesla's operating profit forecast for this year is now $11.4 billion, down from an October estimate of $28.5 billion, yet share prices remain similar.*

***JPMorgan Lowers Price Target for Tesla:***

*JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman cuts the stock price target for Tesla by about 4% to $130, implying a 30% downside from Thursday‚Äôs close of $182.63. The reduction follows softer than expected earnings and a warning from Tesla that vehicle volume growth ""may be notably lower"" this year. Despite these warnings, Tesla's stock closed down only 12%, suggesting further downside potential according to Brinkman.*

***Falling Profits and Valuation Concerns:***

*Tesla's strategy of slashing vehicle prices has not translated into higher revenue, with actual automotive revenue growing by only 1% despite a 20% increase in vehicle volume in the fourth quarter. Analysts have substantially lowered profit expectations for Tesla since October 2022, with operating profit forecasted at $11.4 billion compared to the previous estimate of $28.5 billion for 2024.*

*Brinkman rates Tesla as underweight due to above-average execution risk and valuation concerns that seem to be pricing in significant upside related to expansion into mass-market segments beyond their volume forecasts for the Model 3.*

***STREET VIEWS***

*Ryan Brinkman, JPMorgan Analyst (Bearish on Tesla):*

*""Tesla profit expectations have fallen, but even after Thursday's sell-off, the stock to us seems in comparison to have hardly noticed, suggesting plenty of further downside potential."" ""Tesla did not trade profits for sales as measured in revenue ‚Äî it has traded profits for sales as measured in unit volume."" ""Although both technology and execution risk seem substantially less than was once feared, expansion into higher volume segments with lower price points seems fraught with greater risk relative to demand, execution, and competition.""*

LVMH shares jumped more than 12% on Friday morning, after the world‚Äôs largest luxury group posted higher-than-expected sales for 2023 and raised its annual dividend. The owner of Louis Vuitton, Mo√´t & Chandon and Hennessy, as well as brands including Givenchy, Bulgari and Sephora, on Thursday night reported sales amounting to 86.15 billion euros ($93.34 billion) for 2023, exceeding consensus forecasts and equating to 13% organic growth from the previous year. Organic revenue was up 10% in the fourth quarter. The result was boosted in particular by 14% annual growth in the critical fashion and leather goods sector, along with 11% growth in perfumes and cosmetics. Wines and spirits meanwhile posted a 4% decline.

‚ÄúOur performance in 2023 illustrates the exceptional appeal of our Maisons and their ability to spark desire, despite a year affected by economic and geopolitical challenges,‚Äù Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of LVMH, said in a statement. ‚ÄúWhile remaining vigilant in the current context, we enter 2024 with confidence, backed by our highly desirable brands and our agile teams.‚Äù After a boom during the pandemic, the luxury sector endured a rough end to 2023 as challenging geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions weighed on consumer spending, particularly in the U.S. and China. LVMH in April 2023 became the first European company to surpass $500 billion in market value, but a share price decline over the last six months allowed it to be eclipsed as Europe‚Äôs largest company by Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk.

Javier Gonzalez Lastra, portfolio manager of the Tema Luxury ETF, told CNBC on Thursday that investors are trying to gauge where the bottom of the earnings cycle revision is for the luxury sector. He predicted that earnings are ‚Äúlikely to get tougher‚Äù through the first half of 2024 because of last year‚Äôs unusually high annual comparisons. Arnault, however, is pinning some hope on LVMH‚Äôs partnership with the Paris 2024 Olympics, which he said ‚Äúprovides a new opportunity to reinforce our global leadership position in luxury goods and promote France‚Äôs reputation for excellence around the world.",2024-01-26,0
1344,Fed‚Äôs favorite inflation gauge rose 0.2% in December and was up 2.9% from a year ago,239,1abjaix,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1abjaix/feds_favorite_inflation_gauge_rose_02_in_december/,113,"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/26/pce-inflation-december-2023-.html

An important inflation gauge released Friday showed that the rate of price increases cooled as 2023 came to a close.

The Commerce Department‚Äôs personal consumption expenditures price index for December, an important gauge for the Federal Reserve, increased 0.2% on the month and was up 2.9% on a yearly basis, excluding food and energy. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for respective increases of 0.2% and 3%.

On a monthly basis, core inflation increased from 0.1% in November. However, the annual rate declined from 3.2%. The 12-month rate is the lowest since March 2021.

Including volatile food and energy costs, headline inflation also rose 0.2% for the month and held steady at 2.6% annually.

The release adds to evidence that inflation, while still elevated, is continuing to make progress lower, possibly giving the Fed a green light to start cutting interest rates later this year. The central bank targets 2% as a healthy annual inflation rate.

Markets took little notice of the data, with stock futures indicating little change at the open and Treasury yields mostly lower.

As inflation drifted closer to the Fed‚Äôs target, consumer spending increased 0.7%, stronger than the 0.5% estimate. Personal income growth edged lower to 0.3%, in line with the forecast.

The data indicated that consumers are dipping into savings to pay for their expenditures. The personal savings rate fell to 3.7% for the month, down from 4.1% in November.

Within the inflation numbers, prices for goods declined by 0.2% while services prices rose by 0.3%, reversing a trend when inflation began to spike. As the pandemic forced people to stay home more, demand for goods spiked, adding to supply chain problems and exacerbating price increases.

Food prices increased 0.1% on the month while energy goods and services rose 0.3%. Prices for longer-lasting durable goods such as appliances, computers and vehicles decreased 0.4%.",2024-01-26,0

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

* **Hold as cash or bonds** - This seems the safest options, but has no real upsides in the event of an actual market crash, only the prevention of downside losses.

* **Short selling** - I don't want to take on margin interest for that long for a limited upside, plus there's always the saying ""the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent""

* **buy put options** - Will these suffer from terrible theta decay over 1 year period?

Intel shares dropped in extended trading on Thursday after the chipmaker issued an outlook for the first quarter of 2024 that lagged analyst forecasts even as results for the latest quarter beat Wall Street estimates.  
  
Here‚Äôs how Intel did versus LSEG (formerly Refinitiv) consensus expectations for the quarter ended in December:  
  
Earnings per share: 54 cents adjusted, vs. 45 cents expected  
Revenue: $15.4 billion vs. $15.15 billion expected

  
For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, Intel expects earnings per share of 13 cents on between $12.2 billion and $13.2 billion in sales, versus LSEG expectations of 33 cents per share on $14.15 billion of revenue.  
  
Intel posted net income of $2.7 billion, or 63 cents per share, compared to a net loss of $0.7 billion, or 16 cents per share, last year.  
  
With Intel reporting sales growth in the fourth quarter of 10% from $14.04 billion a year earlier, the company breaks a streak of seven quarters with declining revenue.  
  
Intel shares are up over 74% over the past year. The company is the largest semiconductor maker by revenue, according to Gartner, a market research firm, even though its market cap puts it below Nvidia and AMD on Wall Street.  
  
Cloud providers and large tech companies, the big spenders, have been focused on the AI boom, which explains Nvidia‚Äôs recent outperformance. In the past, the most important part in a server was the central processor made by Intel. Now, AI servers can have as many as eight Nvidia or AMD graphics processing units (GPUs) attached to one or two Intel CPUs.  
  
Intel also continues to focus on a five-year plan implemented by CEO Pat Gelsinger, who took over the chipmaker in 2021. Intel wants to catch up to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company in its ability to offer manufacturing services to other companies, while also improving its own branded chips.  
  
Intel has been cutting costs through workforce reductions and offloading small parts of its business. In the past year, the company said it would spin off its programmable chip unit, after turning self-driving car subsidiary Mobileye into an independent company in 2022.  
  
Intel‚Äôs largest division is its Client Computing group, which includes laptop and PC processor chips. The overall PC industry has been in a slump for two years, but recently started showing signs of growth again. Intel reported $8.8 billion in fourth-quarter sales, up 33%.  
  
Intel‚Äôs second largest division, Data Center and AI, saw sales decline 10% to $4 billion. That unit includes server CPUs and GPUs.

>New residential sales rose, led by a boost in the Northeast

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/new-homes-sales-surge-8-in-december-6ad57a5a

U.S. new-home sales rose 8% to an annual rate of 664,000 in December from a revised 615,000 in the prior month, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. 

The number is seasonally adjusted and refers to how many homes would be built over an entire year if builders continued at the same pace every month.

The pace exceeded expectations on Wall Street. Economists had forecast new-home sales to total 649,000 in December.

Mortgage rates dipped below 7% in early December 2023, according to data from Freddie Mac, which could be one reason for increased demand for homes.

New-home sales are still far below a recent peak of over 1 million in August 2020. 

The increase in new-home sales in December was the largest in a year. New-home sales are still far below a recent peak of over 1 million in August 2020. 

The rate of new-home sales was boosted by a sharp increase in the Northeast.

Key details: The median sales price of a new home sold in December fell to $413,200 from $426,000 in the prior month.

The supply of new homes for sale fell 6.8% between November and December.

Most of the U.S. reported an increase in sales of newly built homes, with the Northeast notching a 32% increase in December, followed by more modest increases of around 10% in the Midwest and the South. Only the West saw a drop in new-home sales.

Overall, sales of new homes are up 4.4% compared with last year.

Big picture: New-home sales continue to be a bright spot in the housing sector, and as mortgage rates fall, demand could be further boosted. The housing market continues to rely on newly built homes amid a persistent lack of resale home listings.

What are they saying? New-home sales will continue to rise in 2024, Thomas Ryan, property economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note, as the lock-in effect of current homeowners‚Äô low mortgage rates won‚Äôt fade fast enough, ‚Äúkeeping the supply of secondhand homes on the market historically low.‚Äù

He added: ‚ÄúTherefore, we‚Äôre forecasting new-home sales to reach 781,000 annualized by end-2024, their highest level since the second spike in the demand for new homes at the beginning of 2022.‚Äù

It is the first major announcement under Alex Chriss, who joined PayPal in September, and the new products are another example of how companies are trying to tap investor enthusiasm for AI, which helped drive U.S. stock markets to record highs this month.  
Investors hope Chriss, who was previously a senior executive at software company Intuit, will revive PayPal's stock which is down more than 22% from January last year due to margins which have underwhelmed investors. Chriss has called 2024 a ""transition year"" for PayPal, and has promised to grow revenues beyond transaction-related volume.  
""The data that we have and our ability to actually see what people have bought and know what merchants are trying to target, that's where I think AI is the huge opportunity for us,"" Chriss told Reuters in an interview.  
PayPal will this year roll out a platform that uses AI to enable merchants to reach new customers based on their prior shopping history, using data from the roughly half a trillion dollars' worth of merchant transactions it has processed globally.  
Merchants will also be able to use a separate AI-based tool called ""smart receipts"" to recommend personalized items to shoppers in their email receipts, along with a cashback reward.  
PayPal is introducing a ""one-click"" checkout feature called Fastlane, which in early testing has accelerated checkout speeds nearly 40%, along with new features for Venmo business profiles, the company said.

Now that he has seen the acquisition through as Blizzard‚Äôs president, he has decided to leave the company,‚Äù says Microsoft‚Äôs game content and studios president, Matt Booty, in an internal memo.

1358,Comcast stock jumps 5%; +7% up in dividend; 15bil buybacks; double beat but lost x2 broadband (34k); Cable (389k) & Peacock lost ($825mil).,101,19fcdy7,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/19fcdy7/comcast_stock_jumps_5_7_up_in_dividend_15bil/,22,"*(Question) Realistically, what are the prospects for Peacock on its own? how do we justify these losses? it's consistently the worst-rated streamer, clocking the highest churn, and all its gains come from temporary spikes due to sport events! Netflix has scale, Disney has scale & a diverse hand (Hulu, D+, ESPN+), Max leads market in quality. As for Paramount+ & Peacock! they seem like money pits to me.* 

***This comes from the*** [***Hollywood Reporter***](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/comcast-earnings-peacock-loss-2023-nbcuniversal-1235805822/)***: CFO Jason Armstrong on Peacock:*** 

*Comcast CFO Jason Armstrong told analysts during a morning call that the 3 million new Peacock subscribers during the latest financial quarter came in part from viewers drawn to NFL and Big Ten football games, without specifying actual numbers. NBCU‚Äôs loss related to Peacock amounted to $825 million in the fourth quarter, compared with a year-ago loss of $978 million on revenue of $660 million.*  
*Cavanagh during the conference call talked up Peacock streaming a Saturday night wildcard NFL playoff game, which averaged 23 million viewers on the flagship online platform, local NBC affiliates in the teams‚Äô home markets and on the NFL+ mobile app.*  
*‚ÄúOur investment in the network and our technology platforms built over decades enabled us to shine, delivering a seamless experience on the Internet and Peacock, demonstrating that our company is in an excellent position to win in this era of high bandwidth,‚Äù he told analysts.* 

*To additionally bolster Peacock, Cavanagh reiterated that Christopher Nolan‚Äôs Oscar-nominated Oppenheimer biopic will exclusively stream on Peacock from Feb. 16, well after its theatrical release from July 2023. And he touted the 2024 Olympics set to stream on Peacock live, with many of the events also airing live on NBC and other NBCUniversal TV platforms.*  
*Cavanagh called Peacock ‚Äúthe fastest growing streamer in the U.S.,‚Äù as he looked beyond continuing operating losses to leveraging the streamer as part an overall and expanding TV offering for consumers across a range of NBCUniversal platforms treated as one holistic ecosystem. CFO Armstrong told analysts: ‚Äú2023 marked the peak in annual losses at Peacock and for 2024 we expect to show meaningful improvements in losses, versus 2023.‚Äù The entertainment conglomerate previously had vowed to reach ‚Äúpeak losses‚Äù at around $2.8 billion for Peacock in 2023, down from $3 billion previously. On Thursday, it disclosed that the 2023 loss had amounted to $2.75 billion. Peacock‚Äôs revenue continued to grow in the latest period and for all of 2023.*  
*Cavanagh told analysts he was more focused on how Peacock was faring amidst NBCUniversal TV‚Äôs overall strategy, than on its own. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm less focused on what standalone Peacock losses are doing than I am on doing what‚Äôs right fro the long term and the totality of the media business, which is linear and streaming. I think we‚Äôve navigated a very good path for us,‚Äù he said.*  
*As legacy media cedes streaming subscriber scale to Netflix, streaming profits have been in focus for Wall Street. For comparison, in its most recent quarter Warner Bros. Discovery posted a $111 million profit for its direct-to-consumer division that includes Max/Discovery+, while Paramount Global disclosed a $424 million streaming loss and Disney lost $387 million on its Disney+/ESPN+/Hulu combined business.*  
*The latest Peacock updates were part of Comcast‚Äôs fourth-quarter and full-year earnings report.*

1364,Why I‚Äôm Buying Rivian Stock,369,19f3fgb,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/19f3fgb/why_im_buying_rivian_stock/,544,"Individual stock picking is for smart people who wear expensive suits. I‚Äôm not very smart and I hate wearing suits. I‚Äôm a boring index-fund guy. After all, history and math show us that the safe path to retirement is to simply plop money into a Vanguard fund every month. And that‚Äôs what I do with most of my money.  
  
But sometimes I see a juicy opportunity that fires me up. Occasionally, the timing of that opportunity is juuuuusst right and I put real money on the line. This is one of those situations and I'd love to hear what you think about it.  
  
I recently bought 4000 shares of Rivian stock (RIVN). My average cost is just over $16/share. That amounts to about $65,000. At the time of this writing, Rivian floats around $15.00/share and has a $14.5b market cap. I might buy another 1000 shares depending on the feedback that I get to this post.  
  
Anyway, here is why I believe Rivian will 3-4x in the next few years. 

# Point #1 ‚Äì Big Picture - EV‚Äôs Will Win‚Ä¶ Guaranteed.

Over the next 25 years, the auto industry is going to transition to electric vehicles because they will be cheaper to buy and operate. Hear me out:

1. Right now, batteries are the most expensive part of an EV. But EV battery tech is in its infancy. Incremental advances in batteries will increase the energy density and versatility of batteries year by year. More importantly, the industry will scale battery production by a few orders of magnitude. This will make EV batteries significantly cheaper to purchase on a per unit basis.
2. Government‚Äôs will continue to incentivize EV purchases with tax credits and other incentives for decades to come. In the long run, governments are definitely going to incentivize large scale energy creation by renewable means (which is getting cheaper and cheaper). On the other hand, western Governments are not going to subsidize or incentivize more coal power plants. That is just a fact.
3. Moreover, gas cars are only going to get more expensive operate because gas is a finite resource. The world is literally running out of oil. We‚Äôve only got like 100-200 years left. So, gas prices are going to go up guaranteed. On the other hand, we ain‚Äôt gonna run out of electricity. Humans will continue to innovate and drive down the relative cost of electricity. This is inevitable.

I know I‚Äôm painting with broad strokes here, but I think any rational mind will agree with most of these assertions. Stay with me. This post gets better as I go‚Ä¶  
  
Now, just because EV‚Äôs will be less expensive than ICE vehicles in the long run doesn‚Äôt mean Rivian is going to win the game. OEM‚Äôs like Ford, GM & Stellantis are starting to produce and sell EV‚Äôs‚Ä¶ right??? Won‚Äôt Ford and Toyota and others crush Rivian at the EV game? Nope‚Ä¶ not a chance. Keep reading and I‚Äôll show you why.

# Point #2 ‚Äì Pure EV Makers like Rivian & Telsa Will Crush Traditional Auto Manufacturers

Ford, GM, and Stellantis don‚Äôt stand a chance against Tesla & Rivian. Even if they start making compelling EV‚Äôs for customers, OEM‚Äôs will be at a long-term structural disadvantage to Rivian & Tesla. Here is why:

1. Rivian does not have a dealership sales model. Dealerships are a useless 3rd party which customers hate. Removing the dealership permits Rivian to sell its vehicles for cheaper than it otherwise could, but also make more profit than it otherwise could. This will be a long-term structural competitive advantage over OEMs.
2. Rivian does not have unions. Unions uniquely harm the automobile industry because the cost of strikes and the cost of artificial wage increases after the strike ends increase the cost of vehicles. The 2023 UAW strike is a good example. If Rivian treats its employees with dignity and respect, they should avoid unionization. This will be a long-term competitive advantage over OEMs.
3. Rivian will make money from servicing and repairing vehicles. In the current OEM-dealership model, the dealership makes more money from the service department than it does selling vehicles. While it generally costs less to service and maintain an EV, collisions & accidents can be more expensive to repair than ICE vehicles. There is a lot of money to be made by repairing & servicing EVs and Rivian has it‚Äôs own service department. As such, it will capture that revenue as opposed to giving it to the dealership. This will be another long-term competitive advantage over OEMs.
4. Rivian is vertically integrated (especially when it comes to software). Traditional auto companies are not. These companies suck at software. Meanwhile, customers want high quality software in their vehicles that works seamlessly with their phones, homes, and other devices. Rivian, at its core, is a software driven company. This allows them to update their vehicles over-the-air. This will give them an enormous advantage in the long run at improving, iterating, fixing and keeping their customers happy.

Okay, okay, okay‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve convinced you that pure EV companies are going to have inherent advantages over traditional auto. That still doesn‚Äôt mean that Rivian is going to be a winner. After all‚Ä¶ Tesla is crushing them right now. Rivian isn‚Äôt even profitable yet. If you‚Äôre going to bet on a pure EV, why not pick Tesla???  
  
Tesla is great. I‚Äôve got nothing bad to say about it. They make amazing cars, they have a genius founder, and it has amazing long-term potential. But this write-up isn‚Äôt about Tesla. I don‚Äôt think Rivian is better than Tesla. It‚Äôs not.   
  
This write-up is more about the timing of things for Rivian. I think Rivian‚Äôs stock is uniquely undervalued right now relative to where it should be. I personally feel like this value disparity is easier for me to see for Rivian than it is for Tesla.   
  
Anyway, lets continue‚Ä¶.

# Point #3 ‚Äì Rivian Makes Wonderful Vehicles that Customers Love

Rivian makes beautiful vehicles and customers love them. The outdoor-adventure brand is on point. Aesthetics and brand really matter to buyers, and Rivian vehicles rock.   
  
While most people hear the name ‚ÄúRivian‚Äù they think of Rivian‚Äôs truck (R1T). But in reality their higher-priced SUV, (R1S) is far more popular. The CEO said on an earnings call that the demand is for 2 R1S‚Äôs for every 1 R1T.   
  
Now, I see a lot of R1T‚Äôs and R1S on the road here in CA. And I see more and more of them each week. Just about every single R1S driver I see here in California is good-looking mom driving her kids to soccer. That‚Äôs a good sign. I‚Äôm convinced that middle & upper-class women absolutely love the R1S. I think the R1S is going to be enormously popular. Remember how popular Range Rovers were about ten years ago? I think the R1S is going to be that kind of popular‚Ä¶.  
  
But the R1S doesn‚Äôt just appeal to soccer moms. I want one. And I‚Äôm a guy who likes to go off-roading, camping, and hiking. I‚Äôm a dude, and I love Rivian vehicles. I think the R1S is going to be a massive hit.   
  
Whether you believe me or not, no one can dispute that outdoor adventure brands really resonate with humans. Maybe that is why Rivian was ranked highest in customer satisfaction by JD Power in 2023. There is a lasting durability to selling adventure. I think Rivian‚Äôs brand is built to last.  
  
Moreover, I really like Rivian‚Äôs management team. The CEO, RJ Scaringe, and CFO, Claire McDonough, just seem to work hard with their heads down. I personally like that RJ is an engineer who went to MIT. While they have clearly made a few mistakes, I don‚Äôt think they have made any big ones. They are not flashy or full of crap (think Nikola‚Ä¶).  
  
But EVEN if I‚Äôm right about everything so far, that still doesn‚Äôt mean Rivian is a good stock to buy. Keep reading to hear the good stuff‚Ä¶.

# Point #4 ‚Äì Rivian Has Enormous Upside Right Now

Why would anyone want to invest in Rivian right now? At a surface level, Rivian looks like they have big problems:

* Currently, Rivian is losing money on every R1 vehicle it sells. It allegedly makes money on its electric delivery vans but does not disclose how much.
* Moreover, Rivian got crushed in 2022 in the supply chain shortage that delayed vehicle production. Theoretically, that could happen again.
* Then interest rates started rising in 2023 making it more expensive for normal people to get a loan to buy these pricey vehicles. Most people who buy vehicles finance or lease them. Very few people buy them with cash.
* Rivian has had growing-pains with their vehicles. They‚Äôve had recalls (steering issue), mechanical issues (tonneau cover defect), accessory issues (wireless phone charger defect), and a bunch of other minor problems. These growing pains would really frustrate me if I spent $95k on a vehicle.
* Rivian will be shutting down its production line for a few weeks in Q2 of 2024 to make improvements to the manufacturing line. This is definitely going to slow their numbers for that quarter.
* Beyond that, even if Rivian miraculously scaled production to max capacity tomorrow at their Normal, Illinois, manufacturing plant, (150,000 vehicles) and sold every vehicle at their current prices, I don‚Äôt think the company would be profitable to a level that would excite me. 

Well all this sounds terrible! Why on earth would anyone buy their stock now??? Oh boy‚Ä¶ let me tell you why‚Ä¶.

&#x200B;

* **Mass-Market Vehicle Announcement** \- If you‚Äôve been following Rivian, you know that it does not have a chance of long-term success unless it introduces and starts selling a mass market vehicle much like Tesla did with the Model 3 in 2017. 
   * The Model S really launched Tesla into the public eye in 2014/15. But it didn‚Äôt start making real money until the Model 3. The R1 line at Rivian is meant to be Rivian‚Äôs ‚ÄúModel S.‚Äù It has successfully done that. People love the product. Now, the only way Rivian will become profitable is if it starts building it‚Äôs own Model 3. And that is about to happen.
   * Rivian plans to introduce the R2 on March 7, 2024, in Laguna Beach, CA. This is supposed to be an affordable midsize SUV costing anywhere between $40,000 and $50,000 per vehicle. If it is anything like the R1S, I suspect it will be beautiful and a high-quality competitor to the Model Y ‚Äì the most popular selling EV in the world. 
   * Rivian is currently building a manufacturing plant in Georgia to produce the R2. It has broken ground and should be finished in early 2026. Once up and fully scaled, it should be able to make 400,000 vehicles per year.

&#x200B;

* **Steadily Marching to Profitability** \- As it continues to scale up production, Rivian‚Äôs loss per vehicle is shrinking dramatically quarter after quarter. In Q3 2022, it lost $139,277 per vehicle. That egregious. But that number was expected at the time and now it is shrinking dramatically. In Q3 of 2023, it lost $30,600 per vehicle. That is still a lot, but the change from one year earlier is monumental. 
   * Management claims they will be gross margin profitable per vehicle at the end of Q4 2024. Management says the delta they are chasing is literally baked into contracts it has with its suppliers. As they increase and improve production throughout 2024, the margin on labor per vehicle and parts from suppliers gets better and better.
   * On the 2023 Q3 earnings call, the CFO said, ‚ÄúOverall, we continue to see a clear path to our approximately 25% gross margin target, high-teens adjusted EBITDA margin target, and approximately 10% free cash flow margin target.‚Äù

&#x200B;

* **Interest Rates Will Go Down** \- Despite a full year of rising interest rates, Rivian‚Äôs demand has been so high it has not needed to reduce prices in order to sell its very expensive vehicles. In fact, it raised prices in March 2023. Meanwhile, other EV manufacturers like Tesla have slashed prices. 
   * In December 2024, the federal reserve signaled it will no longer raise interest rates, and will probably start cutting them slowly over the next few years. This means demand for Rivian vehicles will only go up as their production scales up. That sounds like perfect timing. 
   * Moreover, when the fed starts cutting rates, trillions of dollars will start flowing back into the market, increasing valuations. Read Warren Buffet‚Äôs 1999 Fortune article called Mr. Buffett on the Stock Market. IMO, it is highly likely that ‚Äúspeculative‚Äù stocks like Rivian and Tesla will be enormous beneficiaries of all this buying. The fed may start cutting rates as early as the end of Q1 2024 (but more likely Q2 or Q3 2024).

&#x200B;

* **EV‚Äôs Have Been Unfairly Beaten Up in the News Lately** ‚Äì Starting in mid/late 2023, there has been a lot of speculation in the financial news that EV‚Äôs are overhyped and will not take over the market as previously thought. This fear, uncertainty, and doubt has suppressed the share prices of all the pure EV players. If this FUD has any validity at all, it is only a short-term speed bump.
   * Remember, the inherent and structural advantages of pure EV manufacturers will win out in the long run because the costs to buy EV‚Äôs will be lower than ICE vehicles (See Point #1 & 2 above). Over time, this will prove decisive. Moreover, for some reason, the conservative side of the news media loves to bash EVs. This is just silly politics and will end with time. I mean, why on earth would conservatives honestly dislike American made vehicles with ridiculous amounts of horsepower! The bashing will end with time. I‚Äôm confident of that.

&#x200B;

* **Rivian could announce new EDV deal at any time‚Ä¶** Right now, Rivian has orders to sell about 85,000 more EDV‚Äôs to Amazon by 2030 under their 100,000 vehicle contract. This deal used to be ‚Äúexclusive‚Äù with Amazon, but this contract was recently changed and now Rivian can sell EDV‚Äôs to other delivery companies. That is fantastic.
   * What is even better is that on November 7, 2023, RJ Scaringe said in Q3 earnings call that ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be announcing soon a range of different pilot programs that will perceive much larger orders, as these large fleets start to plan the electrification of their infrastructure.‚Äù
   * A month later, in December, Rivian recently announced a pilot deal to sell an undisclosed number of EDV‚Äôs to AT&T. This shot Rivian‚Äôs share price up and made investors happy. This could lead to a much larger deal in the future.
   * I strongly suspect that several more pilot programs with other delivery companies will be announced in the coming months. Over time these deals will mature and large orders will be placed.

&#x200B;

* **Attractive Price** \- In 2021, Rivian made its IPO during the EV stimulus-uphoria at $78/share. I did not buy a single share back then. That sounded crazy overpriced for an unproven capital-intensive car company. The share price immediately jumped near to $130/share and it has done nothing but go down ever since. It‚Äôs down over 85% to $15.50. We are close to its all-time lows. I think this presents an amazing opportunity to buy at a discount.
   * Rivian‚Äôs Value Compared to Competitors ‚Äì Right now, Rivian‚Äôs market cap is $14.5 billion. This is small compared to Ford‚Äôs at $44 billion, GM‚Äôs at $47 billion, and Stellantis at $63 billion. While Rivian clearly sells less vehicles than these competitors, Rivian‚Äôs future is much brighter. I suspect a forward-looking stock market will quickly buy shares of Rivian over the next three years if it continues to make strong gains. While it will take a long time for the market to see Rivian as a premier competitor like Tesla or Toyota, I can easily see Rivian‚Äôs market cap soaring past Ford, GM, & Stellantis in the next three years if it‚Äôs R2 launch is successful. 

&#x200B;

* **Tesla Supercharger Access**
   * Range anxiety is a real thing. Until America‚Äôs EV charging infrastructure is as dependable as gas stations, it‚Äôs going to be a big factor in the buying decision. Fortunately, Tesla has paved the way and built an amazing supercharging network across the country that is extremely dependable. While Rivian is building its own network (Rivian Adventure Network), it will never be as robust as Tesla‚Äôs. Until recently, Tesla chargers were for Tesla drivers only. But not anymore‚Ä¶.
   * Tesla recently announced it was going to permit competitors vehicles like Rivian to access and use its network. This is enormous news for future buyers as it will absolutely quell most of the range anxiety concerns.
   * Rivian also announced it was adopting Tesla‚Äôs North American Charging Standard plug. This is the plug that Tesla uses on its vehicles. Starting in 2025, Rivian vehicles will come standard with this plug. I don‚Äôt know about you, but I think this will help hundreds of thousands of people make the decision to switch from an ICE car to an EV. 

If you‚Äôve been around the market for any length of time at all, you know that the stock market is forward looking. It is constantly trying to figure out what the future holds based on all available data and placing its bet accordingly. I think most of the seven points I just made are largely unappreciated or discounted by the smart people in suits. And that is why the share price is lower than it should be. That is where our opportunity lies.  
  
However, this investing thing is not for weaklings‚Ä¶.

# Point #5 ‚Äì Not Gonna Lie‚Ä¶ There Are Big Risks:

I‚Äôm not some delusional nerd who doesn‚Äôt understand how hard it is to make accurate predictions like this. There are some big risks here. These are the biggest ones that I see:

&#x200B;

* **What if the R2 Vehicle Announcement Falls Flat?**
   * When the R2 is announced on March 7th, it‚Äôs possible that the reaction will be poor. The SUV could look terrible, the specs could be unappealing, or the price could be too high. 
   * I think this is unlikely. Considering the care, consideration, and thought that has gone into the R1S and R1T, I expect the R2 to be a big hit and a full extension of the outdoor-adventure brand.

&#x200B;

* **What if there is a Demand Problem?** 
   * It‚Äôs possible there is a demand problem for the R1 vehicles and the sales are not as good as I believe they are. It‚Äôs possible that inventory is rising. In early January 2024 Rivian announced it produced 17,541 and delivered 13,972 in Q4 2023. When these numbers were announced, the stock dropped 10%. 
   * Why the 3,569 difference? Well, between making a vehicle and selling it to a customer, it takes some time to sell, ship, and for the customer to take possession. For vehicles made in December, you can easily imagine some of those don‚Äôt actually get delivered until January. 
   * But why 3,569? That seems like a lot to account for that simple lag between production and delivery. According to the Q3 earnings call, the CFO said, ‚ÄúAs a reminder, because Amazon limits the intake of new commercial vans during its peak holiday delivery period, we expect a more significant gap between production and deliveries in Q4 relative to prior periods.‚Äù I find this explanation pretty satisfying. 
   * But if this large gap remains at the end of Q1 2024, or grows, I‚Äôm gonna start to get worried.

&#x200B;

* **What if Building the Georgia Plant Runs into Problems?**
   * It‚Äôs possible that there are major roadblocks to building the brand new R2 plant in Georgia. My imagination can go wild thinking about delays, permits, politics, protests, bureaucracy, accidents, and the ‚Äúproduction hell‚Äù issues that Elon Musk talks about. 
   * The good thing is that Rivian has gone through the production process on three different vehicles in Illinois and that experience should speed the process up. But who knows what kind of disasters could come up building a plant from scratch.

&#x200B;

* **What if the March to Profitability Stalls or Reverses?**
   * It‚Äôs possible that Rivian‚Äôs current march to profitability will slow to a crawl, stop, or reverse entirely. This would be bad. In the next quarter earnings statement on February 21st, Rivian better post a smaller loss than $30,600 per vehicle (Q3 2023). It better be in the mid $20k or better‚Ä¶ Absent a really good and logical explanation, I‚Äôm going to be seriously alarmed if it doesn‚Äôt get somewhere in that range.
   * If this happens, that would be a strong signal that Rivian is just making too good of a car and they either need to increase the price, or make it cheaper.
   * I honestly doubt this will happen. The way the CEO and CFO handle their earnings calls inspires confidence in their managerial ability. But that is my suuuuper subjective perspective. 

&#x200B;

* **What if they Issue More Debt and/or Dilution?** 
   * Rivian will probably have to raise more money to complete the plant in Georgia. But they are going to spend $5 billion to build the R2 plant in Georgia and they need to continue ramping production in Illinois. That‚Äôs a ton in capital outlay. 
   * Luckily, that fat IPO set Rivian up nice. Currently, Rivian has very little debt ($3bil) and a strong balance sheet (they have like $8-9 billion in cash/equivalents).
   * But raising capital will either come in the form of more debt or share dilution. Either way, it won‚Äôt be great for the owners of the stock. But Wall Street already knows this, so nobody is going to freak out if it‚Äôs a small capital raise. But if its huge, yeah, I‚Äôm gonna freak out too.

&#x200B;

* **What if Interest Rates Rise?** 
   * Inflation could spike back up like it did in the 70‚Äôs. That would prompt the fed to raise interest rates again. I think this is unlikely, but it would be a bad for every auto company if it happened.

&#x200B;

* **What if Repair Cost Fears Grow?** 
   * The last big risk is something I don‚Äôt hear very many investment folk talk about. Repair costs.
   * Repair costs seem to be very high for EV vehicles, and Rivian‚Äôs in particular. There are many stories of a medium size dent on a fender costing the customer $20-30k. This kind of stuff, if true, will drive up insurance costs. This is a red flag/danger area that will deter some cautious buyers. 
   * I‚Äôm not terribly worried about this. In theory, as more cars get made, repair costs will go down. But this will take time.

# Point #6 - Rivian is Not the Next Tesla (But it Doesn‚Äôt Have to Be)

I feel like everyone just wants to compare Rivian to Tesla. I think that is unwise when evaluating this investment.

Rivian only produced 57,000 vehicles in 2023. In the same timeframe, Tesla produced 1,850,000. These two companies are not even in the same universe. Tesla is at least 7-10 years ahead of Rivian. But that doesn‚Äôt matter at all for the question of whether or not you should own Rivian stock.

The great thing here is that if Tesla continues to win with the Model Y and Cybertruck, that will likely be a net benefit for Rivian. Tesla has smashed the entrenched auto-industry to bits, and Rivian is poised to take advantage of rebuilding it in the new vision of the future. The customer needs alternatives to Tesla. And Rivian is better positioned to capture market share from Subaru, Jeep, Land Rover, Toyota, Chevorlet and other brands that make adventure style trucks and SUV‚Äôs.

Tesla‚Äôs stock went from $15 a share in September of 2019 to $235 by the end of 2020. That meteoric rise was the result of a decade of work, becoming profitable, and the stimulus froth of the Covid recovery. Even if Rivian smashes its forecasts for the next two years, Rivian stock will not do what Tesla did. Tesla is so much more than a car company. As it stands, Rivian is just a car company‚Ä¶.

But I do believe Rivian could easily get back to its IPO price in the of $70‚Äôs if it executes well on its vision over the next 2-3 years. That is what I‚Äôm hoping for. 

# Conclusion

I spent all day writing this. I‚Äôm tired of typing. I hope someone out there can poke some holes in my thesis so I can sell my shares and put my $$ back into an index fund where it belongs. But I also hope that I‚Äôm right and this stock gradually rises in value over the next few years. Right now I‚Äôm committed. I‚Äôm freaking pumped about it. 

Maybe I‚Äôm just dumb and this whole idea is terrible‚Ä¶. If you think I'm missing something, please feel free to tell me in the comments below.

But I have my doubts. Does anyone here have a portfolio older than 1 year that is beating the S&P 500 over the same time period?

I have been experimenting with a few basic strategies since last summer. Then I found paper trading and I decided to put them to the test. I created several portfolios last July. 

Very quickly I could see how the random stock picking portfolio based on recommendations was garbage. 

Then I came across the basic ETF strategies. So I made a Voo and chill portfolio, an 80/20 Boglehead portfolio and 6 portfolios based on MPT. They mostly all hold 6 tickets but one has 12. They are all high Sharpe ratio and have low variance because I chose stocks with very low correlation. 

All portfolios started at $50,000 and I made the lump sum purchases on July 28th. 

-The Boglehead is the worst performer, being up 3.35%. 

- Voo is +6.17%

Then the MPT portfolios range from +16.64% to +27.05%. 

Tonight I will record the results and reset the board and try again starting with today. 

Are there any retail investors managing their own portfolios who are beating the market?",2024-01-25,0

**Year-Over-Year Comparison:**  
Revenue and Profit Decline: There was a notable decline in both revenue and profit year-over-year, indicating challenging market conditions in 2023.

2022 Performance: The stock may have been positively influenced by the company's solid performance in automotive and industrial segments, along with generous shareholder returns.

**Overall Insights:**  
Texas Instruments has faced significant challenges in 2023, with decreased revenue and profitability compared to 2022.  
The company's strategic focus remains on the industrial and automotive sectors, but the industrial sector has shown weakness in 2023.

1367,Peacock gained 2.8mil subs from NFL playoff in one day. ESPN clocks 6 of its 7 most-viewed games ever just in the past two seasons.,53,19etgi6,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/19etgi6/peacock_gained_28mil_subs_from_nfl_playoff_in_one/,36,"***.....................correction: 2.8 million over 3 days, not 1 day.***

*\*****Peacock****:*

*Earlier this month, NBC Universal said the NFL playoff game it streamed (mostly) exclusively on Peacock, its streaming service, was a huge success.*

*NBC and its parent company, Comcast, backed up that claim by citing ratings ‚Äî it drew some 23 million viewers ‚Äî and self-generated statistics about internet usage during the game. Crucially, it didn't say how many people signed up (and paid for) Peacock to watch the game.*

*Now we (probably) know: Peacock signed up nearly 3 million subscribers for the game. That's according to subscription tracking service Antenna, which says 2.8 million people signed up over a three-day window leading up to the January 13 game. Antenna says that's the biggest sign-up around a ""singular programming event"" it has ever seen. (It says Disney+ signed up 2.5 million people on its launch day in 2019, though Disney announced 10 million signups. You can read about Antenna's methodology and the possible difference between those numbers here.)*

*A Comcast rep declined to comment on Antenna's report. Comcast reports earnings on Thursday. So, yes: It appears that despite the many complaints you may have heard or seen, putting a very high-profile NFL playoff game (featuring shots of Taylor Swift cheering on Travis Kelce) on a paid streaming service will induce people to sign up for that service.*

*The next big question: How many of those folks will stick around and keep paying after the game ‚Äî especially because churn is a major issue for streamers? We won't know that answer for a while.*

*According to ESPN, the Texans-Ravens game bested the NFL game marks from all Disney-owned channel broadcasts, excluding Super Bowls. This includes games played on ABC. The company aired Super Bowl XXXIV, Super Bowl XXXVI and Super Bowl XL.*

*NBC‚Äôs broadcast of the Miami Dolphins falling to the Kansas City Chiefs in the wild-card round exclusively on Peacock drew 23 million viewers, making it the most-streamed game in NFL history.

It was also addressed by* [*Citibank*](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/three-remains-why-analyst-neutral-151413530.html) *after downgrading Netflix to ""Neutral"". Both inputs made after the latest earnings call reporting a gain of 13 million subs, most of which is international.*

*The number of households password-sharing was reported by Netflix to shareholders a few years ago and was reported by* [*Forbes*](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2023/02/09/netflix-password-sharing-everything-you-need-to-know/?sh=2d9cb77963b0)*; worldwide, there's* ***100 million households*** *password-sharing of whom* ***30 million households*** *are in the US/Canada. It's also been monitored by market research companies which reported an uptick in cancellations overwhelmed by an uptick in registrations.*

***Clearing House collaborated with MoffettNathanson to*** [*survey*](https://www.lightreading.com/video-streaming/study-netflix-s-password-sharing-crackdown-poised-to-add-subs-and-revenues) ***19k people (3 months ago):*** *22% to 32% of the 30 million Netflix password-sharing users will become new paying subscribers. ""Of course, people's intentions change ... but if Netflix is able to entice 25% of current sharers to re-subscribe to their ad-tier, that would translate to 6.8 million net adds and $567 million in incremental annual subscription revenue,"" MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson explained in the report (registration required). ""Net-net, so while this might not be the home run that the Bulls might believe, the near-term opportunity to continue adding subscribers in North America seems very likely. ""The survey found that 23% of accounts that engage in password-sharing have received a notice from the streamer that they are in violation of the new policy. Of that group, about 72% have since lost access to their shared account. ""This implies Netflix has ample room to go in rolling out warnings and enforcement of this measure,"" Nathanson wrote. But he allows that there's some squishiness in those findings since it's possible that some survey respondents might not be fully aware they are in violation of Netflix's new rules. Among the group that currently shares a subscription and has not yet lost access to a shared account, 22% either plan to get their own subscription or have already done so. That's a possible indicator that ""when push comes to shove, many find themselves missing their Netflix access more than they had thought,"" Nathanson surmised.*

***So we know the numbers to draw from are massive*** *(100 million): and these are the* ***gains of subs*** *over the last 4 quarters:* ***Q1***: *1.75mil*, ***Q2***: *5.89mil*, ***Q3***: *9mil*, ***Q4***: *13mil*.

*It stands to reason that the ""content"" threshold to convert a freeloader to a subscriber is lower than the acquisition of a new subscriber from a competitive market. It's also true that Netflix had to actively entice a freeloader to convert with good content. So is reducing content next year prudent?*

*How much of this growth is password-sharing crackdown? and how much of it is left to draw from? what do the numbers look like going forward? Disney started password sharing crackdown in Canada last November, what should we expect from Disney?*

24M about to graduate in and get my bachelor in Business Economics & Management; recently I found a nice hobby: stock valuation and analysis

Today I am presenting you COSTCO. If you need the excel file to look into my calculations just DM me! Let's start!

What is COSTCO?

It is a multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of membership-only warehouse clubs. The company is one of the largest retailers in the world and is known for its unique business model and emphasis on providing value to its customers. Key aspects of what the company does are:

1. **Membership-Based Model**: Costco operates on a membership-based system. Customers need to pay an annual fee to become members, and in return, they gain access to the exclusive deals and discounts offered by the store.
2. **Warehouse Club**s: Costco's stores are warehouse-style retail outlets where customers can purchase a wide variety of products in bulk. These products range from groceries and household items to electronics, appliances, clothing, and more.
3. **Low Prices**: Costco is renowned for its commitment to offering high-quality products at low prices. The company achieves this by selling items in larger quantities, thereby reducing packaging costs and passing the savings on to customers.
4. **Private Label Products**: Costco sells a significant number of private-label or in-house brands. These are products that carry the Costco brand name.
5. **Rotating Inventory**: Costco frequently changes its product selection, introducing new items and removing others. This approach can be seen by its average Inventory Turnover of 12
6. **Services**: In addition to retail products, Costco offers a range of services, including travel bookings, insurance, and optical and pharmacy services. They also have a popular food court known for its low-cost food items.

Analyzing its Financial Statements, I can say that Costco's has a **Fair Value of 571$**

|**Asset to Equity**|2,97 x|3,28 x|3,11 x|2,75 x|**3,03 x**|

Main Observations (expanding the analysis in the excel file, I just show the 3 main components here):

* Something is eating gross profit margin, thus it makes me thing the cost of goods have increased in the last two years;
* Net Profit margin is stable in the last four years, making me thing it would be in 2024 too
* Observing in the asset part, we can see some issues in the Inventory Turnover and Account Receivable Turnover for 2022 that impacted negatively to the Cash Turnover for 2023
* The company is managing very well its asset

Knowing this, I will add a 2% growth rate to the base, bringing the **expected growth 28,94%** for the revenue

&#x200B;

# Conclusions

I still have to do some Benchmarking with the Industry and Peers to better adjust the numbers and observe analysts expectations for 2024's market, leaving it here for you all to criticise and give tips and opinions, I am still new to those kind of stuff and it is just an Hobby for me, for now

Wouldn‚Äôt creating a sliding tax on corporations who sell goods with over 100% margins get them to reduce prices further?

I get the logistics would be extremely difficult to determine margins etc but not impossible and if manipulated they could be fined.

I just don‚Äôt see how there are any incentives for reducing prices when they make record profits even if housing and car prices go down.

If interest rates go down people have more money to spend and get reduced rate loans which allows them to buy more at these higher margins.

Seattle Times aerospace reporter

The fuselage panel that blew off an Alaska Airlines jet earlier this month was removed for repair then reinstalled improperly by Boeing mechanics on the Renton final assembly line, a person familiar with the details of the work told The Seattle Times.

If verified by the National Transportation Safety Board investigation, this would leave Boeing primarily at fault for the accident, rather than its supplier Spirit AeroSystems, which originally installed the panel into the 737 MAX 9 fuselage in Wichita, Kan.

That panel, a door plug used to seal a hole in the fuselage sometimes used to accommodate an emergency exit, blew out of Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 as it climbed out of Portland on Jan. 5. The hair-raising incident drew fresh and sharp criticism of Boeing‚Äôs quality control systems and safety culture, which has been under the microscope since two fatal 737 MAX crashes five years ago.

Last week, an anonymous whistleblower ‚Äî who appears to have access to Boeing‚Äôs manufacturing records of the work done assembling the specific Alaska Airlines jet that suffered the blowout ‚Äî on an aviation website separately provided many additional details about how the door plug came to be removed and then mis-installed.

‚ÄúThe reason the door blew off is stated in black and white in Boeing‚Äôs own records,‚Äù the whistleblower wrote. ‚ÄúIt is also very, very stupid and speaks volumes about the quality culture at certain portions of the business.‚Äù

The self-described Boeing insider said company records show four bolts that prevent the door plug from sliding up off the door frame stop pads that take the pressurization loads in flight, ‚Äúwere not installed when Boeing delivered the airplane.‚Äù the whistleblower stated. ‚ÄúOur own records reflect this.‚Äù

NTSB investigators already publicly raised the possibility that the bolts had not been installed.

The account goes on to describe shocking lapses in Boeing‚Äôs quality control process in Renton.

The work of the mechanics on the door plug should have been formally inspected and signed off by a Boeing quality inspector.

It wasn‚Äôt, the whistleblower wrote, because of a process failure and the use of two separate systems to record what work was accomplished.

Boeing‚Äôs 737 production system is described as ‚Äúa rambling, shambling, disaster waiting to happen.‚Äù

If that account of what happened is indeed fully documented in Boeing‚Äôs system it should be readily verified by the investigation.

The Seattle Times offered Boeing the opportunity to dispute the details in this story. Citing the ongoing investigation, Boeing declined to comment. Likewise, so did Spirit, the FAA, the Machinists union and the NTSB.",2024-01-24,0

* Many large businesses have shown interest in owning their AI computing system for privacy and security reasons, but Nvidia systems are different from conventional data center servers, often using different networking cabling and requiring liquid cooling.

* Under the deal, Nvidia has trained Equinix staff in how to build and run its systems. Corporate customers will purchase Nvidia systems but pay Equinix to build and run them efficiently while still retaining ownership.

1386,Boeing plans safety ‚Äòstand down‚Äô as United reconsiders 737 MAX orders,207,19e8gap,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/19e8gap/boeing_plans_safety_stand_down_as_united/,89,"By Lauren Rosenblatt 
Seattle Times staff reporter

On the same day United Airlines said it would consider alternatives to Boeing for its next airplane order, the manufacturer announced a one-day work pause at its Renton factory for employees to learn and focus on quality assurance. 

Boeing 737 MAX workers from the production, delivery and support teams in Renton will spend Thursday participating in working sessions, the company said on Tuesday. It is the first of many ‚ÄúQuality Stand Down‚Äù days Boeing will host over the next few weeks at its factories. 

Employees will participate in ‚Äúhands-on learning, reflection and collaboration,‚Äù Boeing wrote in a note sent to all commercial airplanes employees and posted on its website. The goal is to identify quality and compliance improvements and create actionable plans, according to the note.

Stan Deal, Boeing Commercial Airplanes chief executive officer, said in a statement the sessions will allow ‚Äúall teammates who touch the airplane to pause, evaluate what we‚Äôre doing, how we‚Äôre doing it and make recommendations for improvement.‚Äù 

The pause is part of a list of immediate actions Boeing plans to take following the Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 safety incident earlier this month when a panel blew off an 737 MAX 9 fuselage midflight. That panel was a door plug filling a space that some airlines use as an emergency exit. 

The flight landed safely in Portland but the incident has heightened scrutiny of Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems, Boeing‚Äôs supplier that builds MAX fuselages.

The Federal Aviation Administration grounded the 737 MAX 9 planes that fill the open space with a door plug shortly after the incident. Those planes, flown by Alaska Airlines and United in the U.S., will remain grounded until they are inspected, following instructions from Boeing and the FAA.

On Sunday, the FAA recommended airlines also inspect another, older Boeing model ‚Äî the 737-900ER ‚Äî that has the same door plug design. 

Since the fuselage blowout, Boeing has said it will implement additional inspections as its planes are built, work alongside teams at Spirit to ensure door plugs are properly installed and open its factories to additional oversight. It also hired Admiral Kirkland Donald to lead a third-party review of Boeing‚Äôs quality management system. 

‚ÄúWe have taken important steps in recent years to strengthen our Quality Management System‚Äôs foundation and its layers of protection. But the AS1282 accident and recent customer findings make clear that we are not where we need to be,‚Äù Deal wrote in a message to employees last week. 

Alaska and United Airlines both found loose hardware related to the door plug as they began inspecting other planes in their fleets.

On Tuesday morning, United CEO Scott Kirby indicated the airline would consider options other than Boeing for its next airplane order. 

In an interview with CNBC, Kirby said the airline was about five years behind its original order for Boeing‚Äôs MAX 10 plane. After the MAX 9 incident, United has begun crafting a new plan that doesn‚Äôt include Boeing‚Äôs MAX 10, he said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm disappointed that the manufacturing challenges do keep happening at Boeing. This isn‚Äôt new,‚Äù Kirby said. ‚ÄúI think the MAX grounding is probably the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back.‚Äù

The MAX 10, the largest of the four-model MAX line, and the MAX 7 have yet to receive FAA approval to carry passengers.

Alaska Airlines CEO Ben Minicucci said in an NBC interview Tuesday afternoon he was ‚Äúmore than frustrated. ‚Ä¶ My demand on Boeing is, what are they going to do to improve their quality programs in-house?‚Äù 

Meanwhile, the union representing machinists and aerospace workers at Boeing said Tuesday it had delayed contract negotiations amid the fuselage blowout inspection. Both International Association of Machinists District 751 and Boeing are named as independent parties in the National Transportation Safety Board‚Äôs investigation into the incident. 

Contract negotiations were supposed to begin in early February but are now delayed until early March.",2024-01-24,0

 ‚Äî 
Alaska Airlines CEO Ben Minicucci revealed the carrier found ‚Äúsome loose bolts on many‚Äù Boeing 737 Max 9s in an interview for ‚ÄúNBC Nightly News with Lester Holt‚Äù scheduled to air Tuesday.

It‚Äôs the CEO‚Äôs first interview since a door plug on one of its Max 9 airplanes shot out from the side of the fuselage only a few minutes into a flight from Portland, Oregon, to Ontario, California, forcing the pilot to make an emergency landing.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm more than frustrated and disappointed. I am angry. This happened to Alaska Airlines. It happened to our guests and happened to our people,‚Äù Minicucci said, according to excerpts released ahead of the interview‚Äôs airing.

Boeing‚Äôs 737 factory will have what the company calls a ‚Äúquality stand down‚Äù at its Renton, Washington facility Thursday, the company announced Tuesday.

‚ÄúDuring the session, production, delivery and support teams will pause for a day so employees can take part in working sessions focused on quality. This is part of the immediate quality actions recently shared by Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stan Deal,‚Äù the company said in a statement.

The internal notice Boeing sent to its employees indicates that the 737 stand down is the first of several that it will hold at its facilities.

NBC asked Minicucci if Boeing has a problem with quality control extending beyond a single plane.

‚ÄúI think this is the issue that‚Äôs at question right here, which is what is Boeing going to do differently on their quality program, to make sure that when we get an airplane, it‚Äôs at the highest degree of excellence and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs got to be different going forward,‚Äù he said.

He added that the company is adding its own extra oversight on the airplane maker‚Äôs production line.

The US Federal Aviation Administration urged airlines on Sunday to inspect so-called door plugs on an earlier version of Boeing 737 airplanes. After recent inspections of the newer Max 9s, United Airlines and Alaska Airlines have found loose bolts.

FAA opened a formal investigation into Boeing‚Äôs quality control around two weeks ago. The agency said it continued to review data collected from inspections of 40 sample aircraft as it considered how to determine if the planes were safe to fly again.

Minicucci noted in the interview that the inspections take about 10 hours per door.

In a statement, Stan Deal, the CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said: ‚ÄúWe have let down our airline customers and are deeply sorry for the significant disruption to them, their employees and their passengers. We are taking action on a comprehensive plan to bring these airplanes safely back to service and to improve our quality and delivery performance. We will follow the lead of the FAA and support our customers every step of the way.‚Äù

The CEO of United Airlines, one of the biggest buyers of Boeing jets, also expressed frustration with the company.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm disappointed that‚Ä¶ this keeps happening at Boeing. This isn‚Äôt new,‚Äù said Scott Kirby, CEO of United, in an interview Tuesday on CNBC. ‚ÄúWe need Boeing to succeed. But they‚Äôve been having these consistent manufacturing challenges. They need to take action here.‚Äù

United has 79 of the Max 9s, more than any other airline, and had originally scheduled nearly 8,000 flights with the plane for this month before the incident, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics firm. Boeing‚Äôs future is also uncertain regarding orders for the 737 Max 10, a newer, larger version and more expensive version of the 737 Max that has yet to be certified by the FAA.

‚ÄúI think the Max 9 grounding is probably the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back for us,‚Äù said Kirby. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to build a plan that doesn‚Äôt have the Max 10 in it.‚Äù

I'll pay more hefty P/E multiples (albeit, not crazy) for those companies but it's not a big issue for me, so long as the business is capable of reinvesting those earnings at high rates of return. It strikes me as the Charlie Munger/Terry Smith strategy.

These companies are very difficult to shake off their moats. Unfortunately if they are meaningfully disrupted it may be brutal. Risk is limited by the fact that it's really fucking hard to do that.

Notable examples in my Roth account: Constellation Software, FICO, WM, and railways. I can set them and forget them until I'm 65, and even with the P/E dropping the ""E"" in that equation will compound until I die.

But this strategy seems to run afoul of value investors like Mohnish Pabrai, Aswath Damodaran, Benjaman Graham, and others like them. They like to take on companies that the market has mispriced significantly, where the margin of safety between the price and value limits risk. In other words, the risk is limited by the idea that the price *cannot* drop significantly over the long term from its present value.

The more I think about it however they seem terribly over valued. Lets take for example Marathon digital holdings. The company owns 15,174 BTC , Mined about 1,800 BTC in 2023 and has a market cap of 3.62 Billion. That means it cost you about $238,565 per bitcoin when BTC sits at 39k if you were to just buy it.  
  
Lets be VERY generous and say even in spite of the halving marathon manages to triple its BTC mined per year bringing the total mined up 5,400 BTC per year. If they mined at this rate for 10 years and didn't sell any to cover costs they would hold approximately 69,174 BTC. Multiply 69174 x 39,500=$2,732,373,000  
  
That is a BTC value of 2.73 billion. From a value investing perspective this is a terrible investment when someone has the ability to buy MicroStrategy A ETF or just hold bitcoin directly in cold storage. Am I missing something here? I am not saying don't buy them, they may go sky high from wild speculation in the next cycle but the numbers don't add up.

Netflix is still navigating its transformation from targeting subscriber growth to focusing on profit, using price hikes, password crackdowns and ad-supported tiers to boost revenue. Investors got a sneak preview of growth in Netflix‚Äôs advertising-based plan earlier this month, when the company‚Äôs president of advertising, Amy Reinhard, told attendees at the Variety Entertainment Summit at CES that the company now has more than 23 million global monthly active users. That‚Äôs up from 15 million that the company reported in November.

It‚Äôs been less than a year since Netflix instituted its password crackdown, so it‚Äôs unclear how it has affected the company‚Äôs results and how much executives will share about it.",2024-01-23,0

I get the difference, but I was wondering why there isn‚Äôt (or if there is) a stock type or financial tool where a buyer can direct the returns towards a certain department within the company. Say Research & Development for instance. Does this make sense? If I as a buyer feel a certain department is underfunded - is there a way to support that department through some kind of security?

***\*Marvel - Insomniac licensing terms for an upcoming game (X-men; one of 4 upcoming)***:

*In the late 2010's Iger closed Disney's gaming divisions retaining a small staff whose sole function is to license out & creatively cooperate and supervise: Marvel Games, Lucasfilm Games...etc*. *The 2010's saw a shift in video gaming where emphasis shifted to making few games but of supreme quality, narrative and graphics. These games today are incredibly expensive costing at times $200-300mil*. *One of those games is Spiderman2 just released to become the fastest selling video game in Playstation history*. *In the leaks, licensing terms are defined by Marvel for the game developer:*

***-Conditions on budget:*** *each game gets at least* ***$120 million*** *for production and* ***$30*** *million for marketing.*

*-****Exclusivity:*** *Disney doesn't release licensed characters in any other video game; total of 4 up until* ***2035****.*

***-Marvel Royalties:*** *several tiers depending on number of sales. If sales are above 7 million units: Disney gets* ***26% of net digital sales*** *(includes DLCs),* ***18% of physical sales***\*, and finally\* ***50% of bundled games***\*.\*

*Disney has multiple deals with multiple game developers simultaneously. Marvel for example has deals with other game developers like Bethesda in addition to Insomniac. This also includes Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Avatar...etc. All that royalty almost completely goes to their bottom line having only to finance a small staff for licensing.*

***\*Microsoft's acquisition of Activision will leapfrog Sony past their current pillars:***

*Sony allegedly goes into detail about how it views Microsoft's position moving forward. Described by Sony as ""the leapfrog,"" the slide details how Microsoft is aiming to build a mobile gaming store to compete with Apple and Google, as per previous information. It also details how Microsoft could build a comprehensive ecosystem across mobile, PC, and console, referring to Xbox Game Pass as ""GP"" throughout. Sony details how its ""pillars"" are ""dated,"" and behind Microsoft, referring to Microsoft's growing service game portfolio across titles like Sea of Thieves, Halo Infinite, and Minecraft. Sony also notes its need to ""respond,"" although its service game efforts have hit snags recently, with Destiny's upcoming expansion delayed, and The Last of Us Online wholly cancelled.*

..............

***\*Video games have become more and more expensive, similar to films, compelling a change in strategy:***

*Sony details how difficult it's getting to actually get a return on investment for AAA games ‚Äî an issue that is plaguing the entire industry right now. Sony expresses how a $500 million game might not break even in the first year, which is upending how publishers are thinking about platforms like PC and mobile as they seek profitability and less risky investments.*

*To that end, Sony's ""strategic pillars"" seem to detail an intent to eventually launch games more quickly, or even day one on Windows PCs, as part of its multi-platform pillar.*

Netflix and TKO Group Holdings said Tuesday that the streaming platform will air the WWE‚Äôs flagship program Raw starting next year, in Netflix‚Äôs first major foray into live sports.

Netflix, which is trying to drive revenue by cutting down on subscription sharing and pushing viewers toward its ad-tier membership, has made few attempts at live programming in its history. Adding Raw, which currently airs on USA Network, to its programming lineup will be a boon to the platform.


Raw is the top program on USA, drawing 17.5 million unique viewers per year, the companies said.

Separately Tuesday, the WWE‚Äôs parent company TKO announced actor and former wrestling superstar Dwayne Johnson would join its board of directors.

*Something weird happened in the streaming market at the end of 2023. For the last two years, the percentage of U.S. households using streaming services has hovered between 80% and 83% each quarter, leading analysts to believe it had reached its peak. But new data from analytics company HarrisX shows that after taking a small dip in the third quarter of 2023, the statistic popped to 85% at the end of last year, raising the tantalizing possibility that there‚Äôs more room for growth.*  
  
*‚ÄúThis is counter to our prior narrative that streaming reached a peak in the U.S.,‚Äù said analysts at MoffettNathanson, a New York-based media investment firm, in a research report published on Monday.*  
  
*The reason for the uptick in streamers is unclear, though there are many plausible causes: The arrival of lower-cost advertising tiers, Black Friday discounts, and Netflix‚Äôs password-sharing crackdown could all have played a role, the analysts said.*  
  
*And while last year‚Äôs Hollywood labor union strikes could have led consumers, dismayed by the lack of new shows, to cancel their streaming subscriptions, the opposite could also be true. For certain cable TV subscribers, the delay of new content across the television industry may have provided an excuse to cut the cord and switch to a cheaper streaming plan instead, the analysts theorized.*  
  
*The news comes ahead of quarterly earnings results for the major streaming companies, including Netflix on Tuesday, and Peacock owner Comcast on Thursday. Apple is set to report earnings next week, with other streamers following in February.*  
  
*As the first streaming company to report earnings this year, Netflix will set the tone for what‚Äôs to come. Analysts expect the company to post quarterly revenue of $8.71 billion, an 11% increase from the same quarter last year, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. They also estimate 8.91 million subscriber additions, beating the 7.7 million added the same quarter last year and just shy of Netflix‚Äôs 9 million third quarter addition.*  
  
***Anomalous blip or surprising upside?***  
*American households on average subscribe to four streaming platforms, which has remained consistent over the last two years, according to MoffettNathanson. This lack of growth in recent years means that companies have primarily battled for each other‚Äôs customers rather than hunting for newbies ‚Äì a zero sum game, according to the analysts.*  
  
*Indeed, there has been evidence that streaming fatigue has already hit, with consumers frustrated over hiked prices, increased ads, and decreased quality, Fortune previously reported. And as prices continue to rise and platforms increasingly share content with each other, the number of services each household pays for has the potential to tick back down, analysts reckon.*  
  
*The increase in streaming penetration during the fourth quarter was a positive surprise. But it remains to be seen whether it signals a new opportunity for market growth or a small, anomalous blip in a saturated market. Whatever the case, MoffettNathanson's analysts said in the report, ""streaming ended 2023 with a nice tailwind.""*

Red Sea crisis continues to affect many sectors across the world. Diversion via Cape of Good Hope (i.e. skip the faster route via Suez Canal) requires huge supply of oil and other necessities throughout the voyage. The additional cost and time inevitably damage companies' profits as well as pump up inflation.

&#x200B;

**BLOOMBERG: Chaos in the Red Sea Is Starting to Bite Into Companies‚Äô Profits**

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-23/shipping-chaos-tesla-tesco-others-warn-of-impact](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-23/shipping-chaos-tesla-tesco-others-warn-of-impact)

*With the Red Sea crisis roiling shipments of everything from cars to energy, it‚Äôs only a matter of time before soaring costs and supply-chain strains show up in companies‚Äô earnings reports.*

*Several firms are already warning of the impact. Electric vehicle maker Tesla plans a two-week production halt at a German plant due shipment delays, while Sweden‚Äôs Volvocar AB has announced a three-day stoppage at its Belgian factory. British retailers Tesco, Marks & Spencer Group and Next have all flagged the risk of higher prices for consumers.*

*This is due to at least 2,300 ships taking lengthy detours to avoid Houthi militants‚Äô attacks in the Red Sea ‚Äî a waterway that normally handles over 12% of global sea trade. Central bankers are warning of an inflation surge that could hamper interest-rate cuts. For many companies, especially in Europe, it‚Äôs adding to transit times, padding out freight bills and raising insurance costs. It's also forcing analysts to rethink companies‚Äô earnings estimates for the coming year.*

*In the past three months, the consensus forecast for car-makers‚Äô earnings is down 5%, data shows. Shippers on the other hand are emerging as winners ‚Äî with container rates surging 300% on some routes, earnings estimates for MSCI Europe‚Äôs transportation index have risen 7% in just two weeks.*

*Thomas Brenier, head of equities at Lazard Freres Gestion in Paris, has trimmed exposure to the auto sector, seeing it as ""one of the first to suffer due to its complex and tense supply chain.‚Äù He is also avoiding retail, as it ""could suffer from a lack of products to sell.‚Äù*

*""If it lasts another one or two months, for sure you will see some profit warnings linked to this,‚Äù Brenier predicted.*

*Here‚Äôs a look at how earnings could shape up for various sectors:*

*1. Shipping and insurance*

*It is estimated that current container shipping costs, if sustained, could add to headline inflation in the U.K. and euro area from late 2024 and early 2025.*

*But the events are boosting the fortunes of global shipping companies, such as AP Moller‚Äî Maersk A/S and Hapag-Lloyd AG in Europe, U.S.-listed ZIM Integrated Shipping and Japan‚Äôs Mitsui OSK Lines. Insurers should also benefit, with underwriters jacking up premiums tenfold on some shipping routes.*

*Among shippers, Maersk has enjoyed a slew of bullish recommendations. Bank of America recently doubled 2024 earnings estimates for the Danish firm, while Goldman Sachs Group reckons a massive increase in free-cash flow could allow it to return capital to shareholders.*

*David Vernon at Sanford C Bernstein and Co. predicts an earnings boost for logistics firms too, including freight forwarders, if companies that run out of shipping options resort to airfreight.*

*""Air freight are absolutely the winners,‚Äù Vernon said, naming FedEx, United Parcel Service and DHL Group as potential beneficiaries.*

*2. Retailers*

*Next, which sources most of its fashion and home products from Asia, was among the first retailers to voice fears of a hit.*

*Primark, which is owned by Associated British Foods, and Hennes & Mauritz AB are highly exposed to sea freight volumes, according to RBC Capital Markets analyst Richard Chamberlain, while Zara owner Inditex SA sources mostly from nearby countries. Similarly, Bryan Garnier & Co. highlights French furniture retailer Maisons du Monde SA as highly vulnerable, procuring 75% of its goods from Asia and transporting 90% by sea.*

*Prolonged disruption will pull in global brands such as Nike, Adidas AG and Capri Holdings, Bernstein said.*

*The problem for such companies is that the economic backdrop can make it harder to pass higher costs to consumers. ""Companies may have to absorb them, which would crimp profit margins,‚Äù Fr√©d√©rique Carrier at RBC Wealth Management said.*

*3. Autos*

*So far, Tesla and Volvo Car are the only auto makers to announce production stoppages. But such delays ""may represent a fresh risk to light vehicle production this year,‚Äù according to Morgan Stanley.*

*However, most reckon the industry won‚Äôt see a repeat of COVID-19 era problems. ""Costlier fuel, extra days of space rented, and higher shipping rates are going to be a negative on companies‚Äô P&Ls, but, putting this in perspective, transportation costs are about 57% lower than COVID levels,‚Äù BofA analyst John Murphy wrote.*

*The crisis could even allow automakers to maintain higher vehicle prices.*

*4. Energy*

*The impact on crude prices has been relatively muted this year, but that could change if a prolonged conflict causes supply shortfalls.*

*However, oil markets are bracing for weeks-long disruptions. Fewer tankers are traversing the Bab el-Mandeb strait at the southern end of the Red Sea, according to Vortexa data. The number of ships carrying crude or dirty petroleum products such as fuel oil, have slid by 25% this year up to Friday versus a year earlier, the figures show.*

Regardless of whether or not I put in information correctly for the computation, I'm genuinely curious what is driving this stock up.

* Net loss is steady quarter to quarter and the company doesn't expect positive net income in the near future.
* The price to book ratio is at an absurd 191, the highest competitor is below 5.
* Revenue is growing, however it is directly connected to bookings revenue, which is driven from Daily Average Users. At its current trends, this growth is roughly 20%. Based on the growth of expenses compared to revenue, I'm not sure how Roblox will be profitable without somehow growing sales exponentially.
* Recent litigation concerns regarding a class action from shareholders as well as a child safety lawsuit.
* The main positive I see is the amount of cash and not struggling with debt.

Does anyone have any insight as to what would justify this stock being $40? As of right now I'm tempted to buy a lengthy put position after the earnings release. Given the seasonality and strong sentiment for this stock, a bearish position might be cheap after that.

1407,How A.I. might improve IT service margins. Here a few stocks on my watchlist.,0,19dg6lh,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/19dg6lh/how_ai_might_improve_it_service_margins_here_a/,16,"Typically, IT services tend to be a very boring industry. There are a lot of sleeper stocks that compound capital with good cash flows. Nothing exciting happens here. They charge a premium to install software for clients in most cases. So naturally, investors tend to look for higher-margin software stocks.

But a few months ago, I remember hearing Chamath mention the impact of A.I. on IT outsourcing. And I don't think this idea has been revisited much. (I know the All-In ideas are controversial but this might be interesting to pick apart.)

First, we're familiar with the big names like IBM, Infosys and Accenture $IBM $INFY $ACN.  
  
Infosys and IBM have mid-teen profit margins with +30% returns on equity. Cognizant $CTSH and Accenture are similar. However I think the market underappreciates smaller players like TaskUs $TASK and RCM $RCMT. Both offer tech outsourcing in different verticals.  
  
TaskUs focuses on content moderation and security. RCM in specialty healthcare and engineering. RCMT is delivering 56% on equity with improving margins after the CEO turned the stock around.  
  
Now I don't think A.I. is priced in most of these IT service stocks. Both as a competitive advantage and disruptor. First up, the big names wont see much margin changes. But mid cap stocks like $CNXN $UIS $CDW might see further margin compression. Making those stocks painful to hold.

But TaskUs has a younger executive team with the cofounders still onboard. They caught the social media content wave early on and outsourced a lot of work to the Philippines. Trust & Safety was a big win for them. They also work in unique verticals like gaming.

I don't think they will pivot to software. But I do think the net profit margins can go beyond 4-5%. A 7% net profit margin is possible if they replace some talent with A.I. software. A 2-3% uptick doesn't seem like much but it's 40-50% higher than their current take rate. The stock price can reflect these margin improvements over the next 2-3 years. It will be slow but profitable.

Other names worth looking into are EPAM Systems $EPAM, Exlservice $EXLS and Genpact $G. All have more focused leadership with good historical performance.

1408,ADBE monetization of AI tools is terribly thought up,14,19dg1je,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/19dg1je/adbe_monetization_of_ai_tools_is_terribly_thought/,8,"Does Adobe plan on monetizing (raising prices) on its AI tools?  I've been watching some crazy videos on AI in Photoshop and it's stunning, so initially I was extremely bullish on ADBE, but then after researching their AI pricing, I see a lot of risk.

Pricing for generative AI is included in all their ""creative"" plans by way of credits, 500 credits for the cheapest plan ($20) and 1000 for the most expensive $60 (actually it's unlimited, just slow after using all your credits for the expensive plan, but will be enforced starting March 2024 [and other vague statements by Adobe here).](https://helpx.adobe.com/firefly/using/generative-credits-faq.html).

For the cheap plan adobe says you can just keep buying the $5 plan for 100 more credits, which I doubt many people will do as the smartest thing to do is buy a whole new plan at $20 for 500 credits.

There's several issues with how adobe came up with these pricing plans:

* They don't go into detail on ""enforcing"" limits and I think they'll just end up enraging their customer base in March
* Currently generative AI is free for a few of their plans, just slow after running out of credits, but again, that'll change in March
* You can just create new plans to avoid their terribly priced add-on plan; they should have just priced 1 credit at 4 or 5 cents or had an unlimited pricing plan with a higher limit for extreme users

Adobe revenue is at 19.37B and growth rate around 10%; the last earnings report in December lowered their guidance, so Adobe's own AI estimates internally is probably weak, so I don't really have huge expectations for 2024 for them.

There's a huge risk to Adobe & their Photoshop product in general as you can just give an AI the pic or video and have it re-process the whole thing, so it eliminates photoshop entirely!

So I see adobe's terrible pricing actually alienating their customers and they'll end up going somewhere else.  Midjourney and OpenAI's products for AI art are amazing and there's a dozen other smaller companies, so Adobe needs to get their shit together!",2024-01-23,0

* [BYD vs. Tesla market share.](https://i.imgur.com/oP0EnLO.png)


Chinese automaker expands its electric-vehicle lineup to more than 20 models in its push overseas and into higher price brackets

https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/a-lamborghini-style-ev-byd-goes-upmarket-to-outmaneuver-tesla-2b698578

HONG KONG‚Äî BYD overtook TSLA as the world‚Äôs top electric-vehicle seller by pumping out a range of affordable cars that gave Chinese drivers what they wanted: choice. 

Now it is moving into the luxury market as it prepares to take on the world.

BYD is releasing the cars under a different brand, Yangwang, marking a strategy shift from relying on lower-priced runarounds to producing less conventional vehicles that come with a hefty price tag. They include a $150,000 supercar that resembles a Lamborghini and an SUV that it says can rotate 360 degrees on the spot and float in water‚Äîfeatures that turn heads in China‚Äôs cutthroat car market where buyers chase the latest smart technology.

Tesla, meanwhile, banks on continuing strong global demand mostly for its Model 3 and Model Y cars, which it refreshed last year. Tesla‚Äôs Cybertruck, its first release in years, isn‚Äôt available in China, though the automaker is planning to take the vehicle on a roadshow in the country.

In China, the world‚Äôs biggest EV market, Tesla‚Äôs market share has been shrinking: BYD now sells five cars to every one that the U.S. automaker does. BYD‚Äôs popularity has surged as it cranks out new and varied models at a rapid pace, growing its portfolio of electric vehicles to more than two dozen models, catering to almost every taste and budget. 

Backed by Warren Buffett, BYD has become so dominant in its home market that sales in the country enabled it to dethrone Elon Musk‚Äôs automaker as the bestselling global EV brand last quarter.

BYD also has ambitious export and expansion plans. BYD has topped EV sales charts in Thailand and is quickly rising in markets including Australia and Israel. It is building factories in Brazil, Hungary and Thailand. Its first chartered cargo ship with a capacity for 7,000 vehicles set sail for Europe this month.

Whether BYD can repeat its home success on the global stage depends on whether it can translate the formula winning over Chinese buyers to international consumers. In the U.S., South Korean carmakers Hyundai Motor and Kia are emerging as Tesla‚Äôs biggest competition by offering a broader range of vehicles.

Challenges loom large for BYD as Chinese carmakers face pressure on profit margins at home, deal with a subsidy probe in Europe, and remain largely shut out from the U.S., where BYD has long had ambitions to sell passenger EVs. 

Beyond existing U.S. tariffs on Chinese cars, the Inflation Reduction Act will exclude cars made with Chinese components from EV tax credits. For now, the company has been manufacturing and selling buses and trucks in the U.S. Its current strategy is to focus on commercial vehicles in the U.S., a company spokeswoman said. 

**Export ambition**

BYD expects to export 400,000 cars abroad this year, a goal that is achievable, said CMB International analyst Ji Shi. Exports offering higher profit margins are likely to become the next engine of growth for BYD, HSBC analysts wrote in a note earlier this month. 

BYD has yet to make much progress toward its main prize: Europe. BYD is estimated to have sold around 13,000 cars in the European Union last year, far from Tesla‚Äôs 270,000, according to figures compiled by data firm GlobalData. 

In China, BYD held almost 12% of the passenger-car market and Tesla under 3% for the first 11 months of last year, according to figures compiled by GlobalData. Tesla was the market leader in electric vehicles four years ago. While Tesla‚Äôs Model Y remained the most popular electric car in China last year, BYD claimed half of the nation‚Äôs 20 bestselling electric models as it churned out new minivans and sedans.

BYD ‚Äúhas the China market completely covered for the most part,‚Äù said Tu Le, consultant at Sino Auto Insights.

This month, Tesla cut prices in China for some versions of the Model 3 and Model Y, the latest fluctuation over the past year as carmakers engage in a price war in China. Tesla‚Äôs refresh of its Models 3 and Y last year added new features such as ambient interior lighting and a smaller rear screen, features that analysts said were already common among Chinese EVs and might not move the needle for Tesla.  

Tesla didn‚Äôt respond to requests for comment.

While Tesla has fended off past challenges from a range of Chinese automakers, BYD‚Äôs move upmarket presents drivers with more prestigious homegrown choices over foreign rivals.

A price tag of 150,000 yuan, equivalent to around $21,000, used to be the ceiling customers were thought to be prepared to pay for Chinese-branded vehicles, a BYD executive said. Customers flaunted their status with an imported Western vehicle as there were no Chinese-designed cars priced above a million yuan, BYD sales representatives said.

**Delivery ceremonies**

Yangwang luxury vehicles are sold through direct-sales showrooms separate to BYD. Customers picking up their vehicles are offered a delivery ceremony, complete with balloons and floral decorations for special occasions such as a birthday, marriage proposals or anniversaries. 

Buyers of its hybrid U8 SUV have the car key delivered in a gift box, nested with a miniature of the vehicle. BYD videos show the U8 doing a full 360-degree ‚Äútank turn‚Äù on the spot, which has garnered a lot of attention on Chinese social media. 

Jin Songchang, a Chinese businessman, was shopping for an off-road SUV to drive across China‚Äôs vast provinces once he retires. After months of test driving luxury foreign cars, he finally whipped out a deposit for BYD‚Äôs U8, which costs just over $150,000. 

Jin said he was swayed to BYD after company founder Wang Chuanfu said at its launch event that the U8 can run steadily on just three wheels if a tire bursts, thanks to its four powerful in-wheel motors. Jin placed a deposit the next day.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve always appreciated foreign brands more. BYD is the first one I decided to buy on the spot,‚Äù added Jin, who said he owns many cars.

Together with its other two high-end car brands, BYD counted more than 135,500 orders of premium and luxury cars in 2023, according to company data. The U8 SUV will be available in Brazil, the company said last year.  

BYD has yet to open up sales for its supercar, the U9, after it was revealed at the Shanghai Auto Show in April. The sports car can accelerate from 0 to 62 miles in two seconds. This month, Yangwang teased its coming luxury sedan.

BYD is following the footsteps of companies such as General Motors, Ford and Volkswagen with its family of different car brands, analysts say.

Buy a 90$ call and sell a 100$ call.

Granted, Alphabet has more going for it than what the common user interfaces with, but it's that lack of trust on so many levels that has me worried about it being as solid of an investing platform in the future. If a person can't trust it to give unbiased search results, or to allow unbiased discussions or how-to videos (of perfectly legal topics) on its video platform, and if one cannot trust it to cease tracking everything one does - what company or country would be foolish enough to trust its highly sensitive data on Alphabet's servers?

The deal was perceived as crucial for the survival of the companies in a highly competitive market, given the impending merger between Disney's Indian businesses and the media assets of billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries.

Sony cited unmet conditions of the merger agreement as the reason for the termination in a letter sent to Zee early on Monday, Bloomberg News reported earlier on Monday.

The company is expected to disclose the letter to the exchange later, the report added.

Sony declined to comment, while Zee did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for a comment.

[Chart of historical issuance](https://i.imgur.com/4NqB7o0.png)

https://www.ft.com/content/20041cec-a83f-4f41-8cf3-b40d3464c922

US corporate bond markets are ‚Äúon fire‚Äù as companies have sold a record $150bn of debt since the start of this month, the busiest opening to the year for more than three decades.

Investment-grade groups have issued $153bn worth of bonds this month, according to data from London Stock Exchange Group, the highest year-to-date figure for dollar-denominated debt in records going back to 1990.

Borrowers are rushing to lock in lower interest costs, while investors are keen to buy new bonds before policymakers start cutting US interest rates later this year.

‚ÄúThe market is just on fire,‚Äù said Richard Zogheb, head of global debt capital markets at Citi.

Investors ‚Äúwant to lock in longer-term yields now‚Äù, Zogheb said.
Corporate borrowing costs have fallen sharply since financial markets rallied strongly late last year, after the US Federal Reserve signaled that it had completed its campaign of interest rate rises.

Investment-grade yields sit at 5.34 per cent ‚Äî higher than their levels at the end of last year, but well below their mid-November levels of more than 6 per cent.

The ‚Äúspread‚Äù ‚Äî or premium ‚Äî paid by borrowers to issue bonds over the cost of US Treasury yields has shrunk to just 1.01 percentage points, according to Ice BofA index data. This is the lowest level in two years.

The first month of the year is typically busy for new issuance, but bankers and strategists said this month‚Äôs particularly strong burst of activity reflected companies rushing to take advantage of that fall in yields.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a lot cheaper for [issuers] to borrow now than it was just a few months ago,‚Äù said Matt Brill, senior portfolio manager at Invesco Fixed Income. ‚ÄúSo in that regard, they‚Äôre thinking ‚Äòhey, this is a good time to go ahead and do it‚Äô.‚Äù

More than two-thirds of this month‚Äôs borrowing has been by banks and other companies classified as financials by LSEG.
Zogheb pointed to concerns that banks‚Äô regulatory capital requirements could increase. But, he said, ‚Äúthe biggest factor‚Äù driving issuance was ‚Äújust pent-up need to issue paper‚Äù. Many companies postponed debt-raising plans last year after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.

Banks that have issued bonds since the start of 2024 include JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley, raising $8.5bn, $8bn and $6.75bn respectively.

Non-financial companies tapping lenders include energy group Energy Transfer with a $3bn deal, natural gas producer EQT with a $750mn deal, telecoms company T-Mobile with a $3bn transaction and Canada‚Äôs Liberty Utilities with an $850mn offering.

Borrowers may be trying to get ahead of any economic data that could threaten the positive mood, some of those involved in the market said.

‚ÄúEverybody‚Äôs bought into the ‚Äòsoft landing‚Äô narrative at this point,‚Äù said Maureen O‚ÄôConnor, global head of Wells Fargo‚Äôs high-grade debt syndicate. ‚ÄúIt just feels priced for perfection . . . And so I think there are some nerves that there are near-term catalysts for volatility.‚Äù

Many finance directors believe it is better to issue debt now rather than risk waiting for further falls in case the market turns.
‚ÄúNo treasurer is going to get fired because he left 10 or 15 basis points on the table,‚Äù said one senior banker. ‚ÄúSome treasurer is going to get fired for not financing and then seeing the market shut down for a couple of months.‚Äù",2024-01-22,0

   *\*****Streaming****: at $90 it seems like the street is valuing streaming at 0 even though it's 2/3s the size of Netflix and it matches Netflix's revenue just before the pandemic. It showed a healthy growth of 12% shrinking losses by a billion. Pushed by ad revenue, Ampere analytics now predicts profitability as early as Q1 2024. More upside comes from Charter which just added millions of subs to their ad-tier Jan-5 and the India merger where all Jio Cinema subs will be offered Disney+ exclusively in India for 5 years.*

   *\*****Experiences****: their cruises reported a 98% occupancy last quarter; Disney is doubling its capacity in the next two years. Park expansions in Hong Kong & Shanghai are already clocking record attendance. Tokyo's expansion is next summer followed by Paris. In Florida, Disney World surged again this holiday clocking its busiest day since reopening on December 29. Disney started selling Magic Keys ""annual passes"" again a few weeks ago and they were all sold out in hours.*

*\*****Content****: ""it can't get worse"" should suffice, but Disney's upcoming slate is better than that. The best tracking for box office projections is done through pre-sales. If presales aren't open yet, we track it with surveys like* [*Quorum.com*](https://Quorum.com)*. Deadpool3, InsideOut2 & Planet of the Apes are tracking on top of their categories very far from release. Deadpool3, Marvel's next film, is impossible to open <120mil with its rare scores. On streaming as well, it boasts a strong slate; they just announced that Percy Jackson (currently running) clocked 26mil views; that's House of the Dragon-level numbers. Disney should dominate 2023 Nielsen's top streamed films list released in the next two weeks.* 

*Plus the argument that bad content will translate to worse park attendance is a falsehood; Disney's content had a terrible decade in the 2000's but the parks flourished. It doesn't make sense that parents and kids stop going to their parks cause an original animated film that year flopped. That may have an effect in a decade, but not short-term.*

*\*****India Merger****: it's looking more and more certain. It will be a merger of equals with equal representation in the board. Regulatory concerns are allayed by the fact that it's a deal with Mukesh Ambani who's well connected and is a close friend of the prime minister, he's know to get things quickly.*

*\*****ESPN****: is back on a growth curve last quarter in all metrics. If the NFL deal goes through, it's a game changer; Peacock's streaming number for the latest play-off proves that and Disney is best poised for the deal with ESPN/Disney having massive footing in both linear and streamer.* 

  *\*****Technicals****: chart looks to have struck a bottom and it recorded a golden cross.* 

&#x200B;

*Of course,* ***linear networks*** *declining is a major overhang; but it's a secular decline pressuring all media companies. It's to be countered by streaming where Disney is positioned best among all legacy media companies.*

1437,(Bloomberg) Apple Vision Pro deliveries are delayed to March,263,19c5iic,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/19c5iic/bloomberg_apple_vision_pro_deliveries_are_delayed/,137,"""*Apple Inc. began taking preorders for its long-awaited Vision Pro mixed-reality headset on Friday, and early indications suggest that buyers are snapping up initial supplies of the $3,499 device.*   
  
*The product went on sale at 8 a.m. Eastern time on Apple‚Äôs website and mobile app, ahead of its rollout on Feb. 2. Delivery dates for all three models quickly slipped to March 8-15 for online orders, and the device was sold out for in-store pickup on day one at many locations. The delay signals that either demand is strong or supplies are limited ‚Äî or something in between.*

*Apple shares gained as much as 1.8% to $191.95 Friday in New York, erasing most of its 2% decline for January.*   
  
*With the launch, the company disclosed two additional configurations: a version with 512 gigabytes of storage for $3,699, and a top-end model with 1 terabyte of space for $3,899. The base model includes 256 gigabytes of storage. The company also said it would sell a carrying case for $199 and additional batteries for $199, while extra bands will cost $99 a piece.*   
  
*The purchasing process for the Vision Pro is unique. Customers need to use a recent iPhone or iPad to scan their head and, if necessary, provide a vision prescription. Apple typically doesn‚Äôt comment on the sales performance of new products.*  
*Wall Street analysts are predicting a slow start for the device. UBS Group AG analyst David Vogt expects Apple to ship 300,000 to 400,000 units this year, generating as much as $1.4 billion. For a company that had sales of $383 billion last year, that‚Äôs ‚Äúimmaterial.‚Äù*

*Still, the idea is to set the stage for something bigger. Apple is entering its first major new product category since the company began selling smartwatches in 2015, and the Vision Pro may take years to catch on. Apple will continue to refine the headset ‚Äî making it cheaper and more comfortable ‚Äî and find compelling applications for the device.*  
  
*In the longer run, Apple could use a fresh moneymaker. The smartphone market has matured, and it‚Äôs under particular pressure in China. The company‚Äôs revenue has fallen for four straight quarters ‚Äî its longest streak of declines in more than two decades.*

*Initially, the Cupertino, California-based company only plans to sell the Vision Pro in the US, with launches in other markets coming in the months ahead. The company is eyeing the UK, Canada and China as some of the first other countries, Bloomberg News has reported.*  
  
*It‚Äôs a complex product to manufacture, which could limit early supplies. The dual 4K resolution displays in the headset, which melds virtual and augmented reality, have suffered production snags. But the fact that Apple has been ramping up manufacturing for months suggests that it will be able to satisfy initial demand. The company is also offering a 25% discount on the device for employees, signaling that supplies aren‚Äôt too tight.*

*Inside Apple, executives are anticipating a strong opening weekend, with sales tapering off later. At $3,499, the Vision Pro is one of the priciest consumer headsets ever ‚Äî about seven times more expensive than the latest device from VR market leader Meta Platforms Inc.*  
  
*The Vision Pro also will be a hard product to share with family and friends. It requires a precise fitting process to ensure a good experience. The face scan is designed to determine the best light seal and strap size for users. The company has prepared 25 different light seals ‚Äî a cushion that prevents light from seeping into the wearer‚Äôs field of view ‚Äî in addition to two straps. There also are prescription lens inserts, at an additional cost.*   
  
*And the headset may be hard for some people to wear for extended periods. In early testing, some users have found it to be too heavy.*  
  
*Another concern that‚Äôs cropped up in recent days is a lack of support from top streaming apps. Netflix Inc., Spotify Technology SA and Google‚Äôs YouTube are opting not to release software for the device, at least at launch.*  
  
*But Apple has carefully refined its sales pitch for the headset. When consumers try it out at Apple retail stores, they‚Äôll get a 25-minute demo, letting them get comfortable with the 3D experience that the company calls ‚Äúspatial computing.‚Äù*  
  
*To commemorate the launch, Apple executives Mike Rockwell and Alan Dye discussed the device in a Q&A shared with employees this week.*  
  
*A key focus, said Dye, was ensuring that the Vision Pro didn‚Äôt have a closed-in feel ‚Äî a complaint with VR headsets.*  
  
*‚ÄúFrom the onset, we all had concerns about people sitting with their eyes covered and disconnected from the world,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt really became central to how we thought about the core principles of the product.‚Äù*  
  
*That led to the EyeSight system, which can show a wearer‚Äôs eyes through a screen on the front of the Vision Pro. ‚ÄúIt was a huge technical challenge to do this in a way that looks and feels natural,‚Äù Rockwell said.*  
  
*Apple also developed an interface that doesn‚Äôt require handheld accessories. Instead, it tracks eye movement and hand gestures. Users control the device by looking at an on-screen item and pinching their fingers together to select it.*  
  
*One of the biggest selling points may be how easy it makes collaboration, Rockwell said. Users in far-flung locations can feel like they‚Äôre in the same place.*  
  
*‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the closest thing to being there in person that you can possibly have,‚Äù Rockwell said. ‚ÄúIt changes the way you collaborate and is very different from videoconferencing as we know it.‚Äù*

1438,Locking in Profits,38,19c47a3,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/19c47a3/locking_in_profits/,66,"Bit of a long post tl:dr at bottom

I‚Äôll start by saying if you continue to dca into index funds passively per the Bogleheads strategy over the course of 20 years you will be in the money, time in the market beats timing the market. 

We have broken ATH and are at peak euphoria, everyone is piling in, all the articles in major media is bullish, reddit is bullish. This is the time to be contrarian and be cautious, and perhaps consider locking in profits.

Most investors who have been trading have never experienced a prolonged bear market barring the quick covid crash. In the 70s and post 01 crash the market didnt make new ath for a decade. Again if you can continue to dca during this time you will come out ahead. But MANY people dont have the mental fortitude to buy when there is blood in the streets and end up selling the troughs. 

The yield curves inversion is ending, this has historically signaled  recession every time without fail, this time could be different. History doesnt repeat but it does rhyme. The composite manufacturing index hasnt been this negative since GFC. Credit card balances are highest its ever been. 

Last year at start of 23 everyone was calling for recession and crash, we got a big rally. Now the narrative is soft landing and election year boom, when the trade gets crowded thats when danger arises.

There is still juice left to be squeezed out of the market, but the risk to reward is not good here. Consider locking in some profits. No one ever got poor from taking profit. In a MMF you can get close to 5 percent, guaranteed. You always have to consider the equity risk premium, how much downside are you risking for the possible extra return in the stock market?

1439,As a whole this sub is overly negative on taking profits and building a cash position,107,19c1cbn,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/19c1cbn/as_a_whole_this_sub_is_overly_negative_on_taking/,170,"I see a lot of people asking about taking profits during ATHs. And the overwhelming response is without a further thought to talk about the markets often being at ATHs and gambling by timing the market and long charts of the S&P.

I thought it was worth a discussion post to point out that theres much more nuance to it than that. 

For starters not all investors are the same. Some invest using only tax advantages retirement accounts. Some invest using only taxable brokerages. Some invest using both. This is already a fundamental question to determine when someone starts talking about taking profits and building a cash position. 

For taxable brokerages there can be many reasons to lock in profits and sell at ATHs. So the next question really should be about that investors goals and larger financial situation. Do they have losses to offset? Are they using their profits to address another, perhaps more pressing financial need/goal? What percentage of their portfolio are they considering selling and using for a cash position? 

It is also much different selling index funds or ETFs vs single positions. Selling your VOO because it‚Äôs at an ATH is much different than selling a single company position that you have made a 200% return on thus far.

So in summary before giving advice or mocking posters for their questions remember it‚Äôs always important to ask and understand their situation, their intentions and goals and the specifics of what they are actually proposing",2024-01-21,0

Wondering what peoples‚Äô opinions are on drone technology companies. I know nothing of this industry and only dedicate around 20% of my portfolio to individual stocks. 

But I have become intrigued by the possibility of innumerable applications of drone technology in the future. This first became extremely evident with all the [horrifying and disgusting] footage of the carnage due to offensive drone-dropped ordinance in Ukraine currently. But then I came across a video of drones being used to drop supplies for aid as well as search and rescue. And now I realize the far bigger use case in logistics. I have around a 30 year horizon still and am just curious if anyone has any companies that develop or produce drone tech with plans for large scale applications.

Anyone have any companies/tickers to look into? Mostly just interested in building a small position to grow over time and hopefully capture some outsized returns way down the road when drones may be an absolutely invaluable part of daily human life. Of course this may be lofty but nonetheless I enjoy considering investment ideas that pique my specific interests and keep me engaged (as opposed to my personal standard of 80% boring total market index etfs).

1443,Uber/Lyft doomed with autonomous vehicles?,0,19biirs,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/19biirs/uberlyft_doomed_with_autonomous_vehicles/,55,"I commonly hear of story suggesting that Uber/Lyft would be doomed once fully autonomous cars become mainstream. The reasoning being, Tesla for example, can start their own ride sharing service, putting their own inventory at work.

While there is a good chance of this happening, I do not agree with it. My argument is, it is not scalable to do for a car manufacturer. 

Uber and Lyft have an edge because of its nature of business. They continue to be a gig worker company where people who own autonomous cars put their car at work, just like today, but without a driver. So cars work for owners and Uber simply takes a cut.

1444,How do people manage to wipe out their accounts? Or am I just being delusional,0,19bhell,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/19bhell/how_do_people_manage_to_wipe_out_their_accounts/,103,"I‚Äôm sorry but I just don‚Äôt see it. I just don‚Äôt see how you can be that dumb. Like I wanna know for my self if people are just dumb or if I‚Äôm being delusional. I‚Äôm not trying to be mean but come on. I‚Äôm a VERY emotional person. I got scammed 5k and nearly lost my mind. People are scared to trade because of the stupidity they hear about trading and how it‚Äôs so hard and they lost all this money in not even in 5 years, in ONE year. How can you be that dumb ? Like fine your 40k is now 10kafter 4 years of experience, but how the HELL did you manage to do that in 1 year?


But seriously, what causes that? The way I‚Äôm thinking, is 

1. Pick decent stocks, not risky penny stocks or stupid shit like that

2. Take decent profits and don‚Äôt push it (unless you are investing longer than a year in a reputable company)

3. Diversify your portfolio

4. Trade based on your capital (if your capital is $10k, don‚Äôt put fucking $6k in one stock you barely have any room for the 2% limit if it goes down)

5. Know when to actually sell a stock so if you can risk 200 on a trade, don‚Äôt just suddenly freak out and sell all your stocks when they are all $100 down. Maybe the market is down

6. Play around and risk very little at first to get used to the market

7. Get something some kind of software that analyzes stocks and recommends stocks

8. Fucking control your emotions. Which is why you trade with very little at first. You won‚Äôt freak out being $5 down but you will when you‚Äôre $500. 

9. Don‚Äôt ever be an idiot and gamble. If you‚Äôre gambling with stocks, then accept the fact that you‚Äôre gambling, not trading so you won‚Äôt be mad when you lose all your money

10. Stop thinking you can turn this into a full time job in a couple weeks. Start with small profits as a side hustle

Yeah there‚Äôs technical analysis and all, which you should learn as you trade. But realistically, if you just shut the fuck to for a couple minutes and thought realistically, you‚Äôd be fine. SO many stocks can make you money. But you choose to be risky and emotional. Don‚Äôt just sell right away at any loss. But also, accept when you just have to take a loss instead of holding on to hope and risking more. And don‚Äôt risk and gamble. And take profits, even small ones. Stop expecting to double you‚Äôre $1000 and start taking 5% $50 profits because with the little knowledge you have, you‚Äôll get excited, and be scared to sell, then it‚Äôll crash and you‚Äôll lose your money. Now imagine if you just sold at 5% and made your $50 on every trade!

Successful people focus on minimizing losses, not chasing gains at least at first. 

Also I‚Äôm an idiot who‚Äôs still learning. Right when I start feeling cocky, I humble myself because it‚Äôs embarrassing to be all cocky then lose a ton of money the next day. I guess I made this post for my self. To give my self hope. Im sick of hearing how trading is soooooo hard when in reality people freak out and turn their 50k to 5k In a year. Now if you minimized your losses, maybe you would‚Äôve lost 5k and learned something.

Oh and don‚Äôt day trade thinking you can become a day trader and make $100 a day in a couple weeks . THAT is hard. Maybe, be more realistic with the stock market? Idk who am I though I‚Äôm not smart just my opinion",2024-01-20,0

My understanding is that when I buy index funds, the brokerage firm (Fidelity, in my case) is buying the stocks that make up that fund. So when a new company enters the S&P 500, wouldn't Fidelity have to buy new stock in that company to match the investments of all of their customers who hold S&P 500 funds? And wouldn't that lead to an enormous surge in demand for a company's stock when they enter the top 500, and similarly a huge sell-off for a company if they drop out of the top 500?

The S&P 500 rose 1.23% to settle at 4,839.81, surpassing both the prior record intraday and closing highs. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which set its own record at the end of last year, added 395.19 points, or 1.05%. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.7%. The smaller, more tech-focused Nasdaq-100 gained 1.8% to also hit a record high.

All three major averages are now in positive territory for 2024, with the 30-stock Dow going green during Friday's rally.

Following a 19% loss in 2022, the S&P 500 roared back in 2023, posting a 24% gain as the economy skirted a recession that many had expected and inflation came down to levels that allowed the Federal Reserve to pause its interest rate hikes. The benchmark came close to reaching a record following a forceful fourth-quarter rally, but ultimately fell short. The market rally paused a bit to start 2024 as investors took some profits in the Big Tech leaders like Apple.

But they returned to buying those tech leaders in recent days. Friday's milestone confirms that the stock market is officially in a bull market that began in October 2022, and not just a bounce within a bear market. The S&P 500 is up more than 35% since that low.

""In the mind of the investor, [companies] leading in AI or having a product set that's differentiated in the tech space are very, very strongly leading the market. That's been a wave that's persisted throughout the remainder of last year and into 2024,"" said Matt Stucky, chief portfolio manager at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management.

The tech sector gained 2.1% on Friday and jumped more than 4% during the trading week, making it the S&P 500's best-performing sector week to date.

Whether the broader market index can maintain its growth momentum in 2024 ""is going to be a question of whether the Fed is able to stick a soft landing or not,"" Stucky said. He noted that the driver of the S&P 500's growth in 2023 was tied to multiples, rather than earnings.

""Multiples rise coming out of economic slowdowns, because investors are pricing in a recovery. If that recovery doesn't materialize, then you do have to question the sustainability of not only holding on to new highs, but making new highs beyond that,"" Stucky added.

Fresh consumer data on Friday indicated that consumers are becoming more confident on the economy and inflation. The University of Michigan's Survey of Consumers showed a 21.4% year-over-year jump to reach its highest level since July 2021.

Insurance company Travelers rose more than 5% after posting an earnings beat. Schlumberger gained nearly 2% after beating on top and bottom lines, and Ally Financial surged over 10% after reporting strong quarterly results and a sale of a business unit to Synchrony Financial.

Host, Melissa Lee: ""Welcome back to Fast Money. We're diving into Citizens Financial Group's latest earnings. Dan, kick us off.""  
  
Dan Nathan: ""Alright, Melissa. CFG's Q4 2023 revenues have taken a hit, down to $2.00 billion from $2.20 billion last year. Net income also declined. They've been struggling with the consensus EPS estimates over the past four quarters ‚Äì a trend that's concerning.""  
  
Guy Adami: ""Dan's right, but let's look at the bright spots. Their private bank initiative netted $1.2 billion in deposits since its launch. This move could be a game-changer for CFG in the competitive banking landscape.""  
  
Karen Finerman: ""Agreed, Guy. But on expenses ‚Äì they've done a solid job. Despite new investments, there was a slight decrease in Q4 2023. It's a tightrope walk with the FDIC special assessment in play.""  
  
Tim Seymour: ""The tone in the earnings call struck me. Cautiously optimistic, yet aware of the challenges, especially in mortgage banking. They're focusing on growth areas, which is crucial in this economic climate.""  
  
Brian Kelly: ""Speaking of climate, we've seen their stock take a bit of a dip recently. It's crucial to watch how CFG navigates the Fed's policies and broader economic trends. The market's reaction in the coming months will be telling.""  
  
Steve Grasso: ""And let's not ignore the dividend ‚Äì $0.42 announced for early 2024. Pausing share buybacks in Q4 2023 but planning to resume is a significant move for investors looking at CFG.""

While the ATH could still be high for many of these, the screener seem to have picked up some good winners.

Now, it's true that most stocks rebounded from their covid (march 2020) lows, this was added in **Jan** **2021**, when SPY already had made new ATH after covid lows. and these screener stocks appear to have survived the last year's crash.

https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/19/consumer-sentiment-surges-while-inflation-outlook-dips-university-of-michigan-survey-shows.html

Consumers have grown more confident about the direction of the economy and inflation at onset of 2024, despite persistent worries about a looming slowdown, a survey released Friday showed.

The University of Michigan‚Äôs Consumer Survey of Consumers showed a reading of 78.8 for January, its highest level since July 2021 and up 21.4% from a year ago. That followed a big jump in December and comes despite public opinion surveys showing concern about the nation‚Äôs direction.

On a two-month basis, sentiment showed its largest increase since 1991, said Joanne Hsu, the survey‚Äôs director.

‚ÄúConsumer views were supported by confidence that inflation has turned a corner and strengthening income expectations,‚Äù Hsu said. ‚ÄúDemocrats and Republicans alike showed their most favorable readings since summer of 2021. Sentiment has now risen nearly 60% above the all-time low measured in June of 2022 and is likely to provide some positive momentum for the economy.‚Äù

Along with the improved outlook on general conditions, survey respondents displayed more confidence that inflation is coming down.

The outlook for the inflation rate a year from now declined to 2.9%, down from 3.1% in December for the lowest reading since December 2020. The Federal Reserve has boosted short-term interest rates to their highest level in more than 22 years and inflation has followed suit lower, though it remains above the central bank‚Äôs 2% target.

At the same time, the survey‚Äôs index of current conditions also leaped higher, rising to 83.3, or 21.6% higher than a year ago.

Consumer sentiment has improved amid a drop in gasoline prices and solid stock market gains. The price at the pump for a gallon of regular gas is about 30 cents lower than it was a year ago, according to AAA, and the S&P 500 is near a record high.

The survey is ‚Äúanother sign that the economy is on track for a soft landing,‚Äù said Andrew Hunter, deputy chief economist at Capital Economics. However, he noted that such surveys don‚Äôt always feed through to consumer behavior.

Stocks rose slightly following the release while Treasury yields also were higher.

Market have been tethered to expectations for where the Fed will take interest rates this year. The prevailing outlook is for a series of up to six quarter percentage point cuts this year. But the timing of those cuts is unclear, with market pricing now pointing to a tossup as to whether the Fed eases in March or waits until May.",2024-01-19,0

I got into IRBT because it seemed that if Microsoft was allowed to acquire Activision, AMZN should be able to acquire a vacuume company, no issue, right? Right? 

It seemed like the risk to reward was there but I think the moral of the story is: don‚Äôt buy garbage companies and expect them to fly up. I have played various other merger plays with good success but this one went against my idea of buying decent companies. **Without the merger, IRBT is still overvalued at current prices.**

If you are still in this, the risks of blockage are higher than I expected because AMZN isn‚Äôt willing to play ball. Also, considering AMZN dropped the acquisition price previously, it is possible they will drop it again due to the massive drop in price recently. Good luck to anyone who is still playing this. 

All and all, lost a good chunk of money, sold, and I‚Äôve learned my lesson: **if you aren‚Äôt willing to hold the underlying, don‚Äôt buy it just solely for the merger.**",2024-01-19,0

Global core inflation picked up to an estimated one-month annualized rate of 2.6% in December, from the rock-bottom 1.2% reading in November (averaged across early hikers in emerging markets and the G10, excluding Japan).

However, Goldman Sachs Research still thinks inflation is improving. The three-month annualized rate fell further to an estimated 2% in December. The adjustment in core goods prices is far from complete ‚Äî for example, US used cars have only unwound 31% of their Covid-related price increase. And our economists expect both service inflation and wage growth to continue slowing gradually in a lagged response to the improved supply / demand balance across the global economy.

The US has been a key part of the global decline in inflation, and the country's labor market is continuing to rebalance. Goldman Sachs Research therefore expects the Federal Reserve to start cutting rates soon, most likely in March. Our economists are forecasting five cuts this year, which is below the six to seven cuts reflected in financial markets. By comparison, only 9% of clients expect the first rate cut in the first quarter of this year, according to a poll this week at Goldman Sachs's Global Strategy Conference in London.",2024-01-19,0

1466,Starbucks(SBUX) DCF Analysis,20,19aj7es,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/19aj7es/starbuckssbux_dcf_analysis/,16,"# Introduction:

SBUX has been gaining traction lately as a premium coffee experience from the United States. As the world gets richer, coffee consumption also grows ([SOURCE](https://www.dovepress.com/coffee-consumption-behavior-in-young-adults-exploring-motivations-freq-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-PRBM)). SBUX's expansive menu with constantly updated seasonal items creating a brand-new experience for customers, this novel experience hooks customers' curiosity and their wallets.  SBUX could even operate as a quasi-bank with their rewards app and prepaid cards that allow SBUX to essentially invest this cash without the traditional risk of a bank i.e. not having enough cash on hand when customers want to withdraw their cash in large droves. SBUX is even seen as a luxury item in China, allowing SBUX to charge a premium and succeed over their closest competitor.

# Revenue:

Overall, for revenue, I took into account how SBUX has to maintain its luxury good status and keep its prices elevated. This leaves SBUX room to expand mainly into wealthier countries. Management has stated that China has the largest potential, with China coming in second for the number of SBUX outlets opened ([SOURCE](https://www.statista.com/statistics/306915/countries-with-the-largest-number-of-starbucks-stores-worldwide/)).

When forecasting the number of stores open, as SBUX is seen as a luxury good this may limit its expansion into the different tier cities of China or to any less wealthy country. SBUX doesn‚Äôt compete on price but rather on the experience of coffee, so their strategy to grow revenue is unlikely to include price cutting.

\[[INSERT](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1302245/china-breakdown-of-starbucks-stores-by-city-tier/)\]

As evidence of this, 86% of the stores SBUX operates in are in Tier 1 & 2 Cities in China. SBUX is only opening stores in prosperous cities in line with its brand image of being a premium brand. 

I assumed that in the earlier years of my forecast, the main growth came from SBUX expanding its footprints in wealthier countries. Thereafter, SBUX‚Äôs main growth driver comes from developing countries. Looking at the top 25 fastest developing countries GDP growth rate as of 2023 ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/25-fastest-growing-economies-world-140701215.html)). The Median is 6.20%, Average is 10.47%.   
  
When forecasting Revenue/Company Operated Stores, I assume that SBUX‚Äôs ability to generate revenue was in line with the macroenvironment. I assume that the macroenvironment takes 3 years to restart growth. As the macro conditions lighten up, SBUX begins having a larger ticket and transaction volume.  
  
When forecasting the Number of Licensed stores, I took into account the %of total stores that are owned directly by SBUX. This ratio remained consistent from FY19 to FY23 and this ratio is important as SBUX wants to maintain >50% control as a way of ensuring quality control globally through directly owning and operating the majority of operations of SBUX around the globe. The %begins tapering downwards over time as a better macro environment will encourage SBUX to pursue more aggressive growth plans through franchising.  
  
When forecasting Revenue/Licensed Stores, I assumed Y/Y growth as an average %of the historic rate before it begins to half as SBUX in recent years experienced large Y/Y growth from closing less profitable stores globally, and over time SBUX would figure out how best to monetize their licensed stores.

# Cost:

When forecasting COGS and others, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a %revenue based on historic averages.  
  
When forecasting store operating expenses, when SBUX increased its store count I assumed that there was some inefficiency that would get resolved over time, and on top of that as SBUX gets more efficient and franchise takes up a larger %of total store count, store operating expense which is a fixed cost begins declining.   
  
When forecasting G&A, SBUX tailors each store to cater to SBUX‚Äôs premium image. This image requires humans to upkeep, requiring human baristas to give the image of handcrafted coffee rather than a mechanized coffee machine that can be easily replicated and mass-produced. As evidence, when SBUX tried rolling out coffee machines to their stores it led to a decline in revenue as the SBUX experience was worsened. So, I assumed that G&A remains a %of historic averages for SBUX to maintain its minimum headcount for each store.

# CapEX and D&A:

When forecasting D&A, opting for less granularity I forecasted D&A as a %of historic averages.  
  
When forecasting CapEX, I accounted for how much %earnings SBUX had historically reinvested and their %ROIC. ([SOURCE](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/ROIC/SBUX/ROIC-Percentage/SBUX)) Assuming that SBUX has a higher ROIC over time due to its improving brand premium and more profitable franchise arm.

# WACC:

RFR = 4.03%  
US ERP = 4.60%  
Beta ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SBUX/)) = 0.98

%Debt = 27.35%  
%Equity = 72.65%  
WACC = 7.38%

# Conclusion:

In my base case, I value SBUX at $87.09 per share. I believe that SBUX is more or less correctly priced with some momentum carried over from them beating their earnings previous quarter. I believe that SBUX is a strong brand name. However, for consumables like coffee, the ability to reinvest back into R&D and differentiate themselves from competitors is rather limited. With factors such as taste and aesthetics being highly subjective to the consumer or even being similar to their competitors. SBUX's management recognises their limited ability to reinvest and create results, so instead of destroying value by forcing reinvestments, they have decided to pay it out as dividends instead. This limited ability to reinvest has led to SBUX being properly priced by the market.

Amazon‚Äôs cloud ambitions are going global.

Amazon Web Services said Friday it will invest 2.3 trillion yen ($15 billion) in Japan by 2027 to expand its cloud infrastructure in Tokyo and Osaka to meet growing demand.

Japan has lagged behind in its generative artificial intelligence development but the government, and its tech companies, are battling to catch up.

Amazon is happy to help, and in the process expand its global footprint.

In May last year, the tech giant‚Äôs cloud unit pledged to invest $12.7 billion in India by 2030, again to meet growing demand for cloud services. That long-term commitment will take AWS‚Äôs total investment in India to $16.4 billion after it funded the launch of two data infrastructure regions in Mumbai and Hyderabad between 2016 and 2022.

Its Japanese endeavors have followed a similar blueprint, launching in Tokyo and 2011 and Osaka in 2021 before embarking on a major expansion in the years ahead.

Amazon previously said its 1.51 trillion yen cloud investment in Japan between 2011 and 2022 contributed 1.31 trillion yen in gross domestic product to the Japanese economy.

AWS‚Äô cloud operations are now present in 12 regions in Asia Pacific and China‚ÄîHong Kong, Melbourne, Mumbai, Seoul, Sydney, Tokyo, Osaka, Beijing, Ningxia, Jakarta and Hyderabad, according to the company‚Äôs website.",2024-01-19,0

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman is a great book that explains how our brains trick us into making bad money decisions.  


Loss aversion is a key concept discussed in the book.  


Loss aversion helps explain why we hold onto losing investments way longer than we should.  


We feel the pain of losses more than the pleasure of gains, so we might make irrational decisions to avoid losses.  


Losing $100 feels twice as bad as gaining $100. And because the pain of losing something is stronger than the pleasure of gaining the same thing, this can lead to irrational decision-making.  


The book also discusses the concept of attitude to risk, which is influenced by loss aversion.   


We tend to be risk-averse when it comes to gains, but risk-seeking when it comes to losses.   


This can lead to our holding onto losing stocks in the hope that they will bounce back, rather than selling them and realizing a loss.  


I recommend this book to anyone looking to level up their mindset and psychology around investing.  


Key lesson: Never let your emotions dictate your money decisions.

Do you think it's important to understand the psychological factors that influence our decision-making processes?",2024-01-19,0

Is now a good time to be bullish on lithium stocks while they‚Äôre cheap?,218,19a7tit,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/19a7tit/we_are_5y_to_10y_away_from_global_ev_adoption/,411,"There‚Äôs no denying that we‚Äôre not too far away from a policy driven EV adoption wave of massive proportions. All the top global car markets are very much aligned on this:

**China - Biggest car market:** The Chinese government has implemented a quota system to limit the number of gasoline-powered cars sold in the country.

**US - Second biggest car market:** This rollout will likely happen state by state (California‚Äôs EV mandate is leading the pack). On a federal level, Biden's EPA wants to enact a mandate that will push for two-thirds of all new vehicles to be electric by 2032.

**EU - Third biggest car market:**¬†The EU has the strictest EV adoption goals with all new cars and vans registered set to be zero emission by 2035.

Japan, Indian, Canada, UK, and 80 more countries are also implementing aggressive EV adoption mandates all set on meeting a 2030 - 2035 deadline.

Like many things macro, the global adoption curve will be initially incremental with a very sharp turn appearing outta nowhere around the halfway point. I‚Äôm betting that it will take place around 2027 - 2030. A few things that strengthen this hypothesis:¬†

1. ¬†Global relations and supply chain deterioration as a result of regional conflict, brics, etc.
2. ¬†Countries are finally investing on sovereign energy assets to mitigate 3rd party risk (Russia, Saudi, etc).
3. Institutional, public and private capital incentives (grants for charging infrastructure, tax perks, etc).

Does that mean that I‚Äôm going Yolo on EV automakers? No, not for a while at least - they have a tough hill to climb (R&D costs, retail saturation, infra costs, the list goes on).

On Instagram Thursday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company will have 350,000 Nvidia H100 graphics processing units and overall almost 600,000 H100 compute equivalent GPUs by the end of this year.

‚ÄúOur long term vision is to build general intelligence, open source it responsibly, and make it widely available so everyone can benefit,‚Äù he wrote in the post. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre building massive compute infrastructure to support our future roadmap‚Äù for artificial intelligence. Zuckerberg also said he excited about Meta‚Äôs progress incorporating AI technology in other type of devices like its Ray Ban smart glasses.

Start-ups and enterprise have clamored for Nvidia ‚Äôs GPUs, or graphics processing units because they are well suited for the parallel computations needed for AI projects.

A Meta spokesperson declined to provide clarity on the timing of H100 purchases and on whether the other H100 equivalent GPUs consisted of other Nvidia GPU models or were from different third parties.

Nvidia declined to comment on the timing of Meta‚Äôs H100 purchases.

The H100 is Nvidia‚Äôs current top-of-line data center GPU and costs roughly $25,000 per GPU, according to a slide in an earlier company presentation that showed a 16 H100 GPU system costs $400,000.

Though, it is unknown at what price Meta can purchase the H100, a quantity of 350,000 at $25,000 per GPU comes to nearly $9 billion.

* The total on hand for exchange-traded funds and notes, along with passively managed mutual funds, totaled $13.29 trillion at the end of December, nudging higher than the $13.23 trillion held in actively managed funds, according to Morningstar.
* That movement in money accompanied a rough year for stock pickers. Just 38% of large-cap active funds outperformed their Russell index benchmarks.


Passive investment products have long been pulling in the lion‚Äôs share of money from investors, but as 2023 came to a close they achieved a milestone: holding more assets than their actively managed counterparts.

The total assets under management in exchange-traded funds and notes along with passively managed mutual funds reached a combined $13.29 trillion at the end of December, nudging above the $13.23 trillion held in active assets, according to Morningstar.

While passively managed stock funds long ago took the lead, this was the first time that passively managed products surpassed active across all asset classes combined.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a long time coming,‚Äù said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research and one of Wall Street‚Äôs closest trackers of the ETF industry since it first started drawing investor attention. ‚ÄúLast year with equities it was a very difficult year for active outperformance. ... It was a year when you had an initial burst of enthusiasm for a few months, then a pullback and then a rush at the end. Kind of a nightmare scenario for an active manager.‚Äù

Indeed, just in large-cap blended funds alone, passive funds raked in a net $192.8 billion for the year while active funds lost $48.6 billion, Morningstar reported. Large-cap growth funds saw a net $38.3 billion move to passive funds while active lost $91.2 billion.

That movement in money accompanied a rough year for stock pickers. Just 38% of large-cap active funds outperformed their Russell index benchmarks, down from 47% in 2022 although around the long-term average, according to Bank of America.

In contrast, passive funds, which primarily track market indexes such as the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite, had a strong year thanks to a big performance from the broader market. The S&P 500 alone had a 24% return for the year.

‚ÄúYou had to be right there when the liftoff happened going into November and December,‚Äù Colas said. ‚ÄúIn many ways, it was the hardest possible environment for active managers to keep their cool, stay focused and not get overly optimistic or pessimistic.‚Äù

Adding to the challenges was the performance of the ‚ÄúMagnificent 7‚Äù tech-centric stocks ‚Äî Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla, Nvidia, Meta and Amazon

‚Äî which carried most of the weight for the market. The Nasdaq 100, which is weighted toward technology, exploded 55% higher last year on a total return basis.

‚ÄúYou had this remarkable market leadership in Big Tech and some managers can‚Äôt own it because of mandates or a reluctance to have 25%-plus of their portfolio in a handful of names,‚Äù Colas said.

Still, there could be hope ahead for active management if market conditions change in 2024.

‚ÄúAs far as what a stock-pickers market looks like, it‚Äôs basically a low-volatility, low-correlation market without a lot of drawdowns that instill fear into money managers and force them to sell at the bottom,‚Äù Colas said. ‚ÄúThis could be that kind of year.‚Äù",2024-01-18,0

1480,WSJ - The $8.8 Trillion Cash Pile That Has Stock-Market Bulls Salivating,116,199ttbu,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/199ttbu/wsj_the_88_trillion_cash_pile_that_has/,74,"https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/the-8-8-trillion-cash-pile-that-has-stock-market-bulls-salivating-0a1b4a8c

Wall Street wants your money off the sidelines.

Rising interest rates drew trillions of dollars into money-market funds and other cash-like investments in the past two years, with more than $8.8 trillion parked in money funds and CDs as of the third quarter of 2023. Investors are optimistic that with rates poised to fall, people will redirect that money and fuel markets‚Äô next leg higher.

Vivek Trivedi, 37 years old, a pharmacist in Indianapolis, has around $80,000, or a bit more than 10% of his overall assets, in money-market funds and inflation-adjusted U.S. savings bonds (I bonds). He plans to eventually use that cash to buy a rental property but would consider investing it in blue-chip stocks in the meantime should interest rates fall and render yields less attractive.

‚ÄúEvery month, I‚Äôm looking at inflation,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm not earning at least 1.5% more than inflation, I have to think about different strategies.‚Äù

What Trivedi and others decide is key to what happens next in markets. Expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates later this year spurred big rallies at the end of 2023, driving major indexes near records. That heat is beginning to dissipate. Some investors say markets have little room for further gains and are already priced for a perfect scenario, in which inflation moderates without significant job losses.

Wall Street is pinning its hopes on cash moving from money-market funds to provide the next big boost. Rates above 5% were flashy after years of safe investments offering little interest. Their fall could drive investors to U.S. stocks, which have historically provided the highest returns in the long run. 

Bond yields have declined from their peaks, but rates offered on Wall Street remain high relative to recent history, pulling cash toward money-market funds. Stocks also still look expensive, meaning bargain hunters might find rates on CDs more alluring than playing the market‚Äîfor now.

‚ÄúThe assets in money-market funds are staggering,‚Äù said Randy Gwirtzman, a portfolio manager at Baron Capital. ‚ÄúAll that dry powder is on the sidelines and waiting to invest.‚Äù 

Elizabeth Cathcart, 26, works in corporate finance at an investment firm in Denver. She says the math of homeownership has risen so much that without an aggressive investment strategy, it will be unattainable. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to pass up CDs over 5.5%, particularly for seven months. That‚Äôs not a bad deal,‚Äù said Cathcart. ‚ÄúBut 12 months or longer, I don‚Äôt want to lock away cash for that long. I‚Äôm young, I want to take more risk.‚Äù

Expectations for cash to pour into the market once rates fall may prove overly optimistic, however. Money-market funds raked in cash during previous Fed-tightening cycles but didn‚Äôt hemorrhage it when the central bank began to ease. Assets retreated from their peaks, but still plateaued at much higher levels.

Investors also tend to tap money markets during periods of market stress, not necessarily when yields are higher. Assets in money funds peaked at nearly half of the overall money supply in 2008. There was a similar spike in 2001, the aftermath of the dot-com bubble.

Francisco Pena, 30, a data scientist in New York City, said he is using short-term Treasurys, CDs and I bonds as a temporary home for his money. He is saving for a down payment with his husband.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want my cash sitting in a bank account, losing real purchasing power‚Äîespecially with inflation on the rise,‚Äù said Pena. If rates fell substantially, he would stick with a high-yield savings account to keep his cash at the ready.

There is some debate over how much of the assets in cash-like products should be thought of as investments, with potential to enter other parts of the market, versus as bank deposits to be saved or spent later on. Total deposits at U.S. lenders have fallen to $17.4 trillion from a peak of $18.2 trillion since the Fed began tightening policy in early 2022.

The path of interest rates will affect how much money is pulled from fixed-income products. In the past, rate cuts have often been large and rapid, aimed at stemming a crisis. Wall Street foresees a smoother glide path this time around, with rates ending up much higher than near zero, where they sat for years. Traders‚Äô base case is for the federal-funds rate to remain above 3% in the coming years. Fed officials expect the benchmark rate to decline to 2.9% by the end of 2026.

Mark Wiggins, 27, a management consultant living in Miami Beach, Fla., is currently stashing 17% of his income in a high-interest savings account earning 4.4%. Another 13% goes into his 401(k). When rates were lower, he would invest a percentage of his paycheck directly into stocks and crypto. He is planning to invest a significant chunk of his savings. 

‚ÄúIf rates fall below 3.5%, I would probably cut the amount I‚Äôm putting into my savings and instead direct deposit to my investment brokerage or crypto,‚Äù he said.",2024-01-18,0

1) Price collapses post lockup as early investors cash out at IRRs above their threshold.

2) Reddit subs such as WSB pump up the stock, turning the platform itself into a meme stock in an ironic new form of decentralized market manipulation

3) regulatory scrutiny increases as aggressive ad targeting leads to market instability. Mod content filtering receives increased scrutiny and as a result, content becomes either farther right leaning (X) or self enforcing echo chambers for foreign adversary interference (going into 2024 election)

Edit 1/19- Reddit removes hundreds of millions of posts a year, even the # of Manual mods reviews is shocking

I've been closely observing the market trends and have a keen interest in two specific sectors: semiconductors and uranium. With the undeniable surge in AI popularity, companies like NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel seem to be at a crucial juncture.

Furthermore, with the growing emphasis on clean energy, uranium stocks like Uranium Energy Corp are catching my eye. In your view, is this an opportune time to invest in such companies?

Just trying to familiarize myself with some of the most talked about investment opportunities in the market right now as well as potential stock picks for each. Feel free to correct any info here or add on more. Just looking to start a discussion on the different hot topics lately and the following stock picks that go along with them! I know there are several other big opportunities like weed,crypto,etc just didn‚Äôt wanna go overboard 

**Lithium ( MALRY, LAC)**

 The booming EV market, along awith the growing demand for renewable energy storage, positions lithium as a key investment opportunity. Major automaker's substantial investments in EVs drive the need for lithium-ion batteries, while the increasing focus on sustainable energy ensures a sustained demand for lithium. Despite global lithium deposits, the challenge of securing a stable and cost-effective supply persists, presenting investment potential in companies involved in lithium exploration, mining, and battery production.

  
**GPUs (NVIDIA, AMD, INTL )**

 Demand for GPUs comes from AI and machine learning for handling big data in areas like healthcare and finance. Data centers need GPUs for cloud computing as businesses shift operations online. In the gaming industry, GPUs are crucial for high-quality graphics in video games. Cryptocurrency mining, particularly for coins like Ethereum, relies on GPUs for their processing power. Overall, the demand is driven by the growing need for high-performance GPUs in AI, data centers, gaming, and cryptocurrency mining. 

**Uranium (BHP, NXE )** 

The demand for uranium primarily stems from its crucial role in fueling nuclear power generation. As global efforts to transition to cleaner energy sources intensify, the demand for nuclear energy has been on the rise, particularly in emerging economies like China and India. This growing demand, coupled with supply constraints and geopolitical factors affecting uranium production, creates a decent investment opportunity. As countries strive to meet their energy needs while minimizing carbon emissions, uranium stands out as a key component in the clean energy landscape.

It should get a major boost from Generative AI opportunities, which need 5-6 times more memory than traditional applications.DRAM and NAND pricing has shot up higher and faster than any outlet has expected, which is attributed to historically low contract prices, which have motivated buyers to stock up, maintaining robust demand even as prices head upward.

Homebuilder sentiment improved in January, jumping 7 points to 44 on the National Association of Home Builders monthly index. Anything below 50 is still considered negative, but the index has now moved 10 points higher in the last two months.

Sentiment is now at the highest level since September.

The increase coincides with a big drop in mortgage interest rates from around 8% in mid-October to the 6% range in December. Builders point squarely to that, and the effect on affordability, for growing confidence.

‚ÄúLower interest rates improved housing affordability conditions this past month, bringing some buyers back into the market after being sidelined in the fall by higher borrowing costs,‚Äù said Alicia Huey, NAHB chairman and a custom home builder and developer from Birmingham, Alabama. ‚ÄúSingle-family starts are expected to grow in 2024, adding much needed inventory to the market.

They keep manufacturing a very diversified range of cars from cheap boring to supercars (indirectly through child brands, but still), and even though its sales isn‚Äôt expected to be growing as much as Tesla, but comparing the two is still a joke, and in my opinion Tesla will never be even close to sales of Volkswagen.

I don‚Äôt mean to start comparing the two, and soon it won‚Äôt even be relevant as Tesla is not an automobile only company, but let‚Äôs be honest - electric, and self driving cars becoming less and less exotic. Volkswagen is quick to adapt, and pick up latest technologies to put in their cars and sell them for cheap. They provide good price value ratio, and for most people that‚Äôs what counts.

I don‚Äôt plan on taking any positions but I thought it was a very interesting case study in what can go wrong when you attempt to take advantage of arbitrage plays when a merger/buyout occurs. 

Looking at their financials SAVE is hard to justify even their now current valuation of ~$900mm. Their operating expenses are 20% higher than their gross profit and they effectively lose nearly a quarter billion dollars on an annual basis. But the prospect of a buyout deal at $33/share sent the stock price skyrocketing. The big issue is that the entirety of those gains rested on the deal going through. I have no doubt that some people made good money over the last 6 months or so but I‚Äôm also sure plenty of people‚Äôs hearts were in their throats seeing the plunge yesterday.

I thought this was a really interesting example of how playing an expected merger/buyout could go wrong and a lesson on checking the value of underlying assets.",2024-01-17,0

A federal judge blocked JetBlue Airways purchase of budget rival Spirit Airlines, a major win for Biden‚Äôs Justice Department, which sued to stop the merger, alleging it would drive up fares for some of the most price-sensitive consumers.  
  
JetBlue‚Äôs proposed $3.8 billion purchase of discounter Spirit would have produced the country‚Äôs fifth-largest airline, a deal the carriers said would help them better grow and compete against larger rivals like Delta and United.  
  
The decision, handed down Tuesday by a federal judge in Boston, marks a victory for a Justice Department that has aggressively sought to block deals it views as anticompetitive.  
  
‚ÄúJetBlue‚Äôs plan would eliminate the unique competition that Spirit provides‚Äîand about half of all ultra-low-cost airline seats in the industry‚Äîand leave tens of millions of travelers to face higher fares and fewer options,‚Äù the Justice Department alleged in its lawsuit in March.  
  
Spirit shares plunged after the decision was announced and were down 60%, while JetBlue shares swung between gains and losses.  
  
Neither airline immediately commented on the decision.

JetBlue has said access to Spirit‚Äôs similar fleet of Airbus planes would allow it to grow quickly when planes and pilots are in short supply, growth it argues it needs to compete against bigger airlines. Years of previous consolidation left United, Delta, American and Southwest in control of about three-quarters of domestic market.  
  
The decision leaves New York-based JetBlue grappling with next steps, tasking incoming CEO Joanna Geraghty with steering the airline on a new path. Geraghty was announced as successor to CEO Robin Hayes after he said earlier this month that he would retire.  
  
The airline operates in highly congested airspace in New York and other cities, and had planned to use Spirit as a way to gain access to more routes and travelers.  
  
JetBlue planned to remodel Spirit‚Äôs yellow planes by removing the branding and seats from the tightly-packed planes to provide more of a full-service model.  
  
Spirit had grown rapidly in recent years by offering cheap fares and fees for everything else from seat assignments to carry-on luggage.

1509,Insight for interest rate movements in 1H2024,4,1988wg9,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1988wg9/insight_for_interest_rate_movements_in_1h2024/,0,"Having time to listen to the webcast ([https://www.brookings.edu/events/a-conversation-with-federal-reserve-governor-christopher-waller](https://www.brookings.edu/events/a-conversation-with-federal-reserve-governor-christopher-waller)) this afternoon, it is believed that FOMC **will not follow** the market expectation to lower interest rates 6 times in 2024, even the market is still **demanding** for 3 interest rate cuts in 1H2024.

Waller explicitly mentioned that the job data tended to be revised downward for most of 2023 - which is in fact saying that even the data is suggesting a rate cut, he will prefer to wait for another month to confirm.

Consider the voting members in 2024 would be generally hawkish, trust that FOMC will keep waiting in 1Q2024, hence the market's dream will not come true ......

NB: Waller, Bostic and Daly are FOMC voters in 2024.

**Almost as Good as It Gets‚Ä¶But Will It Last? (Christopher J. Waller, 16 January 2024)**

[https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240116a.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240116a.htm)

*The unemployment rate in December held steady at 3.7 percent while employers added 216,000 jobs, which was more than expected and an increase from the 173,000 created in November and 105,000 in October. While that looks like a modest acceleration in job creation, I remind myself that revisions to monthly payrolls have been downward for most of 2023‚Äîfrom the first to the third estimate employment gains were revised down in 9 of 10 job reports. Given this recent history of revisions, there is a good chance December will be revised down. Furthermore, with growth expectations moderating over coming quarters, employment gains are likely to slow. We can see that this is already happening if we look at progress over the previous quarters. Average monthly payroll gains over the fourth quarter were 165,000, a step down from the 221,000 average in the third quarter and 257,000 in the first half of 2023. This data shows an improving balance between labor supply and demand.*

*As long as inflation doesn't rebound and stay elevated, I believe the FOMC will be able to lower the target range for the federal funds rate this year. This view is consistent with the FOMC's economic projections in December, in which the median projection was three 25-basis-point cuts in 2024. Clearly, the timing of cuts and the actual number of cuts in 2024 will depend on the incoming data. Risks that would delay or dampen my expectation for cuts this year are that economic activity that seems to have moderated in the fourth quarter of 2023 does not play out; that the balance of supply and demand in the labor market, which improved over 2023, stops improving or reverses; and that the gains on moderating inflation evaporate.*

Marketing Challenge: Apple has priced the Vision Pro, which has ‚Äùlimited battery life, an unwieldy design and no killer app,‚Äù at* ***$3,499***, *Gurman said in the* *weekly Power On newsletter*.

*The company is bracing for an initial sales surge, courtesy of the early adopters, followed by a tapering off of demand, he said, adding that retail stores may need twice as much inventory space ‚Äúduring the opening weekend than afterward.‚Äù*

*With Apple‚Äôs previous devices such as the iPod, the iPad, the iPhone and even the Watch, shoppers didn‚Äôt require a lot of ‚Äùcoaxing and coaching,‚Äù the columnist noted.*

*‚ÄùThe Vision Pro will be a different beast. Few consumers are accustomed to wearing a mixed-reality headset, and Apple's model requires particular care,‚Äù Gurman said.* *‚ÄúIf the device isn't fitted to someone's head correctly ‚Äî or is missing the right lenses ‚Äî the entire experience could be ruined, potentially costing Apple a $3,499 sale forever.‚Äù*

*Apple Does Groundwork: ‚ÄùApple has prepared its most sophisticated sales pitch ever, including a demo lasting up to 25 minutes ‚Äî longer than it takes to watch your favorite sitcom,‚Äù Gurman said. The company has also trained several hundred employees at its offices in Cupertino, he added. ‚ÄúTo make sure retail staffers get everything right,‚Äù Apple hosted several hundred employees at its offices this month in Cupertino to walk them through the process, the columnist said.*

*Gurman noted that the customer* ***demos will begin at Apple‚Äôs U.S. retail stores on the launch date***, *with sign-ups beginning at 8 a.m. local time. More than a dozen demo units will be made available simultaneously at the largest stores, with dedicated sit-down areas where presentations will take place, he said*.

***The Modus Operandi: Gurman outlined the demo process as follows:*** *retail store worker scans user‚Äôs face with an app, similar to setting up Face ID. Scan will help decide on the light seal, foam cushion and band size that suits the customer*. *If the user wears glasses, the store worker will use a device to scan lenses for prescription information. All these details gathered by the worker will be handed over to a staffer in the store‚Äôs backroom to assemble the demo Vision Pro with correct accessories. The store employee will then hand the demo device to the customer and explain how the interface works, including how to control the pointer using a user's eyes, how to gesture to make selections and how to hold the headset. Once the headset is on, the customer will need to calibrate the device with various tracking and tapping exercises so it can follow their eyes and hands. As the 20- to 25-minute demo begins, the user will be directed to the photo apps followed by examples of panorama shots. The customer will then see 3D images, following which the user will be shown how to use the device as a computer or iPad replacement. The customer will then be shown 3D and immersive movies, including clips of wild animals, the ocean and sports. Demo devices will be preloaded with various third-party apps that are launching with the device next month*.

*‚ÄùThe goal of the demos is giving users an experience that's compelling but not exhausting ‚Äî ideally leaving them itching for more,‚Äù Gurman said. The key issue, the columnist said, is making sure customers stay comfortable while wearing the Vision Pro. This, however, could be challenging, as several retail employees have already said that they felt their heads were tired and sweaty after only using the device for a half hour, he said. Apple also aims to ensure that product reviewers will get the best experience by having them participate in two in-person sessions with the company before being sent a device, Gurman said.*

*Still, none of these measures will ensure success within the next year or two as the product is just too expensive and cumbersome to win over mainstream consumers, he said.*

*‚ÄúBut looking out a few years ‚Äî once the price and weight go down, and there are more compelling features ‚Äî Apple may have laid the groundwork for something big,‚Äù the Apple specialist said.*

*Apple ended Friday‚Äôs session up 0.18% at $185.92, according to Benzinga Pro.*

***\*Ampere:***

*Ampere Analysis predicts direct-to-consumer streaming businesses of all major U.S. media companies ‚Äì sans any sports streaming operations ‚Äì will achieve consistent profitability within 18 months.*

*In analysis released Wednesday, the firm pegs* ***Disney*** *as poised to get there first (as early as calendar Q1 2024) but followed in short order by* ***Warner Bros***. *Discovery (predicted profitability by Q3 2024), with* ***Paramount*** *and* ***NBCUniversal*** *close on others‚Äô heels (both projected to reach the goal by Q1 2025). It should be noted analysis of NBCU only takes into account U.S.-based Peacock streaming operations and not Comcast‚Äôs traditional pay TV-led services or Sky Showtime. And taking sports out of the equation is another significant caveat.*

*Disney, in its most recent earnings report grew DTC revenue 12% year over year to $5.04 billion, while narrowing DTC operating losses substantially to $420 million (compared to $1.4 billion DTC losses in the same period a year prior.) Disney‚Äôs DTC operations include Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+. The company in 2023 implemented a broader cost-cutting initiative that included cutting 7,000 jobs globally and put it on track to slash costs by roughly $7.5 billion.*

*‚ÄúNot only have all the major studio streamers now laid the groundwork for profitability‚Ä¶but they all also look likely to turn streaming direct into significant sources of profit,‚Äù wrote Ampere in its report. By 2028, Ampere expects studios will generate between $1 billion and $2 billion in annual EBIT from streaming businesses, based on their current market footprint ‚Äì with further geographic expansion leading to even greater potential upside.*

*Alongside cost-cutting measures and spending pullbacks Ampere pointed to the embrace of ad-supported products as the second key factor in driving a shift toward profitability. It pegged advertising as a ‚Äúwild card opportunity‚Äù that could generate significantly more growth than currently modeled.*

.................................................................................

***\*LightShed:***

*Analysts at LightShed say ‚Äúwe are even more convinced today than 2018 that legacy media companies are making a mistake and all need to radically alter their streaming strategies.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúAll four are laser focused on eliminating streaming losses and shoring up balance sheets rather than growing the most robust and profitable long-term streaming business,‚Äù wrote analysts led by Richard Greenfield in a December 19 post.*

*LightShed shared prescriptions for streaming businesses of each media company, some of which it thinks should be shut down altogether ‚Äì including* ***Peacock***. *The firm noted operating losses for Peacock since launch will come in at more than $7.5 billion at the end of 2023, ‚Äúwith NO obvious path to Peacock ever paying back Comcast‚Äôs investment.‚Äù LightShed suggested Comcast could shift away from a focus on sports to make Peacock look more like Starz ‚Äì or possibly merge it with both Starz and Showtime. They also advised the ad-supported version of Peacock could be revamped as a FAST service leaning on NBCU‚Äôs TV and film catalog.\**

*For* ***Disney***, *one piece of advice from the firm is to abandon plans for a flagship ESPN direct-to-consumer product and move prime ESPN+* *content to a combined Hulu-Disney+ app; ‚ÄúWe believe Disney has to pick one streaming business to focus* *ALL of the company‚Äôs energy and resources; in turn, Disney should focus their efforts on the streaming platform where they have full control of the IP/content versus licensing sports rights from third-parties,‚Äù wrote the analysts*.

*As for* ***Paramount***, *LightShed doesn‚Äôt see ‚Äúhow Paramount+ can earn a compelling payback on the billions of dollars that have already been invested‚Äù and would scale back the SVOD right away and reverse course on the integration of Showtime, among other steps. Ultimately the firm expects Paramount will be sold.*

*LightShed also doesn‚Äôt have a rosy view of* ***Warner Bros***; *‚ÄúWith the accelerating collapse of linear TV, we simply do not believe Warner Bros. Discovery has the ability to become a leading global streaming competitor with enough scale to drive profitable growth,‚Äù the firm stated*.

*The analysts said WBD should rebrand the Max SVOD service as HBO and get rid of content that doesn‚Äôt fit the brand (meaning newly integrated assets such as Discovery content and CNN), while keeping Discovery+ as a standalone niche streaming service.*

*Finally, the firm doesn‚Äôt see M&A as the answer to media companies‚Äô streaming struggles, as LightShed said it‚Äôs too late and companies are ‚Äúnot equipped talent-wise or strategy-wise‚Äù to build global streaming services on top of linear TV businesses facing growing headwinds. It also sees regulatory approval as a challenge:*

‚Äú*Legacy media companies simply do not have time to wait and hope for M&A as a strategy,‚Äù wrote Greenfield. ‚ÄúThey must take action to alter their streaming strategies immediately or their stocks will continue to suffer*.‚Äù‚ÄÇ

1515,"Everything I'm watching and Analysing in premarket 16/01. Includes analysis of Tesla, Forex and Levels to Watch for the day",56,1982rn5,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1982rn5/everything_im_watching_and_analysing_in_premarket/,5,"**ANALYSIS:**

* We are seeing a slight decline in premarket. That‚Äôs in part due to the sell off in AAPL and TSLA, which are big components of the indices. 
* But we can look more into it and see that there have been a rebalancing of rate cut bets for March this morning, following UK employment data. The chance of rate cut in march is now showing at 66% vs 77% on Friday on CME Fedwatch tool, with chance of no cut rising to 30%.   

* This is the result of the move higher in USD in premarket, reaching 1 month highs at the key level of 103.3 on DXY.   

* This is in part due to UK employment data which came strong, even though the wage growth came in lower, which led GBP lower.   

* We cans ee that because of this volatility in the dollar in premarket, traders are hedging with OTM put options, which has brought skew down slightly. But money flow block traders remain v high.   

* Vix has jumped, will likely come down and can fuel buy the dip later in session.   
This is confirmed by selling of puts on nasdaq.   

* Key levels to watch on TESLA are at 200, a smaller level at 210.
* Key level on AAPL is 180.
* NVDA and MSFt, both of which have more bullish positioning than other Mag 7 firms, are both green in premarket, but barely.   


**Let‚Äôs look at positioning on IWM, since I have been requested this a few times.**   


* Spot price is below the key gamma level of 195, and block trade flows are showing increased short selling from hedge funds. Skew is lwoer too. 
* All in all, it looks like IWM is positioned to move lower in short term.
* We can see from the blue line below that hedge funds have been taking profit since the start of the year. 
* Main options are selling fo call options which is bearish.   

* [https://imgur.com/a/EwscBn0](https://imgur.com/a/EwscBn0)    

* Theres a gamma level at 190, which is likely to be the low of the day.   
Below that, Put support is at 185.    


**Now a bit on FX:**

* Skew is pulling back a bit on EURUSD after data this morning. We are seeing traders hedge their long with OTM put with strike 1.08.
* Still, open interest on 1.10 is v high, we can expect a reversal tot here hopefully soon, depending on data.   


**INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH**  


* Goldman Sachs released a report that earnings momentum has trended down since the start of Q4 2023, following weakness in Euro area PMIs. They highlighted the chart below to show how profit downgrades have outpaced profit upgrades over the past few months, despite equity prices moving higher. They used this as evidence to suggest equity prices can do some correction this earnings season. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/yMaIKSV](https://imgur.com/a/yMaIKSV)    

* Deutsche Bank put out a piece where they were clear outliers against the consensus expectation for Q4 2023 earnings to tick lower. Dutch bank. Expects them to come out at record highs. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/hz97aZ9](https://imgur.com/a/hz97aZ9)    

* Blackrock put out a piece where they argued that the optimism on rate cuts in the US is currently overdone. In a similar piece, Barclays moved back their expectation of first rate cuts in March, now expecting the first rate cut to be in June. Goldman is currently an outlier, as they still anticipate first rate cut for Fed in March, with ECB and BOE tor ollow later.    

* Bank of America said in their EPFR report that flows into equity funds went negative this past week to -9.5b from +4.4b the week before.   


**DATA LEDE:**

* Australia WESTPAC consumer confidence index decline slightly from 82.1 to 81. It has remained in this range of 79 to 82 for much of the year so this is no major concern.   

* Japan PPI comes in hotter than expected, at 0.3% MOM vs 0% forecast. YOY at 0% vs -0.3% forecast.  
PPI is a leading indicator of CPI. YOY flat for first time since feb 2021, no increase. That‚Äôs probably not great for BOJ who want to see persistently higher inflation.  

* **UK EMPLOYMENt NUMBERS:**  
Employment change came stronger than expected at 73k vs 50k forecast. This is the highest read since April last year. Points to a stronger than expected jobs market.   
Unemployment rate came in line with expectations at 4.2%  
Average earnigns incl bonus came less than expected, at 6.5% vs 6.8% forecast.   

* We can see it was a mixed bag. Jobs report mostly came stronger than expected, in the headline employment change number, but the wage inflation aspect came less than expected, and that‚Äôs indicative of future services inflation.   
GBP mostly flat on this, although USD is higher, which is hurting the GBPUSD pair.   
Makes sense GBP relatively flat as rate cut bets are steady after the data, with 134BPS of 2024 cuts priced.   

* **ZEW economic index for Euro and Germany both came stronger than expected, Germany‚Äôs came as highest since February last year.**   
Survey showed that more than 2/3 of respondents expect rate cuts by Fed in next 6 months.   


**FOREX:**

* AUD is following Chinese markets lower, compounded by the weaker confidence number.   

* GBP itself is relatively flat, slightly lower following employment change, but USD is rallying which is hurting the GBPUSD pair. Makes sense GBP relatively flat as rate cut bets are steady after the data, with 134BPS of 2024 cuts priced.   

* Euro partly lower as 1 year inflation expectations drop to 1.5 year low.   

* Yen slightly higher after PPI numbers, but USDJPY higher on rising dollar.   

* DXY up 0.6% to a key level of 103.3  

* AUDUSD sitting at 0.66 key level. 
* EURUSD broke below 1.09 level
* GBP 1.26 as support.   


**MARKETS:**

* European markets lower as they follow EURUSD lower this morning. Yesterday was at resistance of 16800, but fell yesterday back to 16.6k. Continued lower during Asian session, then during Europe open.   

* HKG50 - broke 16k, now trading at 15.87k. Moving lower as Taiwan election and lack of rate cuts yesterday hurt sentiment slightly.   

* SPX: Rejected at 4800 on Friday. Yesterday was flat due to public holiday, around 4780. Moved slightly lwoer during European session.   
AAPL weighing on index, down 1.8% in premarket. TSLA down 1.7%  

* NASDAQ: down 0.5% in premarket, trading at 16,750. Its below the 2021 high, will be trying to recover this level. Can get rejected there.   

* Oil - North Dakota oil production is down 400k barrels per day due to freezing weather, which as a supply restriction, should support price. The fundamentals of the oil market with the Rede Sea tensions is supporting oil, as it maintains the green despite rising dollar which would normally Drag oil into the red.   

* US Bond yields moving slightly higher today.   


**KEY LEVELS TO WATCH BASED ON THE OPTIONS MARKET:**  


* **SPX**:
* Call resistance remains at 4800. This will be a big barrier to break and will be a big resistance.   
We are seeing some gamma building on 4825, but is small. But some traders are looking higher now. 
* HVL is 4745, there‚Äôs a big gamma level around 4750-4745. We can expect this to act as some support.   

* Low of the day if we get there is likely to be 4740, says my quant.   
4750/4745 to offer some support before then probably. 
* High of the day likely to be 4800.  

* These levels were drawn without the TESLA, AAPL news included. A big move in AAPL and TESLA and these levels can break.   

* **QQQ**:
* Call resistance at 410 which will be hard to break. 
* If we do break that then next gamma level up is at 412.   

* Key areas of support are at 406 which is the HVL  
Then below that, the min of the day that my quant is telling me is 404. Expect a bounce from there.   

* That‚Äôs around the low of the day from Thursday for those wondering.   


**MAG 7 NEWS:**  


* AAPL - has offered Chinese customers a 5% discount on iPhone 15s, in a bid to try to drum up demand, in what is currently a flagging market for them.   

* AAPL has also decided to remove their blood oxygen sensor from their watch, in order to avoid the US ban. US customs has said that with this change, they won‚Äôt be subject to the ban. AAPL working to roll out the adjusted watch. The ruling for the ban has been taken to an appeals court and expected verdict is today.

1516,2024 will suffer further decline in broadband; early signals point to a return to growth in 2025 & current pockets of growth will mitigate,0,1981nrz,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1981nrz/2024_will_suffer_further_decline_in_broadband/,2,"***DELL'ORO GROUP*** *January 11th 2024.* ***2024 Outlook: Broadband Market Faces Challenge Amidst Lower Spending from 2023:***

**‚Äú*****Inventory Correction is the root cause of 2023‚Äôs broadband spending slowdown*** *which will likely persist well into 2024. Without the benefit of fourth quarter numbers, total spending on broadband equipment in 2023 is expected to show a decline of around 10%. Early projections for 2024 indicate an additional 5% year-over-year decrease, as the lagging impact of interest rate increases to curb inflation will be felt more acutely. This additional 5% decrease would put total spending to around $16.5 B‚Äîroughly equal to 2021 spending levels*.  
  
***The expected declines in 2023 and 2024*** *follow three straight years of white-hot growth in broadband network and service investments from 2020 to 2022. During this period,  year-over-year growth rates reached 9%, 15%, and 17%, respectively. Similar periods of growth from 2003-2006 and 2010-2014 were both followed by two subsequent years of reduced spending, as operators‚Äîparticularly in China‚Äîshifted their capital expenditure focus from broadband to mobile RAN.*  
  
***The silver lining here is that very early signals regarding 2025 show a return to growth****, as BEAD and other subsidization efforts begin to trickle down to broadband equipment suppliers. Well before that, pockets of growth in fixed wireless CPE, cable DAA equipment and CPE, and continued spending on PON equipment by tier 2 and tier 3 operators should make the broadband market one in which the headlines might communicate malaise, but a peek under the hood shows clear signs of resilience powering an inevitable return to growth*.  


*Cable Operators Travel Different Paths to Fend off Fixed Wireless and Fiber Just like last year, in the minds of cable consumers,* ***cable operators find themselves stuck battling against the perception*** *that they are the provider with inferior copper technology that can‚Äôt be flexible when it comes to offering plans that meet a consumer‚Äôs budget, like fixed wireless currently can. As a result of this situation, larger cable operators are seeing increased broadband subscriber churn and quarters of net subscriber losses.*  
  
***Comcast is pushing hard to counter those perceptions*** *and is already offering its X-Class Internet tiers. Meanwhile, in 2024,* ***Charter‚Äôs Remote PHY and vCMTS rollouts will kick into high gear****.*

1517,American Companies Plan on Becoming Employers‚Äô Landlords by Building Company Towns,887,1981mys,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1981mys/american_companies_plan_on_becoming_employers/,478,"https://decodetoday.com/american-companies-building-company-towns/

Article body:

The housing crisis in the United States has prompted some major companies to consider building company towns. Instead of relying on traditional rental properties, companies such as Google, Tesla, and Meta are exploring the idea of becoming landlords themselves, building company towns, and purchasing large pieces of land to provide housing for their workers.

In the early 20th century, company towns were a common sight, designed to provide housing, schools, stores, and a sense of community for workers. Fast forward to the present day, and Silicon Valley giants are revisiting this concept, exploring the creation of self-contained communities for their workforce. While the concept of company towns is not new, this modern approach involves providing a range of amenities and services within the community, such as parks, restaurants, and shops, to create a sense of community and improve the work-life balance of employees.

Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, is planning to build an entire town near Austin, Texas, where three of his companies, Boring, Tesla, and SpaceX, have operations. The new company town is intended to offer below-market rents to his employees, providing an attractive solution to the housing challenges faced by many workers. Similarly, Meta, the parent company of Facebook, is also considering the construction of a company town to provide housing for its employees. Google is already in the process of building a 153-acre neighborhood near its headquarters in Mountain View, California, which will include over 7,000 residential units and 26 acres of public parks and open space.

While the idea of corporate-built company towns addresses the pressing issue of housing shortages, it has also sparked concerns about employee flexibility. With health insurance already tied to employment, intertwining housing with work could further limit an individual‚Äôs freedom to change jobs or locations. Critics argue that this deliberate entanglement is an attempt by companies to exert greater control over their workforce.

In response to these developments, legislation has been introduced to address the growing need for affordable housing. The proposed Workforce Housing Tax Credit Act seeks to provide states and developers with a new source of funding for the production of affordable rental housing. The Workforce Housing Tax Credit (WHTC) Act aims to incentivize the creation of housing for middle-income families. However, skeptics question the true intentions behind the legislation, speculating that it may serve as a tool for companies to claim tax credits while gaining additional influence over their employees.

The trend of companies building towns for their employees is not confined to the United States. Globally, mega-projects like NEOM are emerging as examples where entire towns are being constructed to accommodate workers. This global phenomenon highlights the evolving nature of the employer-employee relationship and the growing influence of corporations in shaping the living environments of their workforce.",2024-01-16,0
1518,"Red Sea disruption prolonged may curb effort in fighting inflation and delay interest rate cuts, pressure on stock markets",98,198186g,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/198186g/red_sea_disruption_prolonged_may_curb_effort_in/,33,"Recall that the long expected interest rate cuts forecast had been boosting the stock markets in the second half of December 2023, however the prolonged Red Sea disruption may curb effort in fighting inflation and delay interest rate cuts, which in turns add pressure on stock markets.

Whilst a few companies have already indicated that the Red Sea disruption will affect their supply chain, it will be worthwhile to rethink (1) what will be the additional cost involved in the transition period and (2) is it only last for two to four weeks only?

In fact, the recent action taken by the US and the UK, as well as the disclosures made by different companies, have implicitly shown that both North America and Europe are still relying heavily on Asia to supply raw materials and finished / consumer goods.

Based on the ongoing news, we may simply focus on the soaring logistics / insurance costs. Yet, let's consider the idle costs as well (e.g. factories need to temporary shut down, not enough goods to be sold in the stores, etc), which will cause top line and bottom line tumble at the same time - **especially for those relying on business across Europe and Asia**.

At the same time, some companies were saying that the impact would be two to four weeks only (given the voyage via Cape of Good Hope is 10 days longer). However, it will not be the case since shipping companies tend to combine / consolidate shipments, in order to maintain their profit level. That said, the waiting time at each stopping point will be longer unless it is a chartered vessel and **the potential impact will be far from two to four weeks**.

**More oil tankers shun southern Red Sea after US-led strikes in Yemen (15 January 2024)**

[https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/more-oil-tankers-shun-southern-red-sea-after-us-led-strikes-yemen-2024-01-15](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/more-oil-tankers-shun-southern-red-sea-after-us-led-strikes-yemen-2024-01-15)

*At least six more oil tankers were steering clear of the southern Red Sea on Monday, as disruptions increase on the vital route for energy shipping in the wake of U.S.-led strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen.*

*Prior to the strikes it had been mostly container ships which were avoiding the Red Sea, with oil tanker traffic largely unchanged in December.*

*But since the CMF (Combined Maritime Forces)'s warning, a growing number of oil tankers are avoiding the region, increasing the potential for disruptions to oil supply via the Suez Canal in both directions.*

*Reuters on Monday counted six tankers that had altered their course, making a total of at least fifteen vessels to do so since the start of the strikes, ship tracking data from LSEG and Kpler showed.*

*Vessels transiting the Red Sea have faced attacks over the past several weeks from Yemen-based Houthis, prompting shipping companies to change routes, leading to a spike in freight rates.Longer detours around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa have pushed ocean freight rates up to $10,000 per 40-foot container.If this goes on for three to six months the profits will again slowly approach 2022 levels, said an NVOCC.*

*The re-routing of a growing number of ships around Africa to avoid potential attacks in the Red Sea is altering refueling patterns and boosting demand for bunker fuel at far-flung ports, from the Mauritius to South Africa to the Canary Islands.*

*Ships are also expected to top up more at Singapore and Rotterdam, the two busiest bunkering ports and where fuel is competitively priced, as they try to hedge against uncertainty over route changes, traders and analysts said.*

*Bunker fuel demand has risen at ports including Mauritius' Port Louis, Gibraltar and ports in the Canary Islands and South Africa, said traders and industry sources, with sales jumping in Cape Town and Durban.*

*Prices of low-sulphur bunker fuel delivered at Cape Town have jumped 15% to almost $800 per metric ton since mid-November when the attacks started, data from bunker supplier Integr8 Fuels showed.*

*Spot premiums for prompt low-sulphur bunker fuel delivered at Singapore rose to $25 to $30 a metric ton above cargo quotes in mid-January, climbing from about $20 in early January, said industry sources.*

*The lengthy diversions for ocean cargo vessels as a result of the Houthi rebel attacks in the Red Sea have caused air freight volumes to soar, and the cost of shipping cargo by plane will see a significant increase if the crisis does not abate, with anxiety rising among companies.*

*The current spike in use of air freight is primarily in cargo volumes bound for Europe, as more companies avoid the longer Red Sea diversions around Africa‚Äôs Cape of Good Hope, according to Xeneta, a leading ocean and air freight rate benchmarking platforms.*

*Flights are already on average 93% full from a cargo perspective, and it is likely air freight rates will increase much more than 10% if the current increase in demand continues.*

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

As a European I'm not really sure how big of a deal Peacock is in the US in the last few days but from what I've seen on the social media, it seems to be pretty big, thanks to streaming some recent football game. That's why I just kind started observing this stock but noticed that its price haven't really changed over the last week or so. Surely the hype couldn't have been priced in right.

1522,Kelly Criterion for Corporate Bonds,5,197qbfb,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/197qbfb/kelly_criterion_for_corporate_bonds/,0,"Here's a formula that will give you the Kelly Criterion (% Allocation of principal already committed to being invested in corporate bonds). It's basically how much of your capital you should risk given probabilities of success & win/loss ratios;

# K = d - ((1 - d) / (y / (1 - y/2)))

Where

d = default rate of corporate bond(s)

y = yield of corporate bond(s)

K = Kelly Criterion, % allocation of committed contributions to go towards the bond(s)

I believe this will work the best with bonds since win/loss and \[credit\] risks of default are for the most part defined & outlined. Your win value is absolute, your loss value is absolute, your win % is kind of absolute as it uses current default rates. This could work on any bond fund or well diversified bond holdings.

# Backtest:

The backtest was composed of simulating contributing $100 every month to a brokerage account, using the Kelly % to see how much of it gets invested and how much stays as cash, however the leftover cash is added to the cash balance which will always be higher than using the entire contribution to invest every time, and the Kelly % is based on TOTAL cash including $100 contribution to account, so the ""lack"" of contributions from using the Kelly % is just added onto the pool of free cash to use to invest for the next period. We're also assuming that cash to be held in a settlement fund yielding the risk-free rate. The other portfolio is 100% investment of the $100 contributions every time.

The fund simulated to invest in is LQD (US Corporate Bonds).

The backtest starts Q3 2003 up to Q3 2023, 20 years flat. There were 8 definable ""credit/rate/debt cycles"" so the sample size is acceptable enough. The total contributions were $8,000 ($100 \* 4Q \* 20Y)

Results:

Kelly Portfolio: **$13,239 (+65.5%, +$5,239)**

Full Contribution: $9,997 (+25%, +$1,997)

This is a +32.4% difference in the ending portfolio balance, 2.62x the 20 year gains, in favor of the Kelly portfolio.

1523,IBKR- Interactive Brokers: overview and valuation,17,197l7tg,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/197l7tg/ibkr_interactive_brokers_overview_and_valuation/,25,"Business overview  
  
Interactive Brokers (IBKR) is an electronic broker that has clients in over 200 countries worldwide. It makes money primarily through transaction fees and margin lending. 68% of its accounts are individuals and 22% through its introducing brokerage services.  
  
Ownership and management  
  
The company was founded by Thomas Peterffy in 1977. He is still chairman of the board and plays an active role in the company. The CEO is Milan Galik, the handpicked successor to Mr. Peterffy.   
  
The management/board still owns 75% of the company, while 25% is publicly held. The publicly held portion of the company functions as a holding company. The amount of insider selling gets mentioned frequently. The insiders all sell frequently and have for years. While the public float increases each year due to this selling, there are no new shares of the company being issued. The shares are just transitioning from private to public as insiders slowly sell their stake into the public market. This is an odd arrangement, while there is a large amount of stock that could be dumped on public markets it does not benefit the holders of that stock to do so in a way that tanks the stock price.  
  
This ownership team clearly has skin in the game, as a large portion of their personal wealth is tied to the company. Peterffy, who is almost 80 years old, has resolved his succession questions by establishing a handpicked CEO who is a long time company veteran.   
  
Growth drivers  
  
IBKR has two main growth drivers. First, they are signing up new clients. As of December 2023 they had a 20% y/y increase in accounts. Their customers are relatively evenly divided between North America, Europe, and Asia. While they are a small player in the US market, They are growing rapidly in developing markets, many of which do not have many options for individuals to invest.   
  
Second, higher interest rates have increased the net interest margins on their margin loans. They advertise significantly lower rates than other large brokerages. They are able to do this through superior risk management and increased automation. This automation gives IBKR an advantage over brokerages such as Schwab. IBKR produces $1.48 million of revenue per employee, while Schwab generates $563,000.   
  
IBKR also has excellent risk management. They have no long term corporate debt (they have short term, client related debt which shows up on some screeners) and they invest their float only in short duration assets. As a result, during the SVB crisis, Schwab had serious issues with duration risk, while IBKR did not. This has also enabled IBKR to offer much higher interest rates on cash held in investment accounts. IBKR pays 4.8% while Schwab pays 0.45%. This makes IBKR more attractive to investors. As people come to expect higher returns on their money, IBKR is set up to take customers. Schwab (and other brokers) will have a hard time matching this as they invested in longer duration assets in search of yield.  
  
  
Risks  
  
A return to 0% interest rates would hurt the earnings of the company. Higher rates lead to higher margin loan rates, and more profitability. IBKR has proven to be profitable in a 0% rate environment, but (like many financial institutions) they are more so as rates rise. Central to my thesis is that rates will not go back to the levels of the last decade.   
  
There is regulatory risk for the company as they operate in 200+ markets. Thus far the company has proven adept at meeting these regulations. There is also the risk of a credit event causing loan losses. IBKR has successfully navigated numerous credit events in its history including: the GReat financial crisis, Savings and loan scandal, and the Asian Financial crisis. In its history none of these events caused large write downs, attesting to the quality risk management of the company. The largest write off they have had was when oil prices went negative during covid and they were unable to close out customer orders due to their software not being able to process negative commodity prices. This resulted in a $100 million writedown.  
  
The company currently pays a small dividend, but does not buyback stock. There are also significant currency risks as the company operates in so many markets.  
  
  
Valuation  
  
IBKR is tough to value because of its large private ownership. The enterprise value is around $43 billion while its market cap is around $9.5 billion. As you can get very different values depending on how you figure the size of the company. I‚Äôll generally be looking at the market cap, since that seems to be a popular way of valuing the company. It‚Äôs also how the company reports their earnings.  
  
The 5 year average P/E for the company is 22, and it is currently trading around 15x. This indicates its potentially undervalued, if there will be no changes to the business.  
  
There are two publicly traded comps for IBKR, those being Charles Schwab (SCHW) and Robin Hood (HOOD).   
  
Hood is similar in size to IBKR, both having around a $9 billion market cap. HOOD is trading around 5x sales and is not GAAP profitable. IBKR is trading at 1.3x sales and is profitable. IBKR has a much longer history and has regularly grown revenue in the mid teens.   
  
SCHW trades at 21x earnings and 5x sales, so it is trading at a premium to IBKR right now. Schwab has gross margins of 78% versus 93% for IBKR. However, Schwab puts up profit margins of 21% versus 8% for IBKR. Part of the reason for the discount might be the lower profit margins.   
  
If IBKR re-rates to a comparable multiple to its peers, there is about a 25% upside. The trailing 12 month EPS is $5.50, which at a 20x multiple would result in a stock price of $110. This would be in addition to the growth of the business, which has historically compounded at a mid-teens rate.. Morningstar has their fair value at $112, which supports this analysis.  
  
Closing thoughts  
  
While I think the company is trading at an attractive valuation, the ownership structure is concerning. I think this company will benefit greatly if rates stay higher. They also have a long growth runway. The public share dilution also would concern me as an owner, even though it's not technically dilution, I feel like my shares would become less valuable each year. The company is due to report earnings on January 16th, so there might be changes reported by the time anyone reads this. Currently, I have no position in this name.",2024-01-15,0

Due to the nature of P/E ratio (price divided by earnings) I trouble to fully understand why that may be the rule of thumb.

*For the long-term viability of ESPN aligning with the most powerful sports league would enhance its position as the network plans to move to direct to consumer by 2025.*

*What is cord cutting 2.0? Cord cutting 1.0 was cutting the cord on cable TV. In 2024, cord cutting 2.0 is about cutting the cord on expensive home Internet and getting new, less expensive options.*  
  
*Cord cutting 2.0 took off in 2023 as we saw Verizon and T-Mobile add 941,000 5G home Internet customers in the third quarter. That was up from the 890,000 they added in the second quarter. This news comes as most cable TV companies lost Internet subscribers in the third quarter of 2023.*  
  
*Cable broadband providers like Comcast and Spectrum are facing new competition not only from 5G home Internet services but also from fiber, fixed wireless access service providers, satellite services, and more. For the first time ever, Americans finally have options for home Internet, and they are starting to cut the Internet cord.*  
  
*This new access to more Internet service options has‚Äîfor the first time‚Äîmade it possible to completely break free from cable TV companies: Not only from the TV service but also from the Internet service.*

*New providers are not the only factor contributing to subscriber losses. Pricing is heavily factored into peoples‚Äô decisions on whether to switch providers.*  
  
*AT&T has also launched 5G home Internet services in 2023 to bring home Internet options to Americans who have not had options in the past.*  
  
*Much like in the early days of cord cutting 1.0, the growth of 2.0 is slow right now. We are waiting for more providers to join the market. Amazon announced plans to start offering home Internet next year. Other providers are quickly building out new kinds of Internet to give Americans options.*  
  
*Now as we move farther into 2024, cord cutting 2.0 is poised for rapid growth as Spectrum‚Äîone of the few cable TV companies to still be adding new Internet customers‚Äîsays it expects to lose customers in the fourth quarter of 2023.*

*Over the next five years, cable providers will have to deal with a growing number of competitors in a business that was once seen as their safe bet to fight cord cutting. Internet is the front line of the next generation of cord cutting.*""",2024-01-15,0

1532,An Exploration of Analyst Ratings and Stock Market Bias,15,196rajd,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/196rajd/an_exploration_of_analyst_ratings_and_stock/,11,"TLDR - Potential heavy bias on aggregated ratings towards buy/outperform ratings with virtually no sell/underperform ratings on aggregate. Is this justified in your opinion?  
Hello everyone,  
I‚Äôve embarked on an interesting project recently. I wanted to build a neural network model. The goal? To analyze stock data (fundamentals and price data) from Thompson Reuters and respective analyst ratings.  
The idea was to identify companies that are either unrated or not followed by analysts, and use the model to assign them theoretical ratings. Additionally, I wanted to spot companies with changing fundamentals that are likely to be re-rated soon, potentially leading to significant price movements.  
My dataset primarily consists of US-listed stocks across major exchanges and pink slips. However, it also includes stocks listed on the Frankfurt and London stock exchanges, as these are the three regions where I trade/invest. For more international exposure, I use ETFs.  
In total, my investable universe comprises around 17-18K stocks, with 7624 of them having an analyst following. Thompson Reuters provides a ‚Äúscore‚Äù from 1-5 for each stock, where 1 is a strong buy/overperform and 5 is a sell.  
To quickly clarify and avoid any confusion this initial test is only for aggregated ratings for stocks for example AAPL was recently given a downgrade by Barclays which led to it losing a considerable amount of market cap. However, the aggregate rating given for AAPL is still a ""Buy"".  
On aggregate, there‚Äôs a heavy skew to the upside, as seen below:  
Rating Number Percentage  
Hold 1488 19.5%  
Buy 3882 50.9%  
Overperform 2120 27.8%  
Underperform 117 1.5%  
Sell 17 0.2%  
This leads me to question the validity of these results. Should nearly 80% of stocks have a buy or outperform rating? Especially in a market that is relatively/historically quite expensive, this seems incredibly high.  
While I wouldn‚Äôt trade/buy based on any given analyst ratings, this project was more of a fun side venture. However, I‚Äôm somewhat disappointed with the results of this data-gathering stage, as any model trained in this way will be heavily biased and statistically insignificant unless you believe that the analysts on aggregate are correct.  
I plan to start gathering this data over time, but unless something significant happens to the economy, I‚Äôm not sure if the aggregate data will be that interesting, other than indicating a potential heavy bias.  
My next step is to examine the individual numbers for each stock in terms of the number of buys/holds/sells, etc., and see if I can derive something more meaningful to model as well as maybe try and explore the validity of the aggregated ratings. I enjoy creating models, even if they‚Äôre not always for practical purposes.  
This exploration has shown why downgrades seem to hit a company a lot harder than upgrades.  
I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on analyst ratings/reports in general as well as if you think that analyst ratings are justified or not.",2024-01-14,0

Would 500 randomly selected stocks have the same expected rate of return as the S&P 500? If no, why not? Based on some light internet research, there doesn't seem to be a clear answer, but wondering if there are any finance experts here who can provide more insight.

Edit: To further clarify my question, I understand how the S&P 500 works, and I know that it's composed of more competent companies than a random basket would be. However, my theory is that that increased competency is already baked into the prices of the stocks composing the S&P 500, meaning they're year on year growth is limited. I'm guessing a random basket will have much more volatile results on the high and low end, but at the end of the day, will have approximately the same returns.",2024-01-14,0

* The volume of applications for a mortgage increased 9.9% from one week earlier on a seasonally adjusted basis for the week ending Jan. 10, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA). Some of that activity was driven by purchase applications, which increased 6% from the previous week, as buyers capitalized on the year-end decline in rates and a small boost in inventory levels.

For rate-sensitive buyers who have been waiting on the sidelines, these first few weeks of the year could offer a window to purchase, experts said. Still, any relief in affordability could be short-lived.

Bidding wars are already erupting in some areas of the US, which could drive up home prices among the few attractive listings. Additionally, new economic data this week could sway the Federal Reserve to postpone its planned rate cuts ‚Äî keeping rates higher for longer.

According to Redfin, mortgage-purchase applications were up 3% compared to a month ago during the first week of January. Redfin agents also reported requests for tours were up 5% from this time in December, and there were 9% more new listings on the market in the four weeks ending Jan. 7 compared to a year ago.

""Right now, I think the majority of our agents all over the country expected to have a busy first few weeks in January given consults,"" Redfin spokesperson Allison Braun told Yahoo Finance. ""However, given the storms that are pushing through the country [that‚Äôs] really leaving potential homebuyers at home and on the sidelines.""

By contrast, areas with good weather saw an uptick in activity. One Redfin agent in Phoenix noted an unusual uptick in activity this week.

""Telling my buyers to get in the market now, interest rates are lower and competition is low,"" said Phoenix premier agent Heather Mahmood-Corley. ""I imagine competition will really pick up in March and prices will start to soar. March really is a hot month here, the weather starts to get better.""

The uptick in competition, though, could erode that newfound affordability. According to Redfin, at least 24% of homes sold in the four weeks leading up to Jan. 7, sold above list price. On average, the median price of homes sold was $363,125, up 4.1% year over year.

Meanwhile, South Carolina-based president of Home Loans Inc. Jason Sharon, also noted a pickup in bidding wars in Charleston, S.C. ‚Äî as well as in Atlanta and Huntsville, Ala. Some of those buyers may also have been lured into the market by the influx of new listings.

""I am already seeing bidding wars in cities with good job markets,"" Sharon told Yahoo Finance. ""Generally, they are houses in good condition, at or below the median price point. If mortgage rates continue their slow decline, I believe we will see more buyers enter the market, causing even more bidding wars.""

Buyers were also picky about where they put their money.

""No one wants to do a fixer upper right now, unless it‚Äôs in a really desirable neighborhood and the price is right,"" Mayfield said. ""I was working with a first-time homebuyer recently. We put in six offers (in the 200 range) and all the houses we put offers on kept losing. One of the houses we put an offer on had 33 other offers.""

**'Demand will depend on mortgage rates'**

Though competition has seemingly begun to pick up in some segments of the US, mortgage rates could destabilize that momentum.

""Demand in the market, especially from first-time buyers, will likely depend a good deal on what happens with mortgage rates,"" Nicole Bachaud, Zillow senior economist, told Yahoo Finance. ""As it looks now, rates are likely to stay down from the 8% peak.""

Within the last three months, mortgage rates have plunged more than a full point to a low of 6.62% the week ending Jan. 4.

The dip in rates saved potential buyers an average of $325 on their monthly mortgage payment from the all-time high set in the four weeks ending Oct. 22, Redfin found. Still, at a rate of 6.62%, buyers would have an average payment of $2,399 ‚Äî up 7.4% year-over-year.

""While lower rates might sound like a saving grace to affordability, rates are still fairly high, keeping the cost of a mortgage out of reach for many,"" Bachaud said.

Those hesitant to re-enter the market may face slightly higher mortgage rates in the near term.

Both inflation and unemployment readings came in higher than expected in December ‚Äî indicating that the Federal Reserve may hold off on cutting interest rates. According to Realtor.com chief economist Danielle Hale, that could keep mortgage rates ""higher for longer,"" potentially causing rates to increase over the next few weeks.

The annual inflation rate increased to 3.4%, its highest reading since the 3.7% observed in September. According to the government report, shelter inflation including housing and rent costs continued to be a large influence.

While shelter costs fell from a high of 8.2% in March of last year, they were still up 6.2% year over year in December. According to Realtor.com, shelter costs need to fall to 3.5% in order for inflation to come on target.

‚Äú[Elevated rates] will curb total demand, as otherwise would-be buyers look for housing opportunities elsewhere, like single-family rentals,‚Äù Bachaud said.


**'Buyers aren‚Äôt likely to see price cuts'**

As competition picks up, those waiting around on the sidelines may miss out on opportunities to negotiate a price reduction.

According to Zillow, the share of listings with a price cut in December was just under 16% ‚Äî the lowest since April 2022.

""Sellers are holding firm on prices, likely thanks to the slower pace of price growth helping sellers (and buyers) know what to expect when it comes to setting a price,"" Bachaud said. ""Price cuts are never popular in the winter.""

Despite an influx of new listings this past month, the overall shortage of inventory was once again to blame for waning price cuts.

Newly listed homes in December were 9% above 2022 levels as sellers showed up in larger numbers, Realtor.com found, marking a second month of increased listing activity after a 17-month streak of decline.

""Competition is complicated. As rates go down there will be more buyer activity but because there has been such little inventory and since homeowners have been waiting, how much will this motivate sellers to go to market?"" Scott Driscoll, Boston-based Redfin premier agent, told Yahoo Finance. ""I do think there will be a lot more activity from sellers.""

Still, active inventory in December remained 36% below typical 2017 to 2019 levels. That‚Äôs kept home prices propped up, Realtor.com noted. While the national median list price declined seasonally to $410,000 last month, prices were growing 1.2% compared to a year earlier.

‚Äã‚Äã""Competition in the market today is a bit stronger than pre-pandemic norms. Although high costs have pushed a lot of first-time buyers to the sidelines, there are also far fewer choices,"" Bachaud said. ""Buyers aren‚Äôt likely to see a lot of price cuts, and should expect some opposing bids for the most attractive listings.""

**‚ÄòNew homes provide options for hungry buyers‚Äô**

Some of the pressure in buyer demand could be soothed by new construction.

Single-family home construction surged in November after declining mortgage rates helped relieve some affordability concerns. Overall, housing starts increased to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.56 million units, according to the US Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Census Bureau.

Should that rate continue to trend lower, that could provide a boost to new construction, noted the National Association of Home Builders.

""Unless we see new homes starts rise to 2 million homes per year, the seller's market will remain strong,"" Sharon said.

Homebuilders reported more confidence, as lower rates have also attracted more buyers back to the market. With the share of previously owned homes on the market still low ‚Äî builders can still get away with offering incentives for prospective buyers.

In December, 36% of builders said they offered a price cut averaging 6%. Meanwhile, 60% of builders offered sales incentives of all types, the same as November, but slightly down from 62% in October.

""New construction will continue to play an important role in bringing more options to the market,"" Bachaud said. ""As rates cool off from their peak, homebuilders are more optimistic about the future, increasing the number of projects they are starting this winter. Hopefully those starts translate into more new homes hitting the market to cool competition and provide more options for hungry buyers.""",2024-01-14,0

A top Federal Reserve official wants the Federal Open Market Committee to start thinking about slowing down its balance sheet reduction.

Lorie Logan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, discussed the Fed's effort to shrink its holdings during a public speech on Saturday, noting that the Fed's current pace of reduction ‚Äî $95 billion of securities a month ‚Äî is roughly double the pace of its previous tightening cycle in 2019. 

Logan said the quantitative tightening, or QT, process has been smooth so far, but has benefited from other developments that have caused usage of the Fed's overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility, or ON RRP, to dwindle faster than the runoff. Because of this, reserves ‚Äî funds held by banks at the Fed ‚Äî have not only been protected from mechanical destruction, but have instead been able to increase in recent months. 

""So, given the rapid decline of the ON RRP, I think it's appropriate to consider the parameters that will guide a decision to slow the runoff of our assets,"" she said. ""In my view, we should slow the pace of runoff as ON RRP balances approach a low level.""

Logan pointed to recent fluctuations in the Secured Overnight Funding Rate, or SOFR ‚Äî an interest rate benchmark derived from spreads in overnight repurchase activity in Treasury securities ‚Äî as a sign that reserves may be becoming scarce for some banks. 

While SOFR rates typically come in higher than the ON RRP rate, the spread between the two widened noticeably at the end of November and again at the end of December, by roughly one-tenth of a percentage point ‚Äî indicating a slight uptick in borrowing demand by banks. This type of movement is not out of the ordinary, as banks often adjust their books at the end of months, quarters and years. But such spreads were smaller and less frequent during earlier stages of the QT process, according to Fed data.

""The emergence of typical month-end pressures suggests we're no longer in a regime where liquidity is super abundant and always in excess supply for everyone,"" Logan said in her remarks.

Before taking the top spot at the Dallas Fed in 2022, Logan oversaw the Fed's securities activities as the manager of the System Open Market Account during her tenure as vice president of the New York Fed. Her comments over the weekend echo concerns expressed by analysts who say the balance sheet wind-down could be happening faster than anticipated.

A slower approach to QT could have long-term benefits in normalizing the Fed's balance sheet, Logan said, by ""smoothing"" the redistribution of liquidity in the financial system and thus limiting the likelihood that the Fed would have to cut its reduction plan short.

The Fed reduces its balance sheet by allowing Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to mature without replacing them. This loss of assets is matched by falling government liabilities ‚Äî including reserves, ON RRP, the Treasury's general account and cash in circulation, among others. The Fed has shrunk its balance sheet by roughly $1.3 trillion since the summer of 2022 and plans to continue doing so until reserves are at just above ""ample"" ‚Äî a level at which banks can transact normally without feeling compelled to hoard reserves. 

Throughout the process, Fed officials have pointed to the ON RRP as a buffer against reserve scarcity. Little used since its creation in 2013, the facility ‚Äî which allows money market funds and other nonbank counterparties to get paid interest for parking assets at the Fed overnight ‚Äî ballooned in 2021, eventually rising to $2.5 trillion at the end of 2022. Logan and Fed Gov. Christopher Waller have argued that ON RRP usage equates to surplus liquidity in the financial system and should be able to return to effectively zero.

Since the start of the new year, ON RRP usage has hovered around $700 billion daily. Also, as Logan noted in her speech, a recent survey of senior financial officers indicates that most banks have more than the minimum amount of reserves they need to do business comfortably. Still, she cautioned that ON RRP usage and the amount of excess reserves are not a one-for-one measure and reserves are not distributed equally within the banking system. 

""While the current level of ON RRP balances provides comfort that liquidity is ample in aggregate, there will be more uncertainty about aggregate liquidity conditions as ON RRP balances approach zero,"" she said.",2024-01-14,0

The SEC charged Morgan Stanley with ‚Äúfailing to enforce its policies concerning the misuse of material non-public information related to block trades,‚Äù that agency said.  
  
Block trades typically involve large numbers of shares of a company‚Äôs stock in privately arranged transactions executed outside public markets.  
  
The SEC said the bank generated more than $100 million in illicit profits as a result of misconduct by Pawan Passi, the former head of the bank‚Äôs U.S equity syndicate desk.  
  
Passi, 40, has entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with federal prosecutors, subject to approval by a judge. If Passi complies with the terms of that deal and demonstrates good behavior, he will not be prosecuted, prosecutors said.  
  
Passi was ordered to pay a $250,000 civil penalty by the SEC.  
  
Passi admitted that ‚Äúfrom 2018 through August 2021, he promised sellers of certain equity blocks that Morgan Stanley would keep information concerning their potential sales confidential, knowing that he would disclose that information to buy-side investors and that those investors would use the information to trade in advance of the block sales,‚Äù according to prosecutors.

Right when coronavirus was getting 'better' I exited all my positions and invested my money pretty much in 3 companies, Amazon, Microsoft and Alibaba. (33% each)

around 60k in alibaba, at 185‚Ç¨

Theoretically a good stock, e-commerce in china is not bad, alibaba-cloud is a good thing, massive company, numbers looked good. I'd still say that it's a good stock, if only there was no CCP.

So, it's been going down for the last few years, we're currently at ~66‚Ç¨, it was already this low like 1-2 years ago, recovered, now down again. 66% down for me.

I'm not rich at all, where others bought a department or something I have my money in stocks, and a third of it is about to be wiped out possibly. Honestly I don't think alibaba is going anywhere but who knows what the CCP will do and if/when it will recover, to 120‚Ç¨ / 180‚Ç¨, who knows.

Meanwhile the spy and all other stocks im interested in are at their alltime-high, i'm not about to sell with 66% loss, invest in something else, only for the market to go down because thats's how it goes.

For the last 3 years I thought ""let's wait and see"", and, well, I'm not exactly thrilled. Yeah it's trading at 7 PE, if we get positive indicators it could go back to 120‚Ç¨ I guess, already did that 1 year ago.

The rental company noted the high cost of collision repairs and lower demand from consumers as the primary drivers for the EV divestment. Hertz, in turn, plans to use some of the income from those sales to purchase more new gas-powered vehicles.

The electric rental demand issue may have less to do with the cars themselves and more to do with the unique traits of EVs. An average renter is looking for a car that will get them around over the course of a trip rather than a compelling experience in that car. For those customers, the complexities of an EV may prove to be more of a frustration than a charm.

Renting a Tesla Model 3, for instance, comes with all the frustrations of the screen-heavy Tesla user interface without any of the time to get used to those adjustments that a buyer would have. Charging is an even bigger issue: Not only do consumers without EV experience who rent a Polestar 2 or a Tesla Model 3 have to figure out how to charge a car while on the road, they also have to figure out two completely different charging ecosystems depending on which car they get.

Even though Hertz plans to offload much of its electric fleet, the company says it ""will continue to execute its strategy around EV mobility and offer customers a wide selection of vehicles,"" according to the filing. Hertz says it will grow its charging infrastructure, work closer with electric car manufacturers to lower parts and labor costs, and continue to help educate customers about EVs.

Hertz currently lists 548 Tesla Model 3s and zero Polestar models on its direct sales website. The most affordable Teslas are currently selling for just over $20,000, but screenshots shared by Electrek on Wednesday suggest that other Model 3s have previously been listed for as low as $17,700 before a potential tax credit for used EVs.

1553,Critique the flaws in this trading strategy of using earnings reports,0,1955x31,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1955x31/critique_the_flaws_in_this_trading_strategy_of/,10,"The strategy is buying the stock of a company that will have an earnings report release in the morning. You buy the stock in pre-market at 9am. You then set a 2% stop loss. And finally, if the stop loss is not triggered, you sell it at 10am. These times are entirely arbitrarily chosen.

The strategy hinges on this hypothesis which may or may not be true: over the long-run, in the one hour period from 9am to 10am during the morning of a company's earnings release, there is a higher probability that the stock goes up in that period than down more than 2% (the stop loss). Why? Because of algorithms placing more buy orders during market open on an earnings day as opposed to other dates and times and not just algorithms but people in general. Even if the stock ends the day in the negatives, it could be that the period from 9am to 10am was positive and then it declines later in the day.

I am also aware that alternately, the stock could fluctuate between 9am to 10am leading to triggering the 2% stop loss before 10am, then ending up positive at 10am. So you effectively would have profited if you didn't have the stop loss which was triggered by bad luck. However, my hypothesis also assumes that this scenario is rare enough that the strategy would still work.

Obviously, I have no empirical data to back up that this hypothesis is true, it's just a hunch. I would love to have that data though and with enough work it's possible to accomplish.

Instead, all I have done is run some simulations to see what parameters are required for you to profit off of this strategy in the long run. Here is how the simulation was run:

**Variables:**

Stop loss %: 2% below purchase price at 9am

Probability of stop loss being triggered between 9am and 10am: 50% (arbitrarily chosen). This is the chance that the stop loss is triggered and includes the scenarios where the stop loss is triggered leading to a loss despite the stock ending up in the positive at 10am.

Average return if stop loss is not triggered: 1% (arbitrary)

Standard deviation of returns if stop loss is not triggered: 4% (arbitrary). With these two numbers, plugging it into a normal distribution, there is a 1.22% chance that a stock makes a 10% or higher return at 10am if you bought at 9am and didn't trigger the stop loss in between. I thought a 1.22% chance for a 10% or higher return was a reasonable assumption.

Commission: $10 USD for buy and sell

Starting Cash: $1000

**Steps in the simulation:**

1. Purchase the stock at 9am (subtract $5 commission). Cash is now $995
2. Generate random number between 0 and 1. If it is equal to or less than the probability of the stop loss being triggered then that means you triggered the stop loss and lost 2%. Subtract the commission of selling which is $5.
   1. Cash ends the day at $970.10
3. If you didn't trigger the stop loss, then generate a random number from the normal distribution with mean return of 1% and standard deviation of 4%. If the random return is 2% or below, regenerate a random number until it is not 2% or below. This is because if it were 2% or below then that would trigger the stop loss and at this stage we are assuming the stop loss was not triggered. Let's say the random return is 1.5%. Subtract $5 commission for selling.
   1. Cash is now $1010.00
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for 100 trials (each trial representing a different stock and day so like if you did this strategy on 100 different earnings days for 100 different stocks)

**Results:**

At the end of step 4 above, I calculated the return after the 100 days. Doing 100 days will count as 1 ""simulation"". I ran 100 simulations, so doing steps 1 - 4 100 times and calculated the average return at the end of doing the strategy for 100 days. Here are the results:

1. With the variables I mentioned above, the average return was -99.7% so not a very good strategy.
2. If we change the numbers to be more optimistic. For example, 2% stop loss, 20% chance of triggering the stop loss, 3% average return, 2% standard deviation of returns. In this extreme, the average return would be 351%. That's pretty crazy for doing 100 earnings report days. But, 20% chance of triggering the stop loss is pretty optimistic.
3. For a 50% chance of triggering the stop loss, what average return would we require to make a good profit? With an average return of 4.5% and standard deviation of 4%, after 1000 simulations, the average return at the end of the 100 days is 46% which is excellent. However, how realistic are these numbers? Probably not close to reality.
4. For an average return of 3.5%, standard deviation of 4%, and probability of triggering the stop loss of 40%, running 1000 simulations of the 100 days again, the average return at the end of the 100 days would be 64%
5. Changing the starting cash and stop loss % significantly affects the results too. With a starting cash of $1000, the $10 commission is a pretty large % of the cash you have and it's likelier that you hit $0 and lose. With $10,000 starting cash it's less likely you hit $0 and can withstand downturns during the 100 days to come out on top at the end of the simulation. If you change the stop loss from 2% to 1%, this drastically increases the chance that you will win. However, if you decrease the stop loss to 1% then the probability of triggering the stop loss prematurely increases too so there is a balance.
6. For example, with starting cash of $10,000, stop loss of 1%, stop loss probability of 50%, average return of 2%, standard deviation of returns of 4%, and running 1000 simulations, the final result is an average return of 52%.
7. Same parameters as #6 but with a probability of triggering the stop loss of 60% which means that on 60% of the days you will be losing 1% of your money, even with this you would make an average return of 11%.
8. With a starting cash $10,000, stop loss 1%, stop loss probability of 40%, average return 1%, standard deviation 2%, the average return at the end of the 100 days would be 12.6%. 

**Takeaways**

It is possible to collect enough data to find out the empirical answer to the variables above. You can find out historically, what the probability of triggering an X% stop loss between 9am and 10am on earnings days is. You can find out the average return and standard deviation. All of this is possible. You get the empirical numbers and plug them into the simulation, find the optimal stop loss % and then potentially this could be a very profitable strategy.",2024-01-12,0

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

The current President of Nintendo Shuntaro Furukawa is an experienced professional manager, he has rich experience in overseas operations and a strong financial background, the good successor of Kimishima Tatsumi, who led Nintendo at a difficult time. I think Kimishima has three material contributions to Nintendo, The first is the lead of Nintendo Switch, and published successfully. The second was to change Nintendo's competition plan and focus on product differences, which was called the new blue strategy. The Third is the most important, that was complete the company management generation change. He gave the right to Shuntaro as his success in Europe business and Switch released. And he promoted Shinya Takahashi, the talent of development team management and technology innovation, as the leader of EPD. Although Shigeru Miyamoto is still the leader of Nintendo game development, Nintendo has already formed a younger team including Koopa Troopa, Aonuma Eiji, and Nogami Hisashi.   
The new leader Shuntaro has new ideas on Nintendo development and thinks the IP international expansion is important. He accelerated Nintendo‚Äôs IP content development through more methods like mobile games, movies, and theme parks. This strategy succeeded after the Super Mario Movie brought good financial returns, and the short movie enhanced its game sales.   
Shigeru is a legendary game developer and still makes contributions to Nintendo, including IP content development. But I want to say more about Shinya, the current leader of EPD. Shinya is an experienced worker at Nintendo, joined in 1989. He was always responsible for Nintendo software development and focused on team coordination and development technologies innovation. He promoted 3D game content development and built a workable process of motion capture for Nintendo. I think Shuntaro and Shinya are good composites for Nintendo management, and in recent years Nintendo‚Äôs performance, including financial and share price, has proven that.  
The current marketing leader Satoru Shibata and hardware development manager Ko Shiota are experienced technicians, who can reinforce Nintendo‚Äôs overseas expansion and new console and parts development.  
In conclusion, Nintendo completed the management generation change in 2018, and it has a great management structure and rich human resource deposit. I think Shuntaro Furukawa and Shinya Takahashi can lead Nintendo better.",2024-01-12,0
1562,Why does USFR have such a higher yield than all other money market funds?,20,194kuu0,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/194kuu0/why_does_usfr_have_such_a_higher_yield_than_all/,13,"Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not complaining, I hold USFR myself, but I can‚Äôt understand how it pays currently net 5.43% (**after** 0.15% fees) yet VMRXX which has **lower fees** (0.1%), pays 5.29%, in the market of risk-free rates that‚Äôs a huge difference.

On paper, it's an amazing company. 100% Gross margin. 63% EBIT margin. 58.4% Net Margin (No debt).

Revenue CAGR over past 5 years: 47% (Not organic, multiple acquisitions but core product is ~30%)

EBIT Margin Expansion over past 5 years: 26.5 points

EPS CAGR 5 yrGrowth: 58.8%

No Debt. Massive dilution due to acquisition.

Foward P/E is roughly 21x. You could expect a 10 yr CAGR of ~20% organically. Margins continue to expand. Capex light as it creates games so the cost to add another customer is close to 0.

 Sounds like the perfect company right? What am I missing?

Off the top of my head, my main concerns other than poor future revenue growth/margin contraction are

 1) Shareholder value (or lack thereof). The company as aforementioned as no debt but acquires companies using shares. While this isn't technically ""terrible"", I'd prefer not to get diluted.

2) Sin stock- Gambling regulation could cripple the company. The market generally dislikes vices.

3)FX risk. The Swedish Krona has been weak and creates yet another risk for the stock.

4) OTC- While not necessarily bad liquidity, nowhere near as liquid/transparent as public companies on nasdaq/nyse. I really wanted to see a 10-K but of course, they don't have one.

1566,HIMS is undervalued and has a lot of potential,0,194ahz9,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/194ahz9/hims_is_undervalued_and_has_a_lot_of_potential/,41,"Fellow bag chasers,

HIMS has the potential to be a game-changer. This is professional financial advice. Kidding ! I'd just like to hear your thoughts and opinions on the stock.

Why I'm Bullish on HIMS:

1) The company is well-positioned for growth in the healthcare industry. HIMS operates a telehealth platform that connects consumers to healthcare professionals. It offers a range of health and wellness products and services on its mobile app.  
  
The reason it‚Äôs going to be huge is because it provides prescription medication on a recurring basis and ongoing care from healthcare providers. It‚Äôs the Amazon of healthcare. Most (70-80%) of doctor visits can be treated with prescription medication. HIMS allows clients to see doctors much faster and delivers their prescription to their homes. It‚Äôs cheaper, faster and more convenient than the traditional healthcare system. HIMS is going to disrupt pharmacies the same way Netflix disrupted Blockbuster.  
   
2) Strong product: HIMS boasts an impressive revenue growth of 52.6%, which proves their product is in high demand ‚Ä¶ and the demand keeps growing.  
  
3) Excellent balance sheet. No debt. Assets exceed liabilities.  
   
4) Currently undervalued : Considering HIMS solid performance, it remains undervalued compared to its peers. Simply Wall Street‚Äôs DCF Model has them 70% undervalued. This could be an excellent buying opportunity for investors looking to get in early on a potential breakout.  


Risks to consider :   


1) Competition. HIMS has no direct competitor. No one offers eConsultation and ePharmacy combined. Teledoc would be the closest thing to a direct competitor. That being said, Amazon is interested in delivering prescribed medication. Huge companies have a harder time with rapid innovation and competing is easier said than done, but one has to respect a player like Amazon.  
   
2) Share dilution (HIMS is currently unprofitable)

  
What are your thoughts on HIMS ? Is it a promising investment or not ?

Tata Starbucks, a joint venture between Starbucks and Tata Consumer Products, plans to operate 1,000 cafes in India, the company announced yesterday (Jan. 8).

Starbucks currently has 390 stores across India. To meet the new lofty goal, the coffee chain will need to execute one new store opening every three days, CEO Laxman Narasimhan said during a visit to India.

It sounds like a herculean task ‚Äî but it‚Äôs only a little bit more of a push than what Starbucks has already been doing. ‚ÄúWe have opened one store every five days,‚Äù Narasimhan said in a CNBC interview published today (Jan. 9).

Starbucks needs the push now more than ever. A win in India is especially crucial after China relegated the US-based coffee giant to the No. 2 spot there, behind the homegrown Luckin Coffee.

# Introduction:

Ubisoft has been the fortunate party to be on the benefiting end of the Microsoft-Activision merger. Essentially receiving the catalog of ATVI's IPs including new releases up till 2038 to add on to their subscription service Ubisoft+. However, complaints of the lack of originality of new releases from UBI, delayed/canceled releases of games, and a subscription service that is priced too high for the value it provides are all issues that UBI faces. It seems that new releases are re-modeled replicas of the previous release. Ubisoft is starting to become less like a video game developer and more like a video game factory assembly line.

# Revenue:

Overall, for forecasting revenue I took into account that UBI has many of their highly anticipated mobile titles such as ‚ÄúRainbow Six Siege Mobile‚Äù and ‚ÄúTom Clancy The Division‚Äù being released in 2024, this is a strong step into the large mobile market for UBI. I ran 3 possible scenarios 1) UBI continues growing their player base Y/Y 2) UBI hemorrhages players somewhere in my forecast, and the ones that stick around are the players that are subscribed to Ubisoft+ 3) Market Scenario, the scenario that the market expects.

***SCENARIO 1***

\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/MSvHt3W)\]

For scenario 1, I assumed that the player count would continuously grow.   
When forecasting the number of active players, I assumed there would be a spike in player count for the first half of my forecast before tapering off as UBI acquires a significant portion of their most eager customers.  
When forecasting Revenue/Active Players, I believe that a significant portion of active players will come from the purchase of Ubisoft+. So I assumed that the revenue/active players would experience significant growth in the first half of my forecast before tapering off as customers purchasing Ubisoft+ may just be trying it out or may end up not like the Ubisoft+ service.

Ubisoft would be priced at $202.75 per share for Scenario 1.

&#x200B;

***SCENARIO 2***

\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/undCbK0)\]

For scenario 2, I assumed that the player count would grow for the first half of my forecast before facing a slight decline.  


When forecasting the number of active players, I assumed there would be a spike in player count for the first half of my forecast as UBI rolls out ATVI's IPs and their anticipated mobile IPs. Before it begins to hemorrhage to reflect that certain customers are just trying out Ubisoft's IPs.

When forecasting Revenue/Active Players, I assumed that the revenue/active players would experience meager growth in the first half of my forecast before tapering off.

Ubisoft would be priced at $187.06 per share for Scenario 2.

&#x200B;

***MARKET SCENARIO***

\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/dXaL0mP)\]

For the Market Scenario, the player count and average revenue/active player continuously declined.

The market expects Active Player count to decline from 133M to 27M reflecting a growing negative sentiment around Ubisoft's new IPs and they are mainly propped by a few notable IPs that are strongly supported by a small loyal fanbase. It also shows how little faith the market has in UBI given its negative history of canceling releases, not hitting forecasts, and poor plans made by management. 

# Cost:

When forecasting cost, I took into account that UBI believes AI can be used in areas such as developing NPCs or making maps more interactive. There are 4 main costs that UBI faces Cost of Goods Sold, R&D and Marketing, and SG&A.  
  
When forecasting the Cost of Goods Sold, I assumed that it tended downwards as AI gets more involved in the development process reducing the total number of developers needed to make a game.   
  
When forecasting R&D, SG&A, and Marketing, opting for less granularity I assumed that they would follow historic trends and took the historic average.  
  


# WACC:

France has a bond rating of ‚ÄúAA-‚Äù  
AA Risk Spread (1M Avg) = 0.58%  
France 10Y Treasury Bond yield (1M Avg)  3.24%   
RFR = 2.66%  
  
Stable Market ERP ([SOURCE](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/datasets/ctryprem.xlsx)) = 4.60%  
France ERP = 5.18%  
Beta ([SOURCE](https://www.infrontanalytics.com/fe-EN/30289EF/Ubisoft-Entertainment-SA/Beta)) = 0.54%  
COE = 5.46%  
  
UBI has no bond rating so I took a look at synthetic rating. ([SOURCE](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/ratings.html))  
FY22 operating profit was negative so I used FY21‚Äôs interest coverage ratio instead.  
FY21 Interest Coverage Ratio = 14.3x  
Based on Synthetic Rating UBI should be rated ‚ÄúAAA‚Äù. However, a company cannot be more stable than the government in the country they reside in. So UBI is rated ‚ÄúAA‚Äù  
AA Bond Yield (1M Avg) = 4.88%  
France Marginal Tax Rate = 25.00%  
COD = 3.66%  
  
Stock Price (5D Avg) = $22.75  
Shares O/S = 121.15M  
Market Value of Equity = 2756.16M  
As UBI doesn‚Äôt break down their ‚ÄúBank Borrowings‚Äù by duration other than <1 Year or >1 Year I assumed that >1 Year meant <6 Years.  
Weighted average maturity = 4 Years.  
FY22 Interest Expense = 36.00M  
Market Value of Debt = 1947.89M  
%Debt = 41.4%  
%Equity = 58.6%  
WACC = 4.71%  


# Conclusion:

Ultimately, I believe that the large market pessimism surrounding UBI can be attributed to its unreliable release date and consistently negative performance in the past few years. These factors create a lot of uncertainty around UBI on whether or not they can fully utilize their IPs. I believe that UBI's plans into the mobile market was a good move as the mobile market has very large untapped potential. But, considering the current trending titles on the mobile market, UBI's mobile entrants do not fit that bill. UBI has to reconsider its current IPs and allow innovation rather than releasing games that feel similar to each other or bump up its efforts in creating new IPs.

1576,Bitcoin ETF Approvals Are Bad for MicroStrategy,93,1941aun,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1941aun/bitcoin_etf_approvals_are_bad_for_microstrategy/,114,"Microstrategy is an inefficient structure for Bitcoin ownership.  Bitcoin gains are taxed as capital gains and can get long-term capital gains treatment if owned by an individual through an ETF.  MSTR is a C corp and must pay income tax on realized Bitcoin gains.  They must repurchase shares or pay dividends to return that capital to a shareholder.  At the top marginal tax rate, an incremental $1 of bitcoin gains through MSTR is worth $.63 to a shareholder.  Using a Bitcoin ETF in a normal account, an incremental $1 of gains is worth $.80.  In a tax-advantaged account, the gain could be worth up to $.79 through MSTR and $1 in an ETF.  It doesn‚Äôt matter if they don‚Äôt plan to sell the Bitcoin.  The government has a claim on the gains; Bitcoin with an unrealized gain through a C corp will always be worth less to an investor.

Some claim MSTR is a profitable software company that can plow its earnings back into more Bitcoin, which is valuable.  While there might be a benefit here, one doesn‚Äôt need to consider it.  On an LTM basis, MSTR has not generated operating cash flows in excess of stock compensation for 7 quarters.  LTM operating cash has been negative for three quarters, even with stock compensation.  MSTR can currently only use equity offerings and debt issuance to add more coins.

|Report date|9/22|12/22|3/23|6/23|9/23|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|LTM Stock Comp ($M)|59.7|63.6|66.8|67.0|66.9|
|LTM Op CF ($M)|24.7|3.2|(3.1)|(0.7)|(6.7)|

In light ETF approvals, MSTR has lost its luster.  It used to be a quirky vehicle through which one could get BTC exposure in public markets.  Now, it has all the tax disadvantages of a C-corp and the liquidity issues of the Grayscale Trust.  There are better ways to get Bitcoin exposure now; MSTR‚Äôs experiment is obsolete.

MSTR is also less liquid than an ETF.  ETFs have authorized participants that use arbitrage to ensure the market price reflects the value of the underlying assets.  MSTR cannot do this efficiently.  If shares were to fall below NAV, the best method of establishing price/value parity would be repurchasing shares.  As previously mentioned, MSTR‚Äôs software business does not generate sufficient cash flows to do this.  They would need to sell assets, potentially realizing gains.

The title may be a touch misleading at first, while they do talk about a Canadian specific financial stuff such as TFSA's ,RRSP's, Canadian real estate ect, the vast majority of the show is based around equities. They do talk about some (very good) Canadian companies, but more so US equities, a bit of crypto ect. They get guest on the show from time to time that have some awesome hot takes.

I would love to hear what podcasts you guys are into. As long as it's not motley fool, or mad money lol.  That shit is trash.

Edit: damn, tons of feed back. Looks like I have a lot of podcast to check out. 

I was planning on checking out a few podcasts on my way down to Edmonton. I started off with acquired. Listened to the episode on visa. This podcast blew me away. It's impressive  how they made a 4.5 hours long podcast that kept me intrigued the entire time. Brilliant stuff. Due to the length, this was the only one I have been able to look into so far, but I will definitely dredge my way through the recommendation.

Thanks for all the great content suggestions! ",2024-01-11,0
1584,Nintendo Anysis_2 Comparison,3,193rji9,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/193rji9/nintendo_anysis_2_comparison/,4,"Sorry, I can't upload pictures here.

**Growth**  
Nintendo 3 years average growth is 7%, and EPS growth is 20%. The revenue growth is lower compared with its peers, like Play Station and Xbox. The EPS growth is good, but not outstanding, lower than game developers Capcom, Koei Tecmo, and Square Enix. Koei Tecmo and Capcom have delivered impressive growth in the last three years. Play Station and Take-Two achieved high revenue growth but did not drive their profit increase.  
From the growth data comparison, I think Nintendo needs new drivers for the next generation. It plans to increase capital investment in IP expansion and initiate more people access to its dedicated game platform, but I think it not be the main driver in the next competition.  
**Profit**  
Nintendo has good profit margins with a gross margin of 55% and an operating margin of 32%. This is higher than most competitors. Koei Tecmo and Capcom are more attractive, but they don't have a platform. Compared with Sony Play Station and Sega, Nintendo's performance is better. I can't find the margin data of the Gaming business from Microsoft's financial report, so I use the personal segment data, maybe this is not exact.  
Although Nintendo has a decline in cash turnover compared with its history, Nintendo did much better than its competitors. Considering its good margins, I think Nintendo has strong profitability and return.  
**Returns**  
Nintendo has an outstanding investment return of 46% and an equity return of 21% compared with its competitors, especially in investment return. I think this benefited from a great composite of solid margins and a high cash turnover rate.  
Again, I use the company's whole business ROE of Microsoft as I can't get the gaming sector number to calculate it. Considering Microsoft's main business is office software and cloud, this ROE number may not be comparable. ROIC is re-calculated by gaming sector data, and so is Sony Gaming & Network business, Nintendo is performing much better in ROIC than Microsoft Xbox and Sony Play Station.   
**Capital Structure**  
All game companies here have low financial leverage with a leverage ratio below 0.5 except Sony. Nintendo has no debt on the balance sheet and strong solvency ability.   
Every company's Debt to EBITDA is below 4, which means their financial is health and has no insolvency risk.  
**Valuation & Dividend**  
Nintendo has a better valuation compared with its main competitors, after the recent soaring of price, Nintendo's current EV/EBIT is 13.68x, it's a little higher than the median line of 13x. I think Nintendo's valuation is not expensive considering its current solid financial performance in the first half of FY2023 and the potential to open another growth cycle through new console releases.  
As a potential new Switch release this year, we can see some clues from its data in history. Nintendo's EV/EBIT was 15.03x and 30.8x in 2006 and 2016, which is the year the new console was released. Of course, I assume Nintendo's next Switch will perform like Wii and Switch, not Wii U. After the new console is released, Nintendo's market cap increased by 2.5x and 1x in the following 2 years, its EV/EBIT is stable and declined little compared with the released year, which means Nintendo delivers rich profit returns after the new console is released. Back today, Nintendo's valuation multiple is lower than in history, but its market role is still strong, and financial performance is solid, this is not a very high risk to bet its good returns on the eve of a new Switch release.  
Nintendo has a good dividend payout ratio of around 50% compared with peers, which will define Nintendo as a value stock. I think Nintendo is not very attractive for buy-and-hold investors as it has highly volatile growth and market value, but it's a special opportunity you should consider when it prepares to add fuel to its tank, and you already know it's not too expensive, and has a stable dividend payout.  
**Big Three Comparison**  
As a game company with hardware and software, Nintendo's main competitors are Sony's Play Station and Microsoft's Xbox. To compare more clearly, I searched some data focusing on the three companies and their gaming business operating results, this can help me get a clear picture to understand the market position of the three companies. As Microsoft's gaming business data is not disclosed too much, the comparison focuses on Sony and Nintendo. All data used from the last quarterly financial report.  
From growth data, Play Station has the highest revenue growth but the lowest profit growth, while Nintendo has the highest profit growth and moderates revenue growth. Microsoft has the lowest revenue growth and higher profit growth. I think all three companies perform well, but I prefer Nintendo because it balances well in revenue and profit growth, you can see more growth in revenue can drive higher profit growth. Xbox X & S has bad sales compared with Switch and PS5. Microsoft may release its new console this year and maybe increase some market shares, especially after it acquired Activision Blizzard. But I don't believe this can change the market structure. Maybe Microsoft has another idea to get money from gaming competition, providing cloud technologies and promoting cloud gaming development. You know, Nintendo online playing uses cloud services from Azure.  
Play station's revenue was boosted by PS5 sales. Sony finally prepared enough stock to sell in the shop, you can find PS5 in every gaming shop and Costco. Sony's G & N business doing well this year, but its margin is too low compared with the other two. Sony has tonnes of popular IPs and first-party studios, I think it can do better in the gaming market and up its margin.  
Moving to hardware and software sales data, Sony has the highest volume sold in console and software which is driven by PS5. Nintendo achieved surprising console sold and solid software titles sold, but I think Switch volume growth will not persist, and Nintendo needs to prepare something to compete with PS5 and the new Xbox. Microsoft's Xbox X & S has walked to the end of its life as the lowest console sold compared with others. I hope to see its new Xbox this year.  
For Player and platform member data, Xbox has more active users but I think this is surpassed by Play Station as Sony has said its active users achieved 123m in its CES two days later. Sony currently has bigger subscribers compared with Nintendo Online and Microsoft GPX. Nintendo has 38m subscribers, which is in the middle.   
The cumulative console sold data tells me Nintendo is the biggest one in the market, but considering the Switch is a very old console, I decided to add PS4 and Xbox ONE back, after adding, Sony is the biggest one with a total of 157m units sold, and Nintendo is 132m sold, Xbox is still the lowest units sold of 77.6m. The video game market is still dominated by Sony and Nintendo.  
**Conclusion**  
Nintendo is doing well compared with its competitors with high-quality growth, strong margins, turnover and investment return, lower insolvency risk, and fair valuation. But Nintendo's growth is already showing signs of weakness, and I think the recent growth in Switch is driven by Legend of Zelda Tears of Kingdom. This trend will not persist in the next year without new console or titles, especially at the time the PS5 Slim has been released and the new Xbox coming. Sony and Nintendo have dominated the video gaming world, and from market shares, Sony is even better than Nintendo. But Sony Play Station's low profitability is putting it in the shadow of Nintendo.

They have a pledge to reach net zero emissions by 2038. They plan to sell 100% electric vehicles by 2030 in Europe and 50% in the US. They are also looking into hydrogen fuel cells and intelligent vehicles. Recently plenty of hedge funds have increased their position in STLAM. Over the last month, the stock has performed more bullishly than 97% of stocks, higher than 98% in its industry. It also has a nice 6.6% dividend and a Zack's rank of 3.

In terms of the stock, it is currently trading at $26.81. Its 1-yr target price (via yahoo and tipranks) is at $32.25. Alphaspread has its intrinsic value and dcf value well above its trading price as well, both at around $43. Overall, most analysts have it as a moderate-to-strong buy. Other reasons to look at it is its eps growth compared to the industry average, at 8.1% vs -14.6% predicted for this year (it has also outperformed historically if that counts for anything). It's free cash flow has also increased at a rate of 24.3% over the last 3-5 years compared to the industry's -.8%.

If I know the symbol of an F share, is there a way I can know exactly which foreign underlying security the F share represents? By ""exactly"", I mean country/exchange/ticker information or even the ISIN of the underlying.

For example, I happen to know that RBGPF is the F share of the London Stock Exchange listing of Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc. (LSE symbol: RB, ISIN: GB00B24CGK77), but that is only because there is lots of information about this company around the internet. If I am looking at the F share of a thinly-traded and obscure security, it may be difficult to conclusively determine what the underlying security is, especially when the issuer also has multiple share classes, preferred stock issues, exchange-traded warrants, or rights issues. Previously, I used FINRA's [OTC Daily List](https://money.stackexchange.com/q/137969) to find the underlying securities, but not all F shares are on the list (probably because some of those F shares were created decades ago).

In other words, is there a central regulatory authority that registers F shares? If so, are the registration documents publicly available? If so, where can I obtain those documents?

The world's largest contract chipmaker, whose customers include Apple (AAPL.O) and Nvidia (NVDA.O), has benefited from a boom in artificial intelligence applications that has helped it weather the tapering off of pandemic-led demand.  
Revenue in the final three months of last year came in at T$625.5 billion ($20.10 billion), according to Reuters calculations, compared with $19.93 billion in the year-ago period.

That beat Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co's (TSMC) previous prediction for fourth-quarter revenue being in a range of between $18.8-19.6 billion, and also beat an LSEG SmartEstimate of T$617.1 billion drawn from 21 analysts.

1590,Wondering about ethical investing,0,193goz9,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/193goz9/wondering_about_ethical_investing/,75,"Hello everyone 

I started investing a few years ago and made really great returns 20-40% a year. Which is amazing.

But, further research led me to know these companies practice what i consider to be unethical.

What's not ethical?

Wages below founding countries minimum/adjusted for other equivalence in other countries. No slave labor or slave gathering of resources. Aka Apple

Killing of innocent. Animals or people. ( Ethical farming is fine, even the slaughting of animals im referring to factory farming or arms companies. Id say even hunting weapons are fine ) 

Fucking up environment. Water sources, air, etc

Fucked up working conditions

The only thing that comes to mind is building your own ethical company, reits in a country with high standards or potentially bitcoin.

I dont care that people use money for drugs. Tobacco is fine, we're adults who make our own decisions. I think making someone harvest your tobacco for a dollar an hour is unethical, though.

All currency is used for crime. I do wonder about the environmental impact on crypto vs like physical gold mining. 

Basically, it feels like im stealing other people hard worked underpaid hours so i can retire earlier.

When the reality is i didn't choose to be born in Canada, this is complete luck. Just as the chinese man didn't choose to be born there, it was just complete luck.

So is it ethical to steal his hard earned wages so i can retire early?

Any thoughts and words are appreciated.

1603,Home price gains are surging from a decline in mortgage rates.,192,192rw11,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/192rw11/home_price_gains_are_surging_from_a_decline_in/,179,"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/09/home-prices-surge-detroit-gains-beat-miami.html

* Home prices are rising faster and faster each month, fueled by a decline in mortgage rates.
* States in the Northeast led the gains, with Rhode Island (11.6%), Connecticut (10.6%) and New Jersey (10.5%) seeing the strongest growth. 
* Home prices are surging ‚Äî and Detroit gained the most in November, beating Miami for the first time
* Home prices jumped 5.2% on an annual basis in November.
* Detroit saw the largest annual price gain, surpassing Miami.


On a national level, home prices jumped 5.2% in November compared to the same month a year earlier, according to a new report from analytics firm CoreLogic. That‚Äôs up from a 4.7% annual gain in October.

States in the Northeast led the gains, with Rhode Island (11.6%), Connecticut (10.6%) and New Jersey (10.5%) seeing the strongest growth. Areas seeing year-over-year price declines in November were Idaho (-1.3%); Utah (-0.4%); and Washington, D.C. (-0.2%).

‚ÄúThis continued strength remains remarkable amid the nation‚Äôs affordability crunch but speaks to the pent-up demand that is driving home prices higher,‚Äù Selma Hepp, chief economist for CoreLogic, said in a release. ‚ÄúMarkets where the prolonged inventory shortage has been exacerbated by the lack of new homes for sale recorded notable price gains over the course of 2023,‚Äù she added.

The lower the mortgage rate, the greater the buying power for consumers. While prices are expected to soften slightly later next year, much of that will depend on supply. At current low supply levels and demand increasing due to lower mortgage rates, for now at least, prices have nowhere to go but up.

After hitting more than a dozen record lows in the first two years of the Covid-19 pandemic, mortgage rates began rising sharply in 2022 and hit a more than 20-year high in October last year. The average rate on the 30-year fixed loan briefly crossed over 8%. It has since fallen back and is now in the high 6% range.

**Detroit topples Miami**

On the city level, Detroit saw the largest annual price gain at 8.7%, surpassing Miami, which came in at 8.3%, according to CoreLogic. Miami had held the top spot for 16 months.

‚ÄúDetroit lagged appreciation during the pandemic so some of this was a catch up,‚Äù said Hepp. ‚ÄúOther Mid-west areas [are] seeing stronger appreciation because they‚Äôre more affordable.‚Äù

While the median price of a home in Detroit is still among the most affordable in the nation, the market is considered overvalued due to local income levels.

Roughly 82% of the nation‚Äôs 397 metropolitan housing markets surveyed by CoreLogic were considered overvalued. That means Detroit‚Äôs home prices are overly high compared with local household incomes. Notably, large cities considered ‚Äúnormal‚Äù in valuation were Boston; Chicago; Los Angeles; and Washington, D.C.

‚ÄúIt really depends on who is buying in the area, and we‚Äôve seen more higher income folks buying in those areas,‚Äù Hepp said.",2024-01-09,0

According to the suit, Spirit relies heavily on Boeing for orders and manufactures much of the aviation giant's jet fuselages.

The lawsuit is noteworthy because of its allegations of manufacturing problems, including a complaint from one Spirit employee who alleged an ""excessive amount of defects"" in an email to one of the company's executives.

1607,Analysis: Why solar is the best place to mark your money in 2024.,0,192of49,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/192of49/analysis_why_solar_is_the_best_place_to_mark_your/,44,"Disclosure: I am heavily invested (200k) in $TAN shares and calls and opened a position in December.  


  
Right now, $TAN is criminally undervalued with an aggregate P/E ratio of 11 in contrast to the S&P which is nearly 25 and QQQ which is 33. There are significant near, mid and long term tailwinds are it relates to the industry. I have a price target between $90 - $120 for TAN at the end of 2024 and beginning of 2025. One could pick an individual solar stock for higher upside (FSLR, SEDG, ENPH) but an ETF limits your downside risk.  
Short-term bull cases:  


  
\#1: The Fed has signaled that it will cut interest rates soon which is a massive driver for residential solar stocks, which are heavily influenced by borrowing. In other words, most people in purchasing a solar system for their home borrow money in order to do so. Lower interest rates = less expensive loans = more solar system purchases.  


  
\#2: The upcoming election. Biden is a big proponent of the solar industry and there are massive subsidies under this administration that could continue in the coming years. The younger generation (millennials and generation z) consistently ranks climate change and green energy as their most important voting points. Additionally, these generations are now of home-owning age (meaning more customers to purchase residential solar systems).  


  
\# 3: The war in the middle east. At this point it's pretty clear that the war in Israel and the surrounding Arab countries is escalating and the war in Ukraine might also be related, given the alliances between Russia & other major oil exporters. When the middle east has gotten in wars, what has it historically done? Cut oil production. Guess what is a major driver for solar investment? Oil prices.  


  
\# 4: There is currently an oversupply of solar materials as a result of elevated interest rates in the past couple of years. Solar producers have tightened up their productions lines as a result. When interest rates come down and other factors (such as increased oil costs as a result from # 3, and increased subsidies from # 2), I believe people will flood into solar as they have already done in the past. This means that the short term price of solar could increase, driving up company revenues and sales.  


  
Long-term bull cases:  
\# 1: The future of energy is green, and most people unilaterally accept or agree with this premise. Solar energy is by far the cheapest and fastest way to decarbonize our energy sources.  


  
\# 2: Solar materials are becoming cheaper, which opens up to a broader consumer base.  


  
\# 3: In the last decade the adoption of solar as a power source has grown annually at an average of 24% with no signs of slowing down in the longer term.  


  
\# 4: The growth of crypto mining (particularly bitcoin) has made solar farms crop up like toadstools after a hard rain. There are literally farms in western texas that exist ONLY to supply electricity for bitcoin mining rigs. Given the increases in bitcoin price -> more mining -> more solar purchases to fund mining operations.",2024-01-09,0

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

1621,Nintendo Analysis_1,6,19296f7,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/19296f7/nintendo_analysis_1/,8,"**Revenue & Profit Growth**  
The revenue growth of Nintendo is highly volatile depending on the new consoles and titles it released.  
Nintendo has two big revenue growth records in the past 23 years. The first was in 2007, Nintendo achieved big sales in Wii and NDS Lite with their software worldwide after it released them in 2006. Wii was a success in the 7th console competition as it attracted more people to convert to players and expanded the whole game market, especially Wii has a high-profit margin compared with Xbox360 and PS3. But after that, Nintendo lost the whole next-generation competition. Nintendo's revenue and profit declined from 2010 to 2017, because the sales were full for Wii and NDS, and the successor Wii U failed in competition with PlayStation 4. Nintendo was too conservative in products, and its share price crashed in those years.  
Nintendo released its new console Switch in 2017 and achieved big success in the market. Nintendo has had the highest revenue and profit growth in the past, but again, the growth only persists for 4 years, and the new OLED Switch cannot inject much fuel for Nintendo compared with PS5. Although the last half-year financial report showed Switch and its software still have growth in its seventh year, especially in software, benefitting the Zelda successor release and the hit Super Mario Movie, I think it's time to update the new console and open the next growth cycle.  
The other good thing is Nintendo's revenue and profit growth are high  
a positive relationship, which means its revenue growth can drive profit.   
From the growth data, we know we can invest in Nintendo when it releases new console and titles, but we don't know if the new console will succeed in the market. I hope Nintendo can bring us new fun in the future.  
**Revenue Quality**  
Nintendo's cash conversion rate is bad because most time the rate of operating cash flow to net income is below 1. And this ratio has been around 0.5 in the last 2 years. The reasons are an increase in inventory and profit, and gains in equity investment and foreign exchange. I know some of them are not regular things, but this conversion rate is not good for me.  
**Margins**  
Nintendo's profit profit-earning ability enhanced after Switch was released in 2017. Its gross margin climbed to 55% and its operating margin jumped to 31% in 2023, much higher than the average of the past 20 years.  
I think Nintendo's margin is volatile too, not like Bandai's stable expansion, its margins are high related to new consoles and titles released. I don't like much volatile margin for a company, which means its advantage is thin and weak.   
Nintendo finds a way to compete with Sony and Xbox. Not just the console's functionalities, it is the integration of console, IP, and games, and keep expanding user scale to enter their IP world. Of course, Nintendo has seen the fuel in the console and game sales through its IP expansion strategy.  
I still notice the total tiles sold in the Switch platform has declined from last year, even though it is a high number compared with years before COVID-19. Nintendo must think about new drivers for the next generation competition, although they want to break the rules of console life. I believe the Switch will perform well in its eighth year as a scale console sold and keep releasing new titles in 2024. I would like to see some news about the new console from Nintendo this year, not only from the player but also the investor.  
**Turnover**  
Nintendo has a good cash turnover rate which expresses its dominant role in game title issuing before 2010. But things changed after Sony and Microsoft entered this sector. Nintendo's cash and inventory turnover has declined in recent years, which is the second-highest level in its history. I think this is some affected by capex increase recently. Although this number is good for game developers, I would like to see more efficiency in cash use.  
**Asset & Capital Structure**  
After Nintendo's domination breakdown by Sony and Xbox, Nintendo's AR increased in the last ten years but declined recently, and inventory climbed in the Covid period, similar to peers.  
I think Nintendo's operating and fixed assets are stable with business and PPE will increase in the following years as the new R&D headquarters develops.  
As a Japanese company, Nintendo has very low financial leverage with strong solvency.  
**Returns & Valuation**  
Nintendo has had good investment returns in the past as most time its ROIC exceeds its WACC. Equity return is not outstanding, most times below 12%, but moved better in recent years, I think it's benefitted the Switch sale and IP expansion.   
Nintendo's return data is express cycle character too and decline slowly in the past 2 years. This is another signal of the need to refresh its product portfolio.  
Nintendo's valuation is good as its profit increased around 6x and the price has just increased 1.8x in the last seven years. I think Nintendo's price is fair, but maybe expensive after its price soared after the second-quarter results were released. 

  
**Conclusion**  
Nintendo is a great company with high innovation ability, evergreen IP, and an expanded client base. However, its financial result is highly volatile and relies on its console and title release. This makes Nintendo like a cycle stock. The Switch has given Nintendo the confidence to say no to the console life rule in this sector, and it achieved another strong sales half year. This is impressive but I am still concerned about some data, like declined equity returns and cash turnover, and its low cash conversion.   
As 2024 is the eighth year of Switch and many rumors about the Switch2 release plan, I think Nintendo has a high probability of opening a new growth tunnel if it new console is released this year. Maybe this is the right timing to build some positions and wait for that, compared to Wii, Switch's long life and good performance have decline many investment risks.",2024-01-09,0

**Original post:**

https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/08/united-airlines-737-max-9-inspections-turn-up-loose-bolts.html

United Airlines said Monday that it has found loose bolts on door plugs of several Boeing 737 Max 9 planes during inspections spurred when a panel of that type blew out during an Alaska Airlines flight at 16,000 feet last week.

The Federal Aviation Administration on Saturday grounded dozens of 737 Max 9s after the panel blew out midflight on Alaska Flight 1282, calling for inspections.

United has 79 of the Max 9 planes in its fleet and is the biggest operator of the jet model.

""Since we began preliminary inspections on Saturday, we have found instances that appear to relate to installation issues in the door plug ‚Äî for example, bolts that needed additional tightening,"" United said in a statement. ""These findings will be remedied by our Tech Ops team to safely return the aircraft to service.""

Plane manufacturer Boeing said earlier Monday it issued instructions to airlines to conduct the inspections of the Max 9s in their fleets. United had begun some preliminary inspection work in the past few days.

No one was seriously injured in the accident aboard the Alaska Airlines flight, though the blown-out panel produced a force so violent that some headrests and seatbacks were ripped from the cabin and the cockpit door was flung open, according to initial details of a federal safety investigation. No passengers were seated in the two seats next to the panel.

The National Transportation Safety Board said the accident would have been worse at cruising altitude when passengers and crews are walking around the cabin.

But the accident places fresh scrutiny on Boeing, which has spent years trying to clean up a host of quality defects, while also ramping up aircraft production, including of the 737 Max. CEO Dave Calhoun has spent months trying to assure airlines, investors and financial analysts that the company is improving its supply chain and working to resolve its quality problems.

Calhoun canceled a company leadership summit this week and plans to hold an all-employee call on Tuesday.

Alaska Airlines, which is set to inspect its fleet of more than 60 737 Max 9s, didn't immediately comment on whether it, too, has found loose bolts.

The FAA declined to comment on United's findings. Boeing didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

The 737 Max is Boeing's best-selling aircraft, with more than 4,000 orders to fill. However, the more common Max 8, which is not affected by the grounding, makes up the majority of those orders.

Aviation publication The Air Current first reported that United had discovered the loose bolts.",2024-01-08,0

1627,Offices Around America Hit a New Vacancy Record,79,191y0f6,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/191y0f6/offices_around_america_hit_a_new_vacancy_record/,22,"https://www.wsj.com/real-estate/commercial/offices-around-america-hit-a-new-vacancy-record-166d98a5

* A staggering 19.6% of office space in major U.S. cities wasn‚Äôt leased as of the fourth quarter, according to Moody‚Äôs Analytics, up from 18.8% a year earlier. That is slightly above the previous records of 19.3% set in 1986 and 1991 and the highest number since at least 1979, which is as far back as Moody‚Äôs data go.

America‚Äôs offices are emptier than at any point in at least four decades, reflecting years of overbuilding and shifting work habits that were accelerated by the pandemic.

The new record shows how remote work has upended the office market. But that is only part of the story. Much of the market‚Äôs current malaise traces its roots to the office-market downturn of the ‚Äô80s and ‚Äô90s.

That surge in office vacancies in the 1980s and early 1990s followed years of overbuilding. Easy lending fueled a construction boom, particularly in the South where land was cheap and red tape sparse. Banks often financed speculative office projects that didn‚Äôt have any tenants signed up.

‚ÄúThe building I built was almost a million square feet‚Äî100% empty,‚Äù said developer Bruce Eichner, who built the Manhattan office tower 1540 Broadway in the 1980s.

The result was a glut of office buildings that couldn‚Äôt find tenants when the economy went into recession in 1990 as the country suffered from the savings-and-loan crisis, when many S&Ls failed.

That glut weighs on the office market to this day and helps explain why vacancies are far higher in the U.S. than in Europe or Asia. Many office parks built in the 1980s and earlier struggle to find tenants as companies cut back on space or leave for more modern buildings.

‚ÄúThe bulk of the vacant space are buildings that were built in the 1950s, ‚Äô60s, ‚Äô70s and ‚Äô80s,‚Äù said Mary Ann Tighe, chief executive of the New York tri-state region at real-estate brokerage CBRE.

And just as in the early ‚Äô90s, it is the overbuilt South that is hit hardest. Today, the three major U.S. cities with the country‚Äôs highest office-vacancy rates are Houston, Dallas and Austin, Texas, according to Moody‚Äôs. In 1991, Palm Beach and Fort Lauderdale in Florida and San Antonio held those positions.

Companies, eager to cut costs, also began ditching spacious private offices for open floors and cubicles, meaning they needed less space per employee.

‚ÄúYou had a shift away from the ‚ÄòMad Men,‚Äô Don Draper era of some of these large, large offices,‚Äù said Thomas LaSalvia, head of commercial real-estate economics at Moody‚Äôs Analytics.

That helped push up vacancies and started a gradual shift toward smaller offices that continues to this day. The Covid-19 pandemic merely sped up the shift as companies realized they needed even less space per employee because of remote work.

For all the similarities, there are also important differences between the two downturns. The crisis of the early 1990s ended abruptly after the economy started booming again. Vacancies plummeted, and companies gobbled up space. This time, most analysts expect offices to stay emptier for longer because vacancies have less to do with economic cycles and more to do with the growing popularity of working from home. 

Meanwhile, winners and losers have switched places. In 1991, San Francisco had the country‚Äôs third-lowest office-vacancy rate, according to Moody‚Äôs. Today, the city has some of the country‚Äôs emptiest offices, partly because its large tech sector has enthusiastically embraced remote work.

Palm Beach and Fort Lauderdale had the highest vacancy rates among major U.S. markets in 1991. Today, they are among the lowest. Palm Beach‚Äôs vacancy rate fell from 28.8% in 1991 to 14.2% in 2023, the steepest drop among major markets. Fort Lauderdale saw the second-steepest drop during the period, from 28.1% to 18.9%.

West Palm Beach, Fla., had a ‚Äúgrowth spurt‚Äù in the 1980s as developers plastered the city with giant office buildings, said Kevin Probel, a senior managing director at real-estate brokerage JLL. It took a long time to fill all that space.

Today, the area is once again in the middle of an office-construction boom. Developers are building high-end, hurricane-proof offices with landscaped outdoor terraces and pickleball courts. But unlike the 1980s, West Palm Beach is now a destination for major finance companies seeking low taxes and warm weather.",2024-01-08,0

Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (‚ÄúRocket Lab‚Äù or ‚Äúthe Company‚Äù), a leading provider of space launch services and advanced satellite technology, today announced it has been selected by and is under contract with the Space Development Agency (SDA) to design and build 18 Tranche 2 Transport Layer-Beta Data Transport Satellites (T2TL - Beta).

Rocket Lab will act as prime contractor for the $515 million USD firm-fixed price agreement, leading the design, development, production, test, and operations of the satellites, including procurement and integration of the payload subsystems. The contract establishes Rocket Lab‚Äôs position as a leading satellite prime contractor, providing supply chain diversity to the Department of Defense (DoD) through vertical integration. The contract comprises $489 million base plus $26 million of incentives and options and will be carried out by Rocket Lab National Security (RLNS), the Company‚Äôs wholly owned subsidiary created to serve the unique needs of the U.S. defense and intelligence community and its allies.  
  
The SDA is procuring satellites in two-year ""tranches"" to build out a proliferated constellation in LEO to deliver needed space-based capabilities to the joint war fighter. The T2TL ‚Äì Beta satellites, part of the Tranche 2 program, will be integrated into SDA‚Äôs Transport Layer to provide assured, resilient, low-latency military data and connectivity worldwide to meet DoD needs.  
  
‚ÄúThis contract marks the beginning of Rocket Lab‚Äôs new era as a leading satellite prime. We‚Äôve methodically executed on our strategy of developing and acquiring experienced teams, advanced technology, manufacturing facilities, and a robust spacecraft supply chain to make this possible. It‚Äôs exciting to now be delivering this capability for government and commercial customers alike,‚Äù said Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Peter Beck. ‚ÄúSDA‚Äôs acquisition approach favors speed, schedule certainty, and affordability to deliver next-generation space capabilities to the nation. We‚Äôve proven Rocket Lab is capable of delivering this across our launch and spacecraft programs and we look forward to delivering it for SDA.‚Äù  
  
All 18 satellites will integrate subsystems and components built in-house by Rocket Lab, including solar panels, structures, star trackers, reaction wheels, radio, flight software, avionics, and launch dispenser. This high degree of vertical integration gives Rocket Lab a rare level of control over supply chain, enabling efficiencies and certainty on cost, schedule and quality. The satellites will be built at Rocket Lab‚Äôs advanced spacecraft development and manufacturing complex within the Company‚Äôs Long Beach headquarters. The facility includes a 12,000 sq. ft. cleanroom and 40,000 sq. ft. of streamlined production & test facilities designed to support constellation class manufacturing and satellite assembly, integration and test for commercial, civil and national security customers. The satellites are scheduled for launch in 2027.  
  
As a leading provider of advanced spacecraft and components, Rocket Lab has a backlog of more than 40 satellites in development and production. Rocket Lab satellite technology and components have been integrated into more than 1,700 satellite missions globally.",2024-01-08,0

On Friday, the National Association of Home Builders announced plans to seek $1.2 billion in government funding to boost U.S. transformer production.

It isn‚Äôt just transformers that are needed. Power lines are hard to source, too. ‚ÄúPrysmian 
[lead time] is about 50 weeks plus,‚Äù said Jason Huang, CEO at TS Conductor. TS is a start-up making higher-tech transmission wires designed to carry more juice.

Prysmian is one of the dominant producers of cables globally. Its backlog of orders sits at about $11 billion, up from about $2.3 billion at the end of 2019.

Those data points are three canaries in the coal mine‚Äîso to speak‚Äîsignaling that the U.S. isn‚Äôt quite ready to expand its electricity grid.

‚ÄúYou already have a tight supply situation,‚Äù added Huang, in an industry he said is poised to double its capital spending. The industry is ‚Äúnot even seeing that increase in your capex spending yet,‚Äù he said ‚ÄúThis is just today‚Äôs environment.‚Äù

Overall, electricity demand growth is projected to accelerate, thanks to EVs and everything else that is going electric. The Energy Department sees electricity generation capacity expanding at a rate of about 2.6% a year over the coming 20 years, about double the rate since 1990.

Electric utilities in the U.S. have spent roughly $135 billion a year on average for the past few years to maintain and increase their capacity. That number should be near $170 billion in a couple of years, according to the Edison Electric Institute.

Growth is something the industry has to gear up for. Transformers are manufactured by the likes of Eaton and Hubbell, but most of the business is repair and replacement of existing infrastructure, explained RBC analyst Deane Dray. There hasn‚Äôt been a lot of investment for growth.

The good news is that will change. Companies such as Eaton and Prysmian can make good money as the grid grows.

Their numbers have already started to improve. Prysmian earnings have risen at about 57% a year for the past three years‚Äîbetween 2020 to 2023, including fourth-quarter estimates. Eaton has grown earnings at about 29% a year on average for that period.

For Prysmian, Wall Street expects earnings to rise at about 5% a year for the coming three years, according to FactSet. Analysts project 9% average annual earnings growth at Eaton over that time.

Wall Street sees earnings growth decelerating at both, but that doesn‚Äôt mean the peak is in. Analysts are loath to assume that good times will last forever, so they tend to forecast what they see as normal results.",2024-01-08,0

So, this post could sound somewhat uninformed (because it is).

Now, Apple is worth $3T because of the price that its stock is trading at. That's the price that the people interested in buying Apple stock are willing to pay for it because they believe that's how much the company is worth. The same goes for every other asset like houses, gold, paintings, currencies etc. They're worth as much as people value them.

Now, when it comes to houses, I can understand why people value them; they can actually live in them and better houses provide for a greater standard of living. People have an incentive in buying houses other than the fact that their prices will go up. Gold also has aesthetic and scientific value. Paintings have aesthetic value. Currencies enable you to trade with countries that operate in them.

However, I don't fully understand why people value stocks and how buying stocks is different than buying worthless rocks.

What's the market's incentive in trying to get the market value of a company closely resemble its perceived value? Now, if dividends was the only motivation at buying stock - a better company generates higher profits in the long run and gives higher dividends - it would answer my question.

As a result they can cut costs like crazy. The only checking is done by the state board of pharmacies, which is nowhere as stringent and hence as expensive as FDA.   
Also they basically only have generics so that means they don't really 'invent' anything going through Phase 1, Phase 2 etc. and most conditions don't really need any medical research. And earlier US companies used to do most of the cutting edge medical research, but now all the research has moved to Europe. Pfizer has Biontech in Germany, J&J has Janssen in Swiss, Sanofi is in France mostly, I guess Moderna is the only one still in US but might also move soon.

Plus they're online, so they don't need to maintain expensive equipment equipment like freezers or even deal with theft. They can also share liability with the shipping companies like UPS , Fedex incase of spoilage, so in case a patient sues them they can involve the shipping partners.

Also compared to physical pharmacies they don't have to call the cops or do any verification of patients before sending the drugs (not sure about this), so there are labor cost savings

1662,Live Nation Entertainment (LYV) DCF Analysis,2,18zyl4u,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18zyl4u/live_nation_entertainment_lyv_dcf_analysis/,2,"**NOTE: NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE**

# Introduction:

LYV is involved in a huge chunk of the ticketing portion for events such as concerts, clubs, and parties. They are either the direct promoters for these events or offering their ticketing platforms to other parties. LYV manages to wrest and maintain its control over other ticketing companies globally as LYV enters into multi-year contracts with venues or outright owns these venues. Such anti-competitive behavior has been the subject of much scrutiny from consumers, artists, and the government. This legal uncertainty of whether LYV may get broken up is the main focal point for every discussion around LYV's Valuation.

For my forecast, LYV management believes 2019 is the norm ‚Äú2019 is the best comparison for us in terms of understanding our results.‚Äù - 2022 Q4 Earnings Conference.

# Revenue:

Overall, for revenue I took into account ‚Äúwe didn't promote the Taylor tour, so I don't have that comparable to worry about in '24. Beyonce was our tour, wildly successful. But when we look at any artists across Ticketmaster, Live Nation, no artist is going to account for more than 1% of the tickets. So no one tour will ever hurt us year-over-year.‚Äù - 2023 Q3 Earnings conference.  
  
When forecasting the Number of Events, Number of Fans, and Fans/Events, I considered that Y/Y 2021 and 2022 results were accelerated due to the poor comparable year of 2020 and the post-covid recovery revenge spending. I assumed this triple-digit Y/Y growth did not continue and the accelerated growth only goes on for 2 years before LYV switches back to organic growth.   
  
When forecasting revenue/fans taking into account the high potential for legislation action if LYV raises their prices too much I assumed only meager growth till the end of my forecasted period.  
  
When forecasting the total number of tickets sold and revenue/ticket, I assumed that the total number of tickets sold recovered at a similar trajectory as the events held by LYV.   
  
When forecasting advertising revenue, as this area is a relatively new area being reported there isn‚Äôt much information to use for my forecast. Opting for less granularity I assumed that the Y/Y growth rate would be halved before being tapered off into perpetuity.

# Cost:

Overall, when forecasting cost I took into account ‚ÄúI expect margin expansion of least 50 basis points relative to last year, so making good progress, verging on halfway back towards the 2019 levels.‚Äù - 2023 Q3 Earnings Conference.  
  
When forecasting COGS, as COGS is a highly variable cost ‚ÄúThese costs are primarily variable in nature.‚Äù - 2022 10-K. And given how COGS fluctuates very wildly with output as seen from FY20, I opted for less granularity and kept COGS as a % of historic averages.  
  
When forecasting SG&A, as LiveNation ramps up for the first 3 years of my forecast the SG&A as a % of revenue declines before tapering downwards.  
  
When forecasting Others, opting for less granularity I took Others as a % of historic averages.

# Change in NWC:

When forecasting Change in NWC, FY20 - FY21 is an inaccurate measure due to the restricted supply chain and covid restrictions. I took only the average for FY19 and FY22.

# WACC:

US has a bond rating of ‚ÄúAA+‚Äù  
AA+ Risk Spread (1M Avg) = 0.58%  
US 10Y T-Bond Yield (1M Avg) = 4.14%  
RFR = 3.56%  
Beta ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LYV/)) = 1.29  
4050 = (4050 \* 4.25%) \* (1+16%) / (1+R) + \[((4050 \* 4.25%) \* (1+16%)) \* (1+3.82%) / (R - 3.82%)\] / (1 + R) \^ 2   
R = 10.30%, ERP = 6.74%  
COE = 12.25%  
  
LVY has a bond rating of ‚ÄúBB-‚Äù ([SOURCE](https://cbonds.com/news/2363459/))  
BB- Risk Spread (1M Avg) = 2.33%  
Marginal Tax Rate = 21.00%  
AT-COD = 4.65%  
  
Market Price (5D Avg) = 91.36  
Total shares outstanding = 231.59M  
Market Value of Equity = 21158.06M  
Given that only the 2022 10-K was released, assumed that 2023 debt was refinanced and lumped together with <1 Year.  
Weighted Average Maturity = 3 Years.  
2022 Interest Expense = 278.48M  
Market Value of Debt = 5959.31M  
%Debt = 21.98%  
%Equity = 78.02%  
%WACC = 10.58%

# Conclusion:

Ultimately, in my base case I value LYV at $72.84 per share. I believe that the large legal uncertainty looming over LYV makes it a risky stock. The stronghold LYV has over the ticketing industry is undeniable, however, this stronghold is a double-edged sword that could add more risk to the overall company.

-Their charts aren't the best but they're okay, it's fluid, fast, intuitive and make sense to a huge genz population
-They have 24 hour trading on quite a few stocks
-The Robinhood gold actually gives you 5% interest rn or even more and also a lot of insights about a company (it set apples price target to 160$ almost 5-6months ago)
-The app is fun to use, and for someone new it's quite intuitive, the way they have the options UI makes sense to me 
-They also have a bunch of IRA stuff and stock lending (which I haven't explored)

Their equivalent in India called Zerodha is one of the biggest hits rn, so am surprised their American equivalent is so unrecognized.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Please forgive me in advance for my bad English and for probably not using the correct terms in this investment world.  
  
Let's imagine a hypothetical situation in which: I live in Europe (in fact, I'm moving to Spain this year btw) and I'm going to trade an ETF that follows the SP500, but is based in Europe and dollars ( to avoid suffering Forex fluctuations, which adds more variables to consider).  
  
Let's say this ETF happens to be the CSPX.L, which is based in the London Stock Exchange.  
  
This ETF starts trading at 8:00 am GMT, well before the SP500 opens in New York at 9:30 am EST.  
  
Just before the SP500 opens at 9:30 am EST in New York, you can still check the SP500 futures market. As we already know, the futures market almost always (right?) indicates whether the exchange/ETF will open rising or falling.  
  
Let's say that tomorrow at 09:20 am EST (which means 02:40 pm GMT) the SP500 (SPY) futures market is indicating that it's going up by, I don't know, about 0.2%. It's kind of obvious the SP500 will open the trading session going up, too, right?  
  
As I am based in Europe, I can buy the ETF CSPX.L (which, again, is based in London and follows the SP500) at exactly 02:20 pm GMT (09:20 EST), as the London Stock Exchange is already open, ahead of the SP500 opening time in New York and I could almost certainly make a gain as the SPY will rise as soon as it opens, as indicates the SPY futures market.  
  
Does this logic of mine make sense? Have traders already taken advantage of this?

This is why the Motley Fool has over a million paying subscribers, and 7 out of the top-10 finance publications in Substack offer stock picks or trade ideas.

Despite the ever-growing popularity of financial influencers, we know very little about the accuracy and quality of investment advice they provide. But, the latest research from the Swiss Finance Institute gives us interesting insights into the world of Finfluencers.

Based on the backtest of over 29,000 financial influencers on Twitter, researchers found that only 28% provide valuable investment advice (Monthly abnormal return of 2.6%), and 16% provide no value. 

The stunning yet not-so-surprising finding was that the majority (56%!) of financial influencers were giving harmful advice, and following it would have yielded a monthly abnormal return of -2.3%.

Equally concerning was that the most popular accounts (based on follower count) provided the worst advice, as they created overly optimistic beliefs when the times were good and overly pessimistic beliefs during the tough times. 

Ironically, a contrarian investment strategy that trades against the advice from these accounts yielded a 1.2% monthly abnormal return.

Finally, the less active financial influencers with fewer followers were among the most skilled. The lower follower count was predominantly due to their contrarian tweets. They don‚Äôt ride the momentum (both social media and the market) and make positive tweets after negative returns (or news) and negative tweets after positive returns.

On the other hand,

*finfluencers with more followers have a higher likelihood to be antiskilled. Antiskilled finfluencers ride return and social sentiment momentum. They make positive tweets after positive returns and negative tweets after negative returns.*

1689,Thoughts on ex-china ETFs,7,18yagwg,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18yagwg/thoughts_on_exchina_etfs/,17,"Hi

I sold a position (in KGH.wa if that matters) and want to reinvest it. I want to diversify my portfolio and want to invest in an ETF that tracks emerging markets but without China. While I like China, I feel it is not the right time to buy in there and most stocks in ETFs that include China have stocks that I am not confident in (like construction companies). So looking at ETFs without China, I came across the iShares MSCI EM ex-China UCITS ETF, trading at the Amsterdam stock exchange with ticker EXCH.AS

[https://www.ishares.com/nl/particuliere-belegger/nl/producten/315592/ishares-msci-em-ex-china-ucits-etf?switchLocale=y&siteEntryPassthrough=true](https://www.ishares.com/nl/particuliere-belegger/nl/producten/315592/ishares-msci-em-ex-china-ucits-etf?switchLocale=y&siteEntryPassthrough=true)

I am tempted to buy in for the following reasons:

1. Cheap entry point. A similar emerging market ETF but with China included trades at ‚Ç¨28. I prefer to buy larger numbers of cheap stocks than few of an expensive stock because the chances that a stock/ETF goes up 20 cent is bigger than going up 10 euro.. I'd rather have 1000 units of a $5 stock going up 20 cents than 1 unit of a $1000 stock go up 10 euro.
2. The second position in this ETF is another ETF (iShares Brazil). I believe in the Brazilian market so I don't mind having a large exposure to it. 
3. Also a good selection of Indian stocks

What's holding me back: 

1. Taiwanese stocks: while Taiwan is more transparent than mainland China, the hostilities can flare up. 
2. Russian stocks: they seem to be stuck with lots of Russian stocks valued at 0. On the other hand, if/when Russia returns to the world markets, those stocks could hold value again but I am unsure how to see this.

So: is this ETF worth it? Has anyone bought it?",2024-01-04,0

1694,The Current State of JPMorgan Chase and the banking sector,2,18y367t,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18y367t/the_current_state_of_jpmorgan_chase_and_the/,7,"Hello, friends. Let's talk about the immediate future of the biggest bank in America by total assets, JPMorgan Chase (ticker JPM).

&#x200B;

As we know, the banking sector took a beating in 2022 as inflation grew less and less transitory and people expected the Fed to raise interest rates. 2023 wasn't all sunshine and rainbows either but on 12/13/2023, following the rate-hike pause, the entire market shot up (especially fintech and banks).

&#x200B;

There isn't much news that's going to shake up the behemoth's fundamentals any time soon, but technically, it's definitely somewhere in the overbought zone in terms of indicators like MACD or RSI. SPY was in this position until the first day of the year, and it began to correct itself both market days thus far, while JPM went up the first day along with other banks, albeit slightly scathed today.

&#x200B;

I'm not expecting a massive correction, but I do see some reasons that could potentially trigger a small one:

(1) Jeffrey Epstein Document: I have no idea how this is going to unfold and it's probably a stretch but JPMC has a history of being involved and I remember the stock suffering because of the news. Doesn't seem like much of a factor, if that, but it doesn't help the market.

(2) Non-Farm Payrolls this Friday: I suspect the market will react negatively to this as the economy's feeling more and more of the interest rate hikes; A lot of people underestimate how long it takes for interest rate policy to take effect on the economy (not the market). Historically speaking, I would say anywhere from 6 months to 18 months. The market's already expecting a lower number, but I'm hoping people will realize the higher interest rate is starting to take its toll on the economy.

(3) Inflation Data next week: Inflation, as I observed, is more resistant to change the lower it is. I'm not doubting the analysts' forecasts but inflation has been cooling awfully fast this past year, which is great but I think the market is seeing inflation as too much of a linear entity (see below for reference). I'm hoping it comes hotter than expected, although I'm probably biased.

*Inflation rate in 2023 from Jan to Nov. (Source: https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/#:\~:text=The%20annual%20inflation%20rate%20for,ET.):*

*6.4	6.0	5.0	4.9	4.0	3.0	3.2	3.7	3.7	3.2	3.1*

&#x200B;

(4) Technical reasons: In additional to the technical reasons I stated above, JPM has pretty much hit its near-exact all-time-high price earlier today. I'm expecting a healthy pull-back and I think that could come in the form of either back-testing to other technical price/line like 200 EMA, or consolidating near that point. I'm hoping it won't consolidate because there's too much happening in the market, (it is the first week of the year after all) and it back tests instead.

&#x200B;

I'm neither an analyst nor an economist, so I don't know to what extent any of these will affect the market but I wanted hear others' insights on the matter :)

P.S. I am currently holding a small put position, but will likely be adding more.

>Lululemon's founder may feel like he left his wallet in the yoga studio, given the fortune he missed out on by selling shares in the apparel retailer. Chip Wilson owned 42 million shares, or about 29% of Lululemon in April 2013, regulatory filings show. The company's stock price was about $75 then, valuing his stake at $3.2 billion. Lululemon stock has surged by nearly seven-fold since then to north of $500 , but Wilson offloaded the bulk of his shares before it took off.

>Wilson more than halved his stake to 13% by April 2018, when Lululemon shares were still trading below $90. He pared the holding to its current level of about 10.7 million shares, or 8%, over the next two years during the stock more than doubled to about $220. The share price has soared by another 130% to record highs since then, leaving Lululemon worth more than $60 billion.

>All else being equal, if Wilson had retained his entire 29% stake, it would be worth about $21 billion ‚Äî nearly quadruple the $5.4 billion value of his remaining position. Forbes pegs Wilson's fortune at about $7 billion today, and estimates his net worth at over $20 billion if he'd retained all of his Lululemon shares. That amount of wealth would put him in the top 100 of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, among the likes of Indian steel titan Lakshmi Mittal ($20.3 billion) and Facebook cofounder Dustin Moskovitz ($19.7 billion). It's worth noting that Wilson stepped down from Lululemon's board in 2013 after making controversial comments. The stock might not have performed as well if he'd stayed and kept all of his shares.

I am a research analyst working at a Wall Street firm and I have always tried to make a meaning of my work despite the growing evidence that active investing will underperform passive 99% of the time over the long term. I realized that trading in the stock market seems to indicate a classic prisoner‚Äôs dilemma. 

Everyone in the financial world has heard of the ever growing ‚Äòpassive‚Äô investment strategy to just hold the market and you‚Äôll always perform at the average for the long-term. Yet professional analysts that have access to corporate C-suite executives for an information edge + dedicate their whole working lives can‚Äôt seem to beat the market over the long term. (KEYWORD LONG-TERM). There are some anomalies to this such as people who turn up their risk incredibly and yolo on a stock and end up getting lucky or business owners that become millionaires on their stock alone. But what I‚Äôm talking about is common risk-adjusted returns from a stock portfolio.   


When I first started as a research analyst, I couldn‚Äôt understand how working all day on company analysis and having such exclusive access to the investor relations team of stocks could end up yielding mediocre returns over the long term. Sure, we all see the news on this fund outperformed this year, and this one too, but no one looks at the 10, 20-year performance, everyone is focused on the short term and this and that PM having the ‚Äòmagic touch‚Äô. I then realized that the ‚Äòexclusive‚Äô access to companies isn‚Äôt that exclusive and they talk with many institutional investors ‚Äì and of course, the information isn‚Äôt technically insider info.   


The formula to this in my opinion is simple. If everyone does passive investing, i.e., just invest in index funds and never do research, then good companies would never see a bump in their price and valuation as a reward from investors. Therefore, break-away active investors looking at these stocks could take advantage and make bigger profits versus the majority of people not doing research. More and more people realize this and switch over to active research to try and get a piece of the bigger pie. And then so many people start active investing and finding the smallest piece of public information on the company that the advantage and information edge erodes away, leaving everyone worse off exactly like the prisoner‚Äôs dilemma. That‚Äôs why I think despite professionals underperforming benchmarks over the long-term, there will always be an active investing community for this reason.   
While I don‚Äôt think the semi-strong efficient market hypothesis is 100% accurate over the short-term (there are some market inefficiencies out there) I think over the long-term it is practically factual.   
  
Simplified TL:DR analogy:   
\-	if everyone cooperates and passive invests, everyone gets the most profit.  
  
\-	If there are a few breakaways that defect and active invest ‚Äì they get the most profit instead of the passive investors since they‚Äôll have an information edge.  
  
\-	Many realize this and start active investing ‚Äì everyone profits less and waste a ton of time and energy as the information edge disappears.  
  
I also believe people still active invest despite knowing this for the same reason people go to casino despite knowing it‚Äôs rigged for the house‚Ä¶ except the stock market has much better odds of making money even if it‚Äôs less than the average.

  
I have had this in my mind for quite a well and would welcome any thoughts or differing opinions.

I put $600 a month into my portfolio ($150/week), and i tested out the idea with 3 shares of VOO came out to about $1,300ish which i now have $900ish left on margin to pay off 

Main question: with a current portfolio size of $47,000 say if i keep doing this and use maybe max of 5% (we'll say $2,500)margin to buy some shares and pay off the margin over time would it be worth it? The intrest doesnt seem like it would even be a hindrance maybe about $30 a month. Now i know in the grand scheme of things im paying slightly more at the moment due to intrest for some positions but couldnt it pay off in the long term since ill have the bigger position sizes, and bigger dividend payouts from some holding to help negate the intrest accrued from the inital purchase?

Side note i do have enough JEPI to pay about 100 in dividends monthly so if i want to turn that off for maybe 2 months it would pay more then any accrued intrest. Whats everyones thoughts

https://www.wsj.com/business/media/americans-are-canceling-more-of-their-streaming-services-fb9284c8

* About one-quarter of U.S. subscribers to major streaming services‚Äîa group that includes Apple TV+, Discovery+, Disney+, Hulu, Max, Netflix, Paramount+, Peacock and Starz‚Äîhave canceled at least three of them over the past two years, according to November data from subscription-analytics provider Antenna. Two years ago, that number stood at 15%, a sign that streaming users are becoming increasingly fickle.

* Among the U.S. customers who joined Disney+ for the first time in November or converted from a trial, nearly 60% opted for the ad-supported tier. That figure was bolstered by Black Friday promotion and is up from 25% in December 2022, when the ad tier was launched. 

* More than one-third of new U.S. Netflix customers in November opted for the ad tier, compared with 11% a year earlier, when the ad-supported version was introduced. Streamers say ad-supported plans are a win-win for them and price-sensitive customers, bringing in revenue from monthly subscriptions as well as ad sales.


It‚Äôs getting a lot harder for streaming services to hold on to their customers.

Crystal Revis, a mother of six in Lynn Haven, Fla., recently canceled her subscriptions to Disney
+ and Paramount+, among others, because of their swelling price tags and the rising cost of living. She is also considering canceling Netflix, home to shows such as ‚ÄúThe Crown‚Äù and films including ‚ÄúLeave the World Behind.‚Äù

Revis is among the consumers nationwide paring their streaming bills and getting more strategic about when they turn services on and off. Customer defections across premium streaming services rose to 6.3% in November, from 5.1% a year earlier. 



[Switched Off - Customer cancellation chart](https://i.imgur.com/XSIM5tw.png)

‚ÄúWith the streaming services increasing their rates like they are, it‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄòOK, do I pay for the cable?‚Äô‚Äù Revis, who is in her 40s, said of deciding what home entertainment to select.

Under pressure to improve profitability and avoid having to reacquire users, streamers are trying a range of tactics to retain customers, from launching lower-cost ad-supported tiers of service, to teaming up with rivals on bundled deals and providing discounts or free months of service.

Revis planned to cancel Hulu, home to shows such as ‚ÄúFaraway Downs‚Äù and ‚ÄúOnly Murders in the Building,‚Äù but decided to keep it because the service offered her six months of its ad-supported service for $2.99 a month, less than half of its typical $7.99-a-month price.

Beni Goldenberg, 48 years old, has downgraded some services to control costs. In 2023, he switched from a $22.99-a-month premium Netflix plan to its $15.49-a-month standard plan, limiting the number of devices that can watch the service at the same time and lowering the viewing resolution. Netflix has long had the lowest rate of customer defections among major streamers.

[Watch, Cancel, Go - Percentage of streaming services canceled](https://i.imgur.com/hV4Np2q.png)

Goldenberg also cancels sports add-ons to his YouTube TV subscription when events are over. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm focusing on the ones that me and my family watch the most,‚Äù said the father of two in North Texas, who typically watches movies and TV shows on Disney+ with his family on Friday nights.

Some customers who turn off a service return to it later, according to Antenna. 

One in four people who cancel a premium streaming service typically resubscribes to that service within four months, and one in three does so within seven months. Half do so within two years.

‚ÄúRetention doesn‚Äôt just mean holding on to a new subscriber the first time they get them. It‚Äôs about managing a relationship over a true customer lifetime,‚Äù said Jonathan Carson, co-founder and chief executive of Antenna. Antenna compiles data from third-party services that collect information from consumers, with their consent, such as online purchases, bills and banking records.

Streamers will have to become more sophisticated about when they try to win back customers, he said. For example, they might target ads and marketing efforts at people who tend to watch at a certain time of year.

Ad-supported plans offer streaming services a way to attract new customers and win back those who have canceled their subscriptions and want to pay less. 

Among the U.S. customers who joined Disney+ for the first time in November or converted from a trial, nearly 60% opted for the ad-supported tier. That figure was bolstered by Black Friday promotion and is up from 25% in December 2022, when the ad tier was launched. 

[Returning to the Stream](https://i.imgur.com/Fa2Jwwd.png)


More than one-third of new U.S. Netflix customers in November opted for the ad tier, compared with 11% a year earlier, when the ad-supported version was introduced. Streamers say ad-supported plans are a win-win for them and price-sensitive customers, bringing in revenue from monthly subscriptions as well as ad sales.

Some rivals have begun bundling their ad-supported tiers of service, offering a discounted rate in the hopes that customers see value in the offering and stick around longer. Verizon in early December began offering some of its customers a bundle that includes the ad-supported tiers of Netflix and Max for about $10 a month, instead of about $17.

Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav has said bundling is an important part of the business‚Äôs future and can provide a good customer experience. Disney has said customers are less likely to cancel its streaming service when they pay for its bundle of Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu. 

Brendan Byrne, a 40-year-old father of four in the Boston area, pays for streaming services including Netflix, the Disney bundle, Amazon Prime Video and Paramount+, in addition to cable, but is starting to question the value of some of those subscriptions. 

After the 2023 Hollywood writers and actors strikes, ‚Äúthe lack of content is evident across all of these streaming things right now,‚Äù he said. 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll cut back on a few of them,‚Äù Byrne said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just not using them.‚Äù",2024-01-03,0

1719,Deciding REITS for my portfolio. But lack the confidence in knowing how to valuate each choice.,5,18x2tzp,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18x2tzp/deciding_reits_for_my_portfolio_but_lack_the/,72,"Obviously I want the best to profit the most and don't want to waste time trying learn through experience unless I have the tools to do it efficiently.

I am trying to be a combination of investing types or styles. First is Core and Satellite Investing,  GARP Investing, and Passive Aggressive Investing.

My Portfolio so far is QQQM, AMZN, AAPL, and GLD.

The list of REITS I am trying to decide on adding to the portfolio is this

They all provide monthly dividends because of my preference.

* Realty Income Corporation (O) (I know O is popular choice with its consistent growing dividends)
* Stag Industrial, Inc. (STAG)
* EPR Properties (EPR)
* LTC Properties, Inc. (LTC)
* Global Net Lease, Inc. (GNL)
* Gladstone Commercial Corporation (GOOD)

I have some google sheets made by someone online that I bought for cheap to find good stocks by different stock model valuations. But the person has a reit valuation model and a stock valuation model.

This makes me uncertain since I would want it to be O but I don't want to be bias because of the hype of a single stock.

From my REIT model GNL and GOOD are considered a buy. while the rest at the moment are considered a sell.

But compared to stock valuation O, STAG, EPR, and LTC are considered a buy

This leaves me uncertain is GNL and GOOD considered undervalued? or are both valuation models ineffective?

Then I try using finviz screener and STAG is the only one to show some good fundamentals.

What am I supposed to be looking at fundamentally?

Is there a difference for fundamentals for a reit versus a common stock?

I understand fundamentals as far as personal experience and having a major in finance. But I am seeking reassurance as for what values , ratios, and other data. I should be looking at to find profitable opportunities to buy.

&#x200B;

This is what I have been told to pay attention to or learned online.  All of these fundamentals are from FINVIZ because that is my main stock screener.

P/E , PEG, P/S, P/B, Price/ cash, Price/FCFF, eps growth past 5 years, dividend yield, debt to equity, and operating margin.

I am seeking reassurance or help for me to understand this better. I am honestly just being lazy and just want to make sure I am learning the correct or important stuff. 

&#x200B;

edit: I learned a little bit of fundamentals but not much. It is just smarter to go towards the benchmark since a stock would not be capable of consistently beating the benchmark.  so this helped narrow down my choices with  new ones

1720,What is a Trader (Honest Opinion),0,18x29dm,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18x29dm/what_is_a_trader_honest_opinion/,5,"Note: English is not my first language, so I apologize for any errors, but I believe the most important thing is the message I want to convey. I think the text below will add value to your life as a trader.  
  
\*\*Trading Schools\*\*  
  
Price Action... works  
  
SMC... works  
  
ICT... maybe works (I know very little about it)  
  
Indicators... work  
  
Fundamental analysis... works  
  
Each trading school has its advantages and disadvantages, so master it from basic to advanced knowledge. Gain knowledge to put into practice.  
  
\*\*When I think of a trader, I think of two areas/professions\*\*  
  
1. High-performance athlete: look at Cristiano Ronaldo, Lewis Hamilton, Michael Phelps, Lewis Hamilton, Serena Williams, and many others. They do the same thing countless times, seeking to improve physical and mental aspects to achieve their goals gradually and consistently, striving for excellence at all times.  
2. Artists: You may know how to play Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, but you will never be Beethoven; he was unique. Artists create their own style, their own signature. So stop trying to copy strategies or trading styles from someone; inspiration is not a copy.  
  
\*\*Gurus and Influencers\*\*  
  
Avoid videos with catchy thumbnails and titles, or influencers with screenshots of high results or photos of a luxurious life; most of them are monetizing your attention, either through ads or selling courses. Many times, these people don't even engage in trading. There are many individuals with technical/academic knowledge and market reputation, people with theses, reputable books, but the majority of people shy away from knowledge and prefer a 15-minute video.  
  
\*\*You don't need money to start\*\*  
  
Unlike any other field, in the financial market, you can open an account with a broker and have a completely free demo account with entirely free platforms. Use this as an advantage to conduct your backtests and forward testing. The internet is vast; look for books or academic articles that bring knowledge into your life; finding a PDF nowadays is quite simple.  
  
And to conclude the most important point...  
  
\*\*A trader needs to make trades to be a trader\*\*  
  
Yes, it's obvious, but not everyone practices it. A trader doesn't spend countless hours watching video courses, browsing hundreds of blogs, forums, and social networks looking for the holy grail of indicators or the perfect strategy. Develop your strategy based on your technical knowledge. Don't just stick to theories; you need to spend countless hours in front of charts, learn about scientific methodology, and incorporate it into your style. Have clear rules in your trades and keep things simple.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

1729,"I went through the biggest 1,500 stocks by size one by one and picked out the 248 best. Here's the list:",1169,18wepcr,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18wepcr/i_went_through_the_biggest_1500_stocks_by_size/,315,"# LINKS AT BOTTOM

This is not a holy grail list, nor investment advice. It is merely a starting point for those that want a small enough list to go through, filtering out to only consistently growing companies, no stunted/stagnant growth. There is also a list for a further refine into 72 ""most consistent"", and 35 & 38 value stocks currently at a discount from the ""most consistent"" list, but read the disclaimer about this, an expensive stock could stay expensive and vice versa for ""cheap"".

# ***METHODOLOGY:

1. I have analyzed each company blind, meaning I cannot see any information about the underlying stock including but not limited to; ticker, sector, industry, price, etc. This is to help eliminate bias.
2. I am sparingly looking at price movement to discern good companies, I will speak more about this later.
3. I am using 1Y, 2Y, 3Y, 4Y, 5Y, 10Y, 15Y, 20Y, 25Y time periods and select periods within each timeframe. Aggregation Periods range from Quarterly to 10Y.
4. The financial metrics I am analyzing; Revenue, Net Earnings, Free Cash Flow, Operating Cash Flow, Current Ratio, Quick Ratio, FCF/Expenses, etc. as well as price/metric for each of these per timeframe.
   1. Using each of the various time periods, I plot a logarithmic/exponential regression of each of these financial metrics. Along with the regression, a correlation coefficient (R\^2) is pulled to measure consistency. and consistency of that consistency over time.
5. Now, the analysis;
   1. The first deal breaker is low revenue growth or negative (which is immediately thrown out). Everything within a company can be stellar but no growth in overall sales is simply unsustainable for true long term growth unless it changes in the future. I am defining low revenue growth as 5% or less, although 10%+ is preferred and ultimately for the most part are the only ones that made it through to the end.
   2. The next filter is every other basic financial metric (EPS, FCF, OCF, BV, etc), is it growing? is the growth consistent (high correlation with the regression). With these the cutoff is minimum 10%+ / year average growth. If any of these don't meet the par, they are tossed.
      1. Income, FCF, Revenue Growth 10%+
      2. Current & Quick Ratio >1
      3. A high FCF/Expenses ratio is very attractive, as it means they have a lot of leftover cash : total expenses. Let's say it's 30%, all else equal they can increase their expenses by 30% (if they spend all their leftover cash) and in turn (all else equal) increase everything by 30% roughly speaking.
      4. And an overall high R\^2 to measure consistency & stability of each.
6. Growth Adjustments:
   1. Price metrics, is their PE growing? Is their PEG growing? these don't dictate wether a stock stays or gets tossed directly, I am only using this to adjust the growth of the stock to fit PE appreciation/depreciation which \*could\* toss out an all around 10%+ growth stock because of consistently depreciating PE.
   2. Dividend Yield, this just turns the above return into total return which can make a significant difference in the case of an average growing company but one that pays a substantial dividend.
7. Full IRR Calculation, for both growth & value:
   1. This is how many years it would take to get a full IRR, rounded up to an upper bound (slower turnaround), given 3 things *this does not fully count stock price appreciation yet, just actual IRR, I will try to workout the equation for that too*:
      1. Intrinsic Growth Rate (CAGR of intrinsic value of company)
      2. PE (EPS as the current point in the regression of the EPS over each timeframe, to help smooth out outlier earnings in an otherwise stabling growing EPS)
      3. PE Growth (Regression of PE over each timeframe, average growth rate then annualized)
      4. I will be adding FCF % of Market Cap to account for buyback potential
   2. The equation is as follows: ---  x=‚à´‚ÇÄ^(y)  (g + 1)\^y da  ---  x is PE, g is Intrinsic growth rate, y is ""Years to full IRR"". You can access the graph [HERE](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/pz4kmefqzw)
8. FOR THE ""MOST CONSISTENT"" index, the methodology is the same as above with much stricter cutoffs; there can't be (if any) periods of stagnant growth over any time frame outlined above, and R\^2 must be fairly high (>0.9) for most financials in general. One great example is FICO (R\^2 of 0.93 for EPS Growth, Revenue Growth @ 0.98, FCF Growth @ 0.98). \~0.95 correlation to a return of 25% yearly growth with 0 volatility, over decades is so hard to accomplish. Even .75 is difficult for most companies to sustain.\*\*\*METHODOLOGY ABOVE\*\*\*

&#x200B;

\*This is not investment advice, I am not a CFA or anything like that to be giving any direct investment advice, this is just my personal list of stocks I believe have good strong consistent growth, however it‚Äôs possible for some of them to underperform expectations, just as any stock

Edit: The 248 list is still solid and on the side managed to bring it down to the 72 most consistent, the google sheet & image have been adjusted to also show this last refination(? if that's even a word). this 72 represents the most consistent and noticeable growth in fundamentals and financials over multiple time frames, out of the original 1,500, represents only 4.8% that met those requirements. Interestingly enough, it's almost exactly the 2 STDEV percentile aka. 95% percentile.

EDIT: PART 2; link [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18x1w5i/part_2_of_i_went_through_the_biggest_1500_stocks/)

I'll get straight to the point; I went through the entire S&P 500, 400 & 600 (S&P 1500) one by one, looking at each individual company's financials and price accordingly. Refined the list from the base 1,500 to just 248 that had the most consistent growth on; income statements, balance sheets, cash flows, and share price ratios to each respectively. Any companies that showed a recession in growth or a decline in financials were immediately eliminated. The broad index does not discriminate between growing and declining companies, just on size so there's a solid amount of stocks that drawdown the performance of the underlying index, my effort is to ""refine"" the index to only contain consistently growing companies.

I don't have enough time or space to show the analysis of each, and recommend anyone taking this list to research any given company themselves because I am not that qualified to blindly suggest any stocks.

I will organize the list in a readable and easily navigable manner as much as one can for and index of 248 companies.

\*\*In an attempt to take out all biases when picking each stock out, I evaluated them blind (not looking at the ticker or any information that would tell me what the company is, some of the results from this from types of stocks \*not\* chosen and types of stocks that \*were\* chosen to be on the list were slightly surprising and sort of interesting.

I've got a margin account with IBKR and can borrow $300k at the moment. So I buy $100k of a blue chip stock that I wouldn't mind holding long term, and auto sell it when it's +2.5%, thus netting $2.5k pre tax. My theory is I'm unlikely to buy at a long term peak, and even if I do, the worst thing is that I've got a big stake In a blue chip. 

My 100k club includes:
Apple
Msft
Meta
Brk
Bhp
Rio

Currently up $10k, done this 4 times (once with an index ETF which I won't do again). Most trades have closed within a weak, I panicked with meta and sold early after it came back , and it then went up n up. Need to stick to the plan.

Opened my brokerage account at the beginning of the pandemic and have been consistently putting money in. Currently about 70k in the account, split 80% mutual/ETF and 20% individual stocks. The individual stocks I have purchased at the beginning of my journey when I did not know much about the market and they are the source of unrealized losses, including tesla, biontech, Moderna, alibaba, apple. Now, I wish to be more safe and put my money in mutual/ETF. My question is should I sell the individual stocks within the next year or two or try to hold onto them since they make up only a small part of my portfolio and they may make improve in the long term?

Edit: the 80% are put in low fee index funds and have gained enough to offset the loss. I'm not interested in trading for short term gains and prefer to hold my investments until retirement if possible. ",2024-01-01,0

>An investor in Twitter has written down the value of its stake by $2.85bn (¬£2.2bn) after Elon Musk told boycotting advertisers to ‚Äúgo f‚Äî yourself‚Äù.

Fidelity, which helped Mr Musk buy the company for $44bn (¬£35bn) in 2022, now believes the company is worth 71.5pc less than at the time of purchase.

The US investment giant had already slashed the value of its investment by 65pc at the end of October but deepened the discount in November. It came in the same month that Twitter‚Äôs billionaire owner launched a tirade against advertisers.

Speaking at a New York Times conference, Mr Musk claimed a boycott by advertisers was going to ‚Äúkill‚Äù the company, adding: ‚ÄúIf somebody is going to try to blackmail me with advertising, blackmail me with money, go f--- yourself.‚Äù

Apple, IBM and Disney are among the major brands to cut ties with the social media platform, amid concerns about lax moderation under Mr Musk and the billionaire‚Äôs freewheeling personal style.

Fidelity‚Äôs valuation cut, which was first reported by Axios, gives the company a notional value of just $12.5bn and suggests Twitter has lost $2.85bn of worth in the eyes of Fidelity in just four weeks.

The investment group, which contributed more than $300m to Mr Musk‚Äôs takeover, does not disclose how it values privately held companies. Other shareholders may value their stakes differently.

However, Twitter‚Äôs own internal stock plan for staff valued the company at just $19bn in October ‚Äì less than half the sum Mr Musk paid for it.",2024-01-01,0

1739,5 Traits of Companies that have Outperformed,101,18w3pwn,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18w3pwn/5_traits_of_companies_that_have_outperformed/,101,"1. Lower Debt Levels

The world is uncertain and when things go against you, debt magnifies the negative. Of course it can magnify good things as well, but the data reviewed suggests that the best performers get their without high levels of debt.

2. Higher Growth on a Per Share Basis

In things like sales, operating cash flow and free cash flows. The per share component is critical because growth at all costs (especially diluting shareholders) hurts performance

3. Higher Gross Margins

High gross margins suggest that the company can create something of significant value in excess of competition. For a product company, the inputs to make say a cell phone are all more or less the same, being able to sell far in excess of those same ingredients is an indication of pricing power.

4. Operate in a Capital Efficient Manner

This helps to ensure low dilution and low debt hold over time. To model this I used Gross Profits / Operating Assets. Operating assets are defined as Total Assets - market investments. 

5. Sell at a reasonable Price

Even if you meet the criteria of the other 4 to a high degree, the company is not worth an infinite price. I ranked companies by their Gross Profits / Market Cap.


I then plugged this information into Portfolio123. This is back testing software that makes adjustments for when financial data was released (in other words no look ahead bias). I then ranked companies that are part of the Russell 1000 into 10 groups. Higher ranked companies meet more of the criteria mentioned and lesser ranked companies do not meet the conditions mentioned.

The results: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10UJ3-oVJVzDbh4Xclsfdrs9fbPk-TvM6u1nrK6dBxF4/edit

Other Notes: All data above looks at past financial data that would have been available at the time.

Why the focus on Gross vs Net Profits? As mentioned, in my view Gross profits may indicate pricing power. Also when dealing with financials in bulk as you move down the income statement the data can get more noisy. For example in the last few years, gains and losses are required to -ass through the income statement even though it doesn‚Äôt make economic sense (you can look up the values of these securities on the balance sheet). Also I realized companies make trade offs farther down the income statement that are neither good nor bad but could be screened out if we only looked at operating or net profits. For example for 2 decades AMZN and CRM purposefully invested aggressively and never showed gains in profits despite a torrid growth pace. This was ultimately wise as they gobbled up more market share. Only recently (particularly for CRM) have profits started as revenue growth has slowed and les investment is needed.

Hopefully the screenshot I've provided is clear enough but just to add some context, the companies I've invested in more than once are:

Agronomics, Merck KGaA, Emmerson, Berkshire, Brookfield, Microsoft, ASTS and Rocket Lab. Most of the others I'm happy to just let run at this stage.

I'm in my early 30s so I was looking to take some risks (clearly). There's no incentive to invest in an ETF where I'm based (otherwise I wouldn't be stock picking). In hindsight I made some really poor decisions when I started out and it's sort of made me put my money on deposit since late 2022. I'm not sure what's the best move here.
 
&nbsp;

My current position is:  
&nbsp;

70k on deposit. I'm holding it for a potential house deposit down the line.&nbsp;

41k invested since the end of 2021 but this is now only worth 31k.  


&nbsp;

 

The stocks I'm no longer convinced by: 

&nbsp;


ASTS 

Polight 

Rocket Lab 

Steakholder Foods (formerly MITC)

Does it even make sense to get rid of some of these if I'm planning to hold onto Berkshire, Alphabet etc for the foreseeable future? Is it basically just a case of letting the losers run and then offsetting them against any gains down the line?

1745,My attempt at DD for INTC in 2024,69,18vjzsf,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18vjzsf/my_attempt_at_dd_for_intc_in_2024/,58,"Below is my novice attempt at providing half-decent DD in support a thesis. Two caveats: 1) I wanted to focus on US-based companies, and 2) This is a play in my Roth IRA ‚Äì Buy and Hold long term.

Reading the book CHIP WARS changed my portfolio and investment strategy. I‚Äôd heard of TSMC, AMD and NVDA, but wasn‚Äôt really sure how to quantify their value or compare against one another other than stock price (NVDA must be the best one, right?). According to the author, chips are the new gold, and will shape the global power alignment for the next couple decades. The book talks a ton about the history of semiconductors and the processes needed to create them, then and now, highlighting several key dependencies in the manufacturing and supply chain that I thought would represent potential targets for investment.

I began researching the supply chain in greater detail in the hopes of making it easier for a non-technical guy like me to understand the holistic system from a systems theory approach. A Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) article had a few graphics that helped The article. First is the value chain showing the 3 steps to chip creation; design, fabrication, and Assembly, Test, and Packaging (ATP).

Cool, now I just find out who does all of these things and invest, right? Not saying that wouldn‚Äôt work, but I‚Äôm kind of looking for an undervalued company with potential to grow (NVDA is out of my league at \~500/share, and probably overpriced). There are a lot of companies that compete in these spaces, some in one, many in multiple.

Design:

I focused on Design and Fabrication. There may be diamonds in the rough for ATP, but it was quite a bit broad in my initial research, and hard to narrow down/nothing stood out.

Starting with Design, the CSIS article provided a good starting point with a list of several major players. The same article stated that ‚Äúin the US and UK, Intel, ARM, and Cadence were core leaders in Intellectual property. For that reason, they were the three I chose to focus on.

Fabrication:

Fabrication plants (Fabs) are the most critical physical component in the manufacturing process, and there is a disproportionate dependency on TSMC fabs in Taiwan. There could be another post on the potential for China/Taiwan issues having a significant impact on the chip market, but for now, I will just highlight that the smallest chips in the world currently in mass production (3nm) are produced in TSMC and Samsung Fabs, making them key centers of gravity in the semi world.

But fabs are simply another ‚Äúsystem‚Äù in the larger system‚Ä¶ What are they made of? The three key components for fabs are lithography machines, ultra-pure air, and ultra-pure water. So I began to look at what companies specialize in those areas‚Ä¶

Advanced Semiconductor Materials Lithography (ASML) has a basic monopoly on Lithography machines, and recently sold its next generation lithography machines to Intel (more on that below). There are no shortage of Water and Air manufacturing companies. Again, focusing on US based companies, I arrived at Air Products ($APD), Hitachi ($HTHIY), and Xylem ($XYL).

US based APD has been relatively stagnant, but HTHIY has been on a general uptrend for a couple years now. This maybe an option as I get more comfortable with investments with overseas companies, but for now I move on to water. XYL hasn‚Äôt shown a lot of movement, but they do offer a small dividend. Still, not enough potential for growth in my opinion.

So, we have INTC with a ton of intellectual property and next generation Fab capabilities on the horizon. One final step before dumping my IRA into INTC; CEO research? I evaluated three basic components ‚Äì Who is the CEO, what he‚Äôs saying, and what he‚Äôs actually doing about it...

The CEO: If there was a ‚ÄúChips hall of fame,‚Äù Pat Gelsinger would be in it. He started at Intel in 1979, and has since made pit stops at several huge tech companies (e.g. VM Ware) along his way back to being named CEO in 2021. Bottom Line: Dude understands the industry and the company inner workings well.

What he‚Äôs saying: He‚Äôs put out several bold statements in the last couple years regarding Intel falling behind in AI, and wanting to catch up quickly. His product line going through intel right now is impressive, he‚Äôs doubling down on US-based production, and should compete with the major names in the AI Chips space in the near future with intel 4 CPUs and Meteor Lake CPUs.

What he‚Äôs doing: Pat Gelsingers major investments are currently focused on manufacturing, emphasizing bringing more chip production to the US. In Arizona, Intel invested $30 billion in two chip factories in Chandler. This is their biggest commitment to domestic chip production, and will produce advanced chips. As I mentioned above, Intel will be the first company to get the EUV lithography tool with a 0.55 numeric aperture (high-NA) from ASML this year and it's also going to obtain the majority of the company's machines in 2024. (What does high NA mean? Link below in comments) A unique opportunity associated with these new high-NA machines is the need for a lot of instrumentation and calibration. MKS Instruments ($MKSI) has been a long-time partner of Intel, and actually have a large location in Beaverton, Oregon, about 10 miles from the new Lithography machines location in at the Intel facility in Hillsboro, Oregon. MKSI has moved with INTC over the last few weeks as a sympathy play, but is approaching a $110 resistance line. If it gets through that, there is quite a bit of room to run prior to ATHs. They also pay a small dividend (1.29%). Maybe a side play with a LEAPS contract or two.

My plan is pretty simple, I think. Put 7K contribution into INTC (140 shares at $50). This will bring me to a total of 340 shares. Sell 3x Jan 26 $60 strike covered calls (\~$8 each) and put the $2400 in premium back into more INTC shares.

I'm sure I screwed some stuff up, and satisficed my way into an INTC outcome, but this was my zig zag research process.

(edit) TL;DR: INTC is likely to move up in the chip space as they prioritize next gen fabrication and AI. New fabs in Ohio, Israel, and Germany. My $7K IRA contribution this year is going all to INTC shares.",2023-12-31,0

Here is my first plan:

All in TLT. And when the government is going to drop the interest rate, the price will go up, then I will sell it to get capital gain between 15% to 40% based on the historical data, and if the unlikely recession will ever happens, the gain can be even more.

After that, if the market is still hot and unpredictable, I will do fractional share reinvestment with DCA:

25% SCHG
20% Nvdia (stock) or SMH
20% XLK
20% VT
15% Inda

Then in the future, when the stock market is will drop, I will invest the lump sum into them with the same percentage. And maybe one day, when technology is not the driver of the stock market anymore, I can replace technology ETFs with a new sector.

1758,Number of customers versus number of accounts at big investment firms ... overstated?,2,1azt786,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1azt786/number_of_customers_versus_number_of_accounts_at/,3,"I'm not sure if this is on topic for this /sr but I wonder if anyone can help,

I'm interested in how many customers or households have accounts at the big U.S. investment firms (like Schwab, Fidelity, Vanguard).

Folks in this /sr are obviously attuned to investing. But when you consider the entirety of the U.S. population - all the grandmas and folks living paycheck to paycheck and folks new to the U.S. and the fraction of households where concepts like index funds and investing just never were any part of family conversation - I think that a good fraction of the U.S. simply doesn't think of or do any investing. (At least not directly; their employer may sock away money in a 401k for them, but they don't actively manage it or have a personal account where they do their own investing.)

In particular, I'd venture that **less than half of U.S. households have a personal investment account** where they can (and do) buy/sell stocks, index funds, ETFs, etc. (Separate from, e.g., a 401(k) their employers might have made for them ... I mean an account they personally actively made and trade with.)

Where am I going with all this? Let's look at some numbers:

* [The FDIC says](https://www.fdic.gov/analysis/household-survey/index.html) there are \~108 M ""fully banked"" households in the U.S.
* [This recent Investopedia article](https://www.investopedia.com/vanguard-vs-fidelity-4587961) says Vanguard has over 30 M and Fidelity over 43 M ""individual investors""
* [This recent Schwab press release](https://pressroom.aboutschwab.com/press-releases/press-release/2023/Schwab-Reports-Monthly-Activity-Highlights-db1d3b14b/default.aspx) says it has 34 M active brokerage accounts

That's a total of 107 M investment investors and/or accounts (Vanguard 30 + Fidelity 43 + Schwab 34)

Whereas the U.S. has, at most, \~108 M households with bank accounts.

And this 107 only counts three big investment firms when there are [many others](https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/research/largest-stock-brokerage-firms/).

There's just no way that every household in the U.S. that has any bank account, also has a separate investing account they're active in (past their employer's retirement account).

So what exactly is being counted here?

I don't doubt that the counts above (30 to 40 M per firm) are accurate somehow. But ... *how*?

Could this explain it: I personally have a lot going on with a big investing firm. I have a taxable (joint with wife), a Roth IRA, and a Traditional IRA. Also my parents passed, leaving an Inherited set of the same (that's six accounts so far). Then my wife also has her own separate taxable, Roth, and Trad. IRA with that same firm.

So we are one household... but it would also be accurate to say we have nine accounts. (But note that the Investopedia article specifically says *individual investors*, not *accounts.)*

So I guess the bottom line I'm driving at here is: What **percent of households have at least one investment account**, and a direct account at that? (One they actively established and use, separate from any employer retirement accounts)

Where can one find numbers like that, and what would they be called?

But more importantly, is there a way to see this particular number for the big investment firms? (customers or households, NOT ""accounts"")

Something's not right when there's a clear impression that firms' numbers add up to way more investors in the U.S. than even have bank accounts!

I hope this is making sense. Thank you for bearing with me! I appreciate it if you can shed any light on these huge numbers.

**EDIT** a couple of hours after the above OP:

Thanks to you folks responding, I see I need to look deeper. I came across [this FINRA National Financial Capability Study](https://www.finrafoundation.org/knowledge-we-gain-share/nfcs/data-and-downloads)'s 2021 Investor Survey Report, which says (p. 3): ""In 2021, just over a third (**35 percent**) of the national population had investments in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), or other securities outside of retirement accounts. There has been a slight upward trend in the percentage of investors since 2015.""

This sounds close to how I would define people or household counts with ""active investing not including employer retirement plans"". IOW, how many *people* are in fact active investors.

But it still doesn't answer the question of how I might find similar numbers for big investment firms. they may well keep this a close-guarded secret.",2024-02-25,0

We've seen a wave of new developments like apartments and small business buildings offering space for dental clinics, gyms, food parks, and more. This has opened up services that weren't available here before.

Many customers of the said businesses are students from a nearby private school, who tend to be from wealthier families, and employees from a small corporate office. With more apartments being built, I anticipate an increase in potential customers.

I expect these developments to continue in maybe for the next 10+ years and fortunately my house is just around of all these developments, which has me thinking about how I can make the most of these opportunities. I'm in my early 20s and planning for my future, so I'm not in a rush but thinking about possibilities for the next five years or so.

One idea I had was to open a pet supplies store, as there isn't one nearby yet. The number of pet owners are still growing, especially with more couples choosing not to have children. Another, perhaps safer, option might be to invest in rental properties, although I'd need to save up a bit more to get started. ",2024-02-25,0

I plan to retire with about 2 Million dollars in my portfolio.

I'm not so well-off that I don't have sequence risk though, especially if we're talking about the 1st couple years after retirement, or the year before retirement. My expected withdrawal rate in the first 5 years of retirement is 5 or 5.5%, at which point I reach social security age and withdrawal rate drops down to 3 to 4%.

I'm planning to use the roughly 600k in Home equity I have to bridge this risk. By either refinancing the home, pulling a heloc, a sale, or a number of other ways based on what is most appropriate at that time. If the market takes a big enough crap in this very key year-range.

What I'm curious is... I've seen some numbers tossed around like.. 'the market has a XX% dip every XX many years' and 'the market tends to rebound within xx timeframe' . I am curious if a table or mathematical formula for ... let's say 'buying the dip' exists in relation to sequence risk in retirement.

Example: "" If the market goes down 10%, I will...    "" vs. 15% or 20%, etc etc.

My thought process had been, a 10% hit to the market and I might utilize a Heloc for a years worth of spending, if the market takes a 20% hit I might refinance the home, take 18 months of living expenses as cash, and add the rest of my equity to the portfolio to buy the dip. But these are just vague, feelings-based numbers I pulled off the top of my head.

I am wondering if anyone or any webpage has mathed this out extensively because I would be very interested in seeing that data and where my real numbers should be for these decisions. It would kind of be similar to the probabilities involved in 'buying the dip' so if you have some great math on that topic you think would be helpful I would be interested in reading that as well.

I'm venturing into the realm of systematic investing and am intrigued by the concept of factor-based portfolios. The idea of removing emotion from investing and relying on a predefined system or equation to guide stock selection and allocation decisions seems both challenging and rewarding.

I'm curious to learn from those who have walked this path:

1. Success Stories: Have you created and successfully managed a factor-based portfolio? I'd love to hear about your strategy, the factors you prioritize (e.g., value, momentum, quality, etc.), and how you've refined your approach over time.

2. Challenges:  Were there any unexpected hurdles in sticking to a systematic approach?

3. Tools and Platforms: This is a big one for me. Which trading platforms do you find most conducive to executing and managing a systematic portfolio? I‚Äôve been using IKBR and I'm looking for platforms that offer flexibility, robust analytical tools, and perhaps automation capabilities to streamline the process.

4. Advice for Beginners: For someone just starting their journey in systematic, non-emotional investing, what advice would you give? Any resources, books, or courses that you found invaluable?

5. Portfolio Management: How do you manage portfolio rebalancing, risk management, and keep your strategy aligned with your investment goals?

 I'm here to learn from your journeys, insights, and perhaps even your mistakes.

However, I am not sure how I would implement factors in an all-world portfolio. Say I have a 100% VWCE portfolio now, how would you start to complement it with different factor indices? I was thinking about going a 70/30 route, but instead of making it about Wolrd/EM, making it All-World/factors. One possiblity would be to add different world factor ETFs. Say an MSCI World value, quality, small cap and momentum ETF in a, say, 10/10/5/5 ratio. Another possiblity I thought about is using an equal weighted world ETF. The equal weighted S&P 500 has historically (going back decades, not just the recent past) outperformed the market weighted ETF, so using an equal weighted world ETF seems to make sense instead of the VWCE world.

I'm thinking I Bonds might be the best way to go (simply buy the max every year, forever).  
  
My understanding is that in general people are lukewarm on I Bonds because TIPS or HYSA or money market funds can provide higher returns and be more flexible. However, I'm not so sure this is true for my circumstance for a few reasons.  
  
(1) I Bonds are state/local tax free. I have an over 10% state + local tax rate now, so this is meaningful. Some other assets also have this property, but I don't right now know of any others which also have....  
  
(2) You can defer paying tax until redeeming. Right now my marginal tax rate is near 50%. So I make 5% on a HYSA and lose half of it. But in theory if I just hold the I Bonds until retirement (where my income will certainly be way way lower) then I will pay significantly less tax on the interest then I would along the way via HYSA/tips/money market etc.  
  
So my questions are: Does anything else also have the combo property of (1) and (2)? Or even just (2)...

Current situation:

\- 5% of my income goes in a trad 401k for the company match

\-  I use a trad IRA to backdoor in a Roth IRA every year

\- I invest some extra in a taxable account

&#x200B;

First question is that I want to roll over my 401k every 2 months and self manage in my trad IRA. I do not plan to backdoor these contributions because it's going to increase my tax burden and I'd rather defer some taxation for now. By doing this, does it impact my annual contribution to the trad IRA that I then roll over to a Roth? I'm not sure how the pro rata rule factors in here if at all.

My second question, is I have the option to also participate in a Roth 401k. For this scenario I'm assuming my entire match is for the trad contribution, so I could just roll over some extra capital into my Roth IRA every month. However if I decide I want the Roth contributions matched and I roll over, what tax consequences could I be looking at? If I ever wanted to withdraw the 'contributions' from the Roth IRA are matches considered gains or contributions?

Basically I want to self manage my 401k by rolling it into my IRAs and want to figure out the most efficient and least tax consequential method of doing so. I want to add a Roth 401k contribution to roll over and not sure which one to add the company match on. I hope this makes sense and thank you for the advice!",2024-02-25,0

We're in a very similar place to the tech bubble. Back then the bubble popped because companies didn't produce revenue to match the hype.

Today this seems different because some companies are making money hand over fist. However, the companies making money are those producing the infrastructure for AI, we have yet to see much revenue generated from AI itself. The similarity is that we are expecting AI itself to generate revenue similar to the startups of the first tech bubble. 

Whether or not AI can generate revenue is a different topic. I'll simply say that the current expectations of AI don't match reality. Feel free to list the companies and products that leverage AI that are also generating significant revenue directly from that AI.

Nvidia makes chips, Microsoft and others use these chips to provide AI infrastructure, the bubble is in everyone trying to use this infrastructure to create products that derive revenue. If that revenue doesn't materialize, demand will drop for infrastructure and correspondingly for chips.

* Replacing our electric resistance hot water heater with a heat pump one. This saved us about $500/year on our electric bill. It cost just under $3,000 after rebates, but less if you also consider a second rebate we got by bundling it with later air-sealing of our home, and a tax rebate. Even without the additional rebates the ROI is 16.7% which is insanely high.
* Air-sealing our home. This cost us $1675 after rebates and reduced our heating bill by about $1000 annually leading an absolutely insane ROI of nearly 60%. This not only saved a lot, but it hugely increased comfort; the house is less drafty. The ROI was so high, I'm considering hiring the same company back to further improve on their job in the coming year. I figure even if I get a lower ROI if it's still higher than 8% or so I will keep wanting to spend more.
* All energy-efficient lighting. This was one of the first things I installed in the home. Absolute value of savings were probably pretty low (~$150-ish) but the ROI was probably close to 100% because that was about as much as I spent on the lights.
* Installing a better showerhead which was both lower-flow but had better ergonomics and features. Improved quality of life but also saved water, which reduced both water and electric bills. My best estimate of savings were about $50 a year, and it only cost $70 so ROI is 71%. Small item and small absolute value of savings but absolutely massive ROI. Thinking of replacing other fixtures such as the kitchen and bathroom sink faucets, considering toilets too, but not sure if these will be favorable because installation costs may make them less favorable in terms of ROI.

The best thing about all of these modifications is that they also increased the value of our home, so they provide an extra increase in equity, which we can benefit from if we sell or refinance, but the ROI was so high it was worth doing even without this.

I think we may have already gotten most of the ""low hanging fruit"" and I doubt I'm going to be able to get as high an ROI going forward, but I am looking to continue to pursue more cost-saving investments.

Dividend? Buybacks? Nah  
  
  
  
The company has stated in its earnings call for Q4 2023 that increasing dividends or buying back shares are unlikely to happen. They are accumulating earnings to grow, most likely through an acquisition.  
  
The company is relentlessly focused on growth. As they don‚Äôt think that paying more dividends or buying back shares will increase the growth of the company in the long run, they will not do it. Instead, they‚Äôre scrutinizing the market to acquire a competitor. That would mean instant growth both in revenues and net margin. However, we‚Äôve widely seen how acquisitions all over the world, and in all industries, usually destroy value. Of course, it all depends on the discipline and patience of the management team to not rush on a deal because they have the money in their hands.  
  
The future is uncertain, though. And although I‚Äôm sure that acquiring a competitor may excite the market, it may not be the best way to go. Anyway, they operate in a great industry, with good margins. So maybe declining interest rates give them an opportunity to acquire a good business at a good price.  
  
INTRINSIC VALUE OF IBKR  
  
There is a margin of safety if we estimate that the interest rates will go down to 2%. If interest rates stay higher for longer, the margin of safety is wide.  
  
Assuming the above, the normalized net profit for the company would be sitting at $1.812M. This would mean a total market value of $49.249M, or said otherwise, a 15.68% margin of safety compared to today‚Äôs price (February 16th, 2024). For this company, given its quality, growth, and earnings visibility, I have found fair a PE ratio of 27.18 times. The required margin of safety for this company would be 12.54%, which makes IBKR a buy today. Please refer to the PE calculation at the end of the document for further details.  
  
Note about the interest rates and the normalized net profit. The company stated in the Q4 2023 conference call that every 25 basis points decrease in the benchmark would result in a $56M reduction in net income. Thus, this would mean a reduction of $784M, in line with our normalized net profit.  
  
However, the company has stated that they will be pursuing an acquisition. I haven‚Äôt accounted for the excess cash as part of the base (normalized) valuation since the management is not giving it back to shareholders. But they will be pursuing an acquisition. Assuming that they won‚Äôt allocate all their excess cash to this acquisition (they have stated that they will pursue a payment based on cash and stocks), I think that a probable scenario would be a $7B acquisition. Assuming a poor return on the acquisition of 5% net profit, that would add $350M in net profits to the company. Assuming the same PE as before, the margin of safety would increase to 38.03%. All of this, assuming lower interest rates.  
  
I consider the current M.O.S. compelling enough to invest in the company. There‚Äôs plenty of upside while the downside of the investment looks reduced. Of course, this doesn‚Äôt mean that the share price won‚Äôt fall, especially if interest rates start declining, but it won‚Äôt be a decrease in value. Rather, it would represent an outstanding investment opportunity. However, the fact that the company is not willing to buy back shares or increase its dividend is also worth noting. I don‚Äôt think that the company will waste its money on acquisitions since the management has stated that they have refused two potential acquisitions due to price discrepancies. But if they do, we should revisit the assumptions made to give IBKR a PE ratio of 27 times.

Perhaps I'm misremembering or misconstruing the original post I read though, but I believe it was basically stressing that kids would be better off with parents going the investing route.

My two stepsons both have Greenlight accounts and 529 accounts. Their mom makes occasional investments for them long-term through Greenlight on certain stocks, and they can use their Greenlight cards for purchasing things occasionally with approval. I'm trying to start a game plan for my 4 year old.

&#x200B;

* 529 route limits spending to educational purposes and living, correct?
   * Upside: Tax free for college spending.
   * Downside: Limited to college spending. Low interest rate.
* Investing (perhaps just S&P500?), would be more lucrative and perhaps pan out better? 
   * Upside: Earn more money off of the investments after taxes vs. tax free 529. Can spend anywhere as needed once cashed out.
   * Downside: Taxed whenever deciding to sell. Can lose money on investments if buying into the wrong choices or a market crash.

1795,Nvidia's AI moat is both more and less than you might think,57,1ayr42z,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ayr42z/nvidias_ai_moat_is_both_more_and_less_than_you/,51,"Nvidia seems to be a really hot topic here with the recent AI craze so I figured I should chime in some thoughts I don't see mentioned enough or at all. *This will get a tiny bit technical.*

Nvidia's current dominance in both gaming performance and deep learning performance is undisputed. What people often overlook though is that Nvidia's cards can also be used for accelerating (among others) 1) rendering workloads (e.g. animations and effects for commercials or movies), 2) physics simulations, 3) video transcoding (maybe video content platforms?), and 4) non-deep-learning-based machine learning.

## Nvidia's moat is less than you might think

For **inference** and specifically **edge** workloads, Nvidia's moat is tiny to non-existent.

Nvidia faces competition from Google (TPUs), Intel / Apple / Snapdragon / others (AI on CPUs and SBCs), Intel / AMD (GPUs), Intel / Google / others (accelerators / compute sticks), and everyone who has any sort of custom chip. 

Various ML/AI models running on flagship phones, VR headsets, internet browsers, SBCs, and even gaming PCs (e.g. upscalers) have been running on ARM, Intel, and AMD chips for nearly a decade. Even LLMs have been receiving some love and work on getting them running on CPUs and AMD GPUs, with the smaller models (1-7B, especially aggressively-quantized ones) running somewhat decently on just CPU+RAM (e.g. 1-2 words / second on a RaspberryPi 5). 

> But is this representative of the industry? 

Well, kinda. Edge inferencing (smartphone, VR, SBCs, browser, ...) is growing and will probably continue to grow quickly. Small LLMs are also **very** relevant to large tech companies (my current employer primarily uses 7-70B models for most products, plus OpenAI / Microsoft / AWS / Anthropic integrations) for both fine-tuning and inferencing. My wider department has 10+ projects working on such LLMs and services around them. AMD GPUs for inferencing are also gaining steam with projects like vLLM adding support (Jan 2024) for ROCm.

> Wait a moment, you mentioned fine-tuning. You don't do that on a CPU or AMD GPU, right?

Correct, which brings us to...

## Nvidia's moat is more than you might think

While inferencing can happen (and does happen) anywhere (e.g. we're using non-GPU instances for quite a few workloads), **training** and **fine-tuning** *only ever happens on Nvidia GPUs*. There a few reasons for that.

First, training and fine-tuning are way more intensive (and thus require more acceleration) than other workloads, so fully leveraging Nvidia's acceleration capabilities is critical. It's not just CUDA and deep learning frameworks (pytorch, tensorflow, ...). There are over 20 really popular projects that are directly based on Nvidia GPUs (e.g. TensorRT-LLM, cuFFT, cuBLAS, cudf, nvvl, ...) or only come with CUDA-support out of the box (e.g. RAPIDS, XGBoost). 

Even if/when other GPUs/accelerators fully catch up (which will take a while even when pooling AMD and community contributions), that would still not be enough. Training & fine-tuning on just one GPU is not very common anymore. Even for a smaller non-LLM model I trained early last year, I had to use 4-8 GPUs for a reasonable training completion time. For LLMs, it's even worse; you often need multiple GPUs on multiple servers and pooling them is no easy task. *And even if you implement the pooling of those GPUs in software (e.g. AMD contributes to pytorch/tensorflow), then you would still lag behind Nvidia*, simply because they have also done work for that on the hardware side (e.g. NVLink/NVSwitch, DGX/OVX systems).

Finally, inferencing. I touched on this in the previous section and mentioned that Nvidia might not be a monopoly, but that was only partially true. While inferencing with decent quality and latency can and does happen on other devices, inferencing at scale massively benefits from being done on a single place (e.g. on some cloud with Nvidia GPUs) both from a cost standpoint (resource management & economies of scale) and a latency one. Both AMD and Intel have tons of data center experience, but they just aren't there yet, and these take years to develop.

## Conclusion

Will edge inferencing eat away at Nvidia's earnings? Nah, these were mostly separated from the beginning, and disproportionate increases of edge over cloud computing are not something I'd bet on. Will people keep buying Nvidia GPUs like they do now? No idea, but large data centers (e.g. AWS, Azure, Meta) will re-cycle their GPUs every a few years to get the newest (and supported) stuff, and by the time the next cycle comes, I think the overwhelming majority of sales will still end up Nvidia's way. 2-3 cycles later? No idea, but Nvidia's sales still won't be low because supporting legacy systems is an almost-necessary thing. Is the valuation of today pricing all these in? No idea. Is AI a bubble? Nope, LLMs and prompting may or may not be, but AI (or ML) doesn't end there. The hype around AI may subside, as it has done 3-5 times in the past, but we still haven't fully exported the possibilities of the the current wave so let's not kill it too early.

And I‚Äôve definitely been posting a lot on it. But it is, according to Goldman Sachs, ‚Äúthe most important stock in the world.‚Äù

And we only have to look at the earnings call and how it snapped a sinking market back forward again adding more money to its cap in a day than any stock in history. 

Okay. Rah rah. But what about the competition? That much money and someone(s) are gonna try and steal a piece and poach your employees. 

So this one is for the nays and even the yays like me who want perspective.

> The Nvidia bandwagon is packed and everyone is jumping on it. It‚Äôs fun to be right and more fun to be right in good company. But what if everyone is wrong? Isn‚Äôt it this type of mania and exuberance that should give the market pause? 

> Nvidia has effectively grown to more than 98% of the market for data-center graphics processing units, or GPUs, due to a complete lack of meaningful competition. This early lead has given the company unbounded pricing power, driving its margins in the most recent quarter to over 76%.

> over the past few months we have seen signs of competition entering the market. This will affect Nvidia‚Äôs margins and the company‚Äôs ability to continue to grow at such a staggering rate. 

> the competition is coming from an array of places [in addition to AMD who is predicting $4B for their new GPU] that include a number of Nvidia‚Äôs largest and most important customers. For example, Amazon.com Inc.‚Äôs AWS cloud has its AI chips for training and inference, Microsoft recently announced its Maia AI chip, and Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs Google continues to innovate on its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Oracle Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. are also developing AI chips in house. 

> not as much an indictment on Nvidia as they are a realization by these companies that overdependence on a single source for AI semiconductors is a risk

> In short, competition is real and it is coming to Nvidia in a meaningful way. More competition pressures Nvidia‚Äôs pricing, margins and market share, as well as its rates of revenue and EPS growth. ",2024-02-24,0

Assume this scenario:  
\- Mid 30‚Äôs.  
\- Saving \~100k per year.  
\- Current portfolio is several hundred thousand. 2/3 in cash 1/3 in VFV.  
\- Wanting to ‚Äúretire‚Äù in 6-8 years with \~$3,500/month in dividend income.

The thing I care about most is monthly cashflow. I‚Äôm not hugely concerned with overall capital appreciation as long as my monthly income is enough to cover living expenses. For instance, if I can have a \~8% yield on cost on $750,000 I‚Äôm fine with that, rather than spending time building to 1.5M yielding 4%.

I want a simple ETF system I can continuously plug excess cash into to keep growing monthly income.Rather than investing purely in more growth oriented ETFs, I‚Äôm thinking of focusing mostly on Canadian and USA dividend aristocrat tracking ETFs with decent dividend growth rates, and just building that up with DRIP and new contributions over the next several years.Attached are some images that represent my estimated numbers.

I would be interested to hear your opinions on this strategy, rather than investing for capital growth, focus more on dividend growth over a medium time horizon.

My portfolio would hold ETFs like CDZ, HYLD, VEQT, XEI, and perhaps some VFV. If you look at the rough math, even the capital appreciation works out similar to a growth focus when you factor in DRIP. On top of that, if stocks go down, then DRIP just buys more for the money, increasing overall income.

Is there anything I‚Äôm missing or not considering?

As such, they make up a huge composition of market-weighted indices like the S&P and NASDAQ 100. Yesterday NVDA was up. Yesterday many other stocks were up.

Is there a causal relationship here?

It is clear that buying a stock within an index affects the index. It also clear that buying a fund that tracks the index also affects the stocks within the index. Every stock has a beta, which is the movement that can be explained via correlation to the overall market, and alpha, which is movement that is not explained via correlation to the overall market.

What I'm trying to understand is the nature of the relationship between NVDA vs indices ex-NVDA. Which of these is more true:

1) NDVA goes up -> causes indices to go up -> STOP. Movement in other stocks can be explained by other factors other than NVDA alone.

2) NVDA goes up -> causes indices to go up -> causes all stocks in the index to go up. A stock benefits simply by being tracked in the same index as NVDA,

Because this leads to an unintuitive conclusion in my head: given two stocks A and B that have zero alpha and high beta in unrelated sectors. News that affects the price of stock A causes an effect on the price stock B simply because of their beta values.",2024-02-23,0

Generally I'm looking to be 100% in index funds and match the annual performance of a major index like S&P or NASDAQ. 

So the 56% of my portfolio in value and small cap is dragging my overall performance as compared to S&P and NASDAQ.

I've changed my future contributions to buy 100% large cap growth. I'm comfortable with a DCA approach on my contributions.

I'm considering just holding my current assets until there is a dip in the large cap growth or a big spike in the value.

1825,The weird psychology of selling a portion of your stock,0,1ay2gua,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ay2gua/the_weird_psychology_of_selling_a_portion_of_your/,7,"On one hand when I sell a few shares, I want to see the price go down afterwards so I know I sold at a good time.

On the other hand, I still have stock invested, so I certainly want to see the price go up, whether I sell a portion of it or not.

So maybe it's always a win/win situation.  Or maybe always lose/lose?   Can it somehow always be neutral -- the price doesn't matter *at all* when you sell a small number of shares?  So confusing.

I suppose it depends on the % you sell -- for a small sale %, you still *always* root for the price to go up and never worry about selling a few at the right time.  Just sell and move on.   Only for a large sale % does it make sense to ""root"" for the price to go down.  But even then it feels wrong since I have some left still, even if it is a small amount.",2024-02-23,0

1827,The Rise of Old West Carson City Coins: A Digital Era Investment Opportunity,0,1ay01bj,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ay01bj/the_rise_of_old_west_carson_city_coins_a_digital/,2,"  
In the fast-paced world of digital transactions and virtual currencies, the allure of physical coins with historical significance is experiencing a resurgence. Among these coveted treasures are the Old West Carson City coins, particularly Morgan Dollars, Twenty Cent Pieces, and Trade Dollars. While these coins have long held value among numismatists and collectors, recent shifts in global currency dynamics are poised to exponentially increase their worth.  
  
As the world steadily progresses towards the widespread adoption of digital central bank currencies, the role of physical currency is undergoing a transformation. The elimination of physical currency is not merely a hypothetical scenario but an inevitable reality as governments and financial institutions embrace the efficiency and security offered by digital transactions.  
  
This seismic shift in currency dynamics will have profound implications for physical coins with historical significance, such as those minted in Carson City during the Old West era. As physical currency becomes increasingly scarce, the demand for tangible assets with intrinsic value has been  skyrocketing. Elite collectors and savvy investors alike are seeking out coins with rich historical narratives and tangible scarcity.  
  
Among the most sought-after Old West Carson City coins are Morgan Silver Dollars, with the highest demand for the CC-minted 1889 Morgan, CC-minted Twenty Cent Pieces, and CC-minted Trade Dollars. These coins, minted in limited quantities and imbued with the spirit of the Wild West era, hold a unique appeal for collectors and investors seeking tangible assets with enduring value.  
  
The distinctive ""CC"" mint mark, signifys their origin in the heart of the Old West.   
  
Twenty Cent Pieces minted in Carson City are prized for their rarity and historical significance. Minted for only a brief period from 1875 to 1878, these coins represent a fascinating chapter in American coinage history.  The Trade Dollars minted in Carson City are also poised to experience a surge in demand among elite collectors. These coins, originally minted for trade with China and other Asian markets, hold a unique place in American numismatic history. 

As the world adapts to digital central bank currencies attentive Investors are beginning to seek out tangible assets with historical significance, and it's driving demand and increasing their value to unprecedented heights. Unfortunately, this is an opportunity that many Investors will miss. While the opportunity is here and now for physical, tangible investments most Investors are looking in the wrong direction for new opportunities.

For context: I work for a telecom company, and in the past they have not offered stock option for employees. now, suddenly the company announced that they would offer stock purchase for employees because apparently ""many people voiced their request, and we heard"".

Here's the thing: from what I observed, the stock option doesn't give employees any type of discount for the purchase. Also, instead of letting employees purchase directly, the company is offering it through their retirement funds.

I felt that there's something wrong and looked up the company's stock performance, and in the past 5 years, the company's stock values has doubled between 2020 and 2021, but from then on it dropped back down to half its values from peak.

If you compare a common healthcare ETF, like VHT for instance vs the total stock market, the healthcare fund actually outperforms the total stock market and with less max drawdown. So better performance and less volatility. Will this outperformance continue? Maybe, maybe not.

https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&sl=5xXJ6wBNCXzqUi7OEIMyxu

However, the second part of this strategy is what makes it interesting: Investing solely in VHT in your HSA. The reasoning being if healthcare costs go up in the future, the main beneficiaries of that would be healthcare stocks. The gains in this would then be used to offset the cost of healthcare expenses in the future when you have to draw upon your HSA, probably retirement age or older.

It‚Äôs sort of a hedging strategy on healthcare costs. If the costs of healthcare goes up, the healthcare stocks benefit and your HSA will reap those benefits. If the costs of healthcare goes down or even extreme case, there‚Äôs universal healthcare, then the HSA is only a small part of your portfolio and you‚Äôll already be ahead by the lower costs of healthcare anyways.

1841,Gene Munster - Dan Nathan - Other Bear Nvidia Analysts Get This One Thing Wrong. There will be NO Glut Or Epic Fall - Nvidia is Now a Cloud Provider of Accelerated Compute,8,1axqdrd,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1axqdrd/gene_munster_dan_nathan_other_bear_nvidia/,22,"Gene was giving a great analysis of Nvidia potential headwinds into the future of this AI Super Cycle.  
  
<video here>  
  
The problem is I don't think these analyst are getting how Nvidia works which is weird because they literally have direct access to Jensen.  
  
I think the word ""Data Center"" is confusing. I think they believe that data center means something that is not cloud like but rather a super computer that is shipped to someone who then uses it in the cloud. And that's it they ship the hardware and Nvidia never sees them again.  
  
That's not what is going on here.  
  
First, Nvidia can direct sell you cloud like access to all their hardware and software services all by themselves.  
  
NVIDIA DGX Cloud is a serverless, AI-training-as-a-service platform for enterprises that depend on AI.  
  
With integrated best-in-class software, direct access to NVIDIA AI experts, and near-limitless access to high-performance compute, DGX Cloud delivers industry-leading utilization efficiency with scale and productive work capacity for developers‚Äîat the lowest TCO compared with traditional infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) approaches.  
  
Dan Nathan just seems either confused or just willfully attempting to rally a short position. I lean to the latter because I can't believe he is actually believing what he is saying but I could be wrong.  
  
Maybe Dan is just confused.  
  
Second, You can then access Nvidia with all of it's software and services FROM effectively a third party such as Azure or AWS. Why would someone go this route? The reason is many times companies have contracts in place to get discounted compute from 1 or 2 cloud providers. So, they sort of go all in with Microsoft Azure as an example. The legal and contract agreements are in place for the entire IT department to use ""whatever"" is in Azure. Well, if Nvidia cloud can be accessed in Azure that's great because all of the engineers and DS's can have access without going through and getting agreements in place for Nvidia directly.  
  
There is obviously the chance of more cost but for the lack of headache it is probably negligible. But, every situation is different. Point is, that is money that is going directly to Nvidia (and probably the serving cloud provider at some portion) because at that point Microsoft or AWS or Google is only a passthrough. This is very much the same for other provider as well such as MongoDB and Redis Labs.  
  
Now, on the other side Microsoft, X and AWS have every right to purchase, store and assemble their own solutions with purchased hardware from Nvidia and others and also provide and direct sale their own option.  
  
See that's the difference of HARDWARE sales and CLOUD INCOME. I haven't heard this on the conference calls and would be great if someone talked about it because it would become so much more clear. You must understand the distinction to understand Nvidia's current business model right now.  
  
Back to Gene. So the the mistake that everyone keeps making is that they're saying the BUST or the apocalypse MUST come for nvidia because once they sale all of the hardware then nobody is going to buy anymore. Thus the ""GLUT"".  
  
That's not how this is working. You have to get your mind out of the Crypto/NFT ponzi scheme to understand this.  
  
Crypto had a bunch of GPU's going up against a supply / demand model of increasing BitCoin price. When the bitcoin price crashed. Everyone holding a warehouse of GPU's costing millions in electricity suddenly didn't want to be a bitcoin miner anymore. Hence, a bunch of GPU's that nobody wanted. The ""GLUT"". This was probably max of Bitcoin falling to \~12000. It's also why ETH and others wanted to go to ASICS and get off the Bitcoin hype cycle.  
  
Nobody talks about AWS or Azure or Google's ""GLUT"" concern with bought servers and hardware. Nobody. AWS and Azure update their cloud server options all of the time. It's a natural cycle that is smooth and calculated.  
  
Why is it not conceivable that this will be similar for Nvidia?  
  
Everyone is trying to predict the day Nvidia falls instead of trying to think ""hmm"" maybe, just maybe, Nvidia is growing as a cloud offering with software, hardware and service. Sound like IaaS? Because it is.  
  
It's the same concept as general compute but with accelerated compute. The software stack is why you would go for Nvidia as opposed to using a different cloud provider native abstraction.  
  
MongoDB in Azure Cosmos is not as good as MongoDB direct to Mongo IN Azure. Or at least that might be a consideration for you.  
  
Speaking of Data storage companies one could make an analogy here.  
  
Data gets stored and then you access said data.  
  
LLM's get trained and then you access said LLM.  
  
The only difference is that the LLM needs compute to run it. Less than training compute but still accelerated compute.  
  
The training doesn't happen one time and that's it. You could train a model and it suck and then you have to retrain it. Or you need to update it so you have to retrain it.  
  
The money it cost to train is in the million's. multiple millions of dollars for foundational LLM's.  
  
There will be no more glut here than there is in any other cloud providers for general compute.  
  
There will not be a ""BUST"" this time. So don't worry Dan, you can come out of the shorts and join the rest of us into the future.",2024-02-23,0

I‚Äôm asking because, although they‚Äôre already risky, I noticed that they have insane gross/net expense ratios compared to ETFs, making them even more risky. 

Taking calculated, sensible risk that I can justify isn‚Äôt really something that typically bothers me, but this seems kind of like instead of mitigating my risk, I‚Äôm just hedging my risk with even more risk. On the bright side, the investment minimums are low, so that definitely counts as a positive! 

Does anyone have any thoughts? 
Some examples of the rates are below.

Fund 1 - $2500 minimum, 5.7%gross expense ratio / 2.9%net expense ratio

Fund 2: $2500 minimum, 6.74% gross expense ratio / 6.75% net expense ratio (so no discount here)

I took an investing course and these are generally the numbers that are good.

This is not an exhaustive list, but please reply in the comments with ratios I've missed, and what numbers we should be looking for so people can open this, and search the thread.

A good **Sharpe ratio** typically falls within the following ranges:  
  
Greater than 1.0: Considered acceptable to good by investors.  
Higher than 2.0: Rated as very good.  
3.0 or higher: Considered excellent.  
Under 1.0: Considered sub-optimal

**Beta** \- Measure of risk. A score of 1 matches the market. 1.5 means if the market moves 1, that stock moves 1.5. A score of 0.5 means if the market moves 1, it moves 0.5. Higher the number, the more volatility. 

A good **Treynor ratio** is typically higher than the market‚Äôs ratio, which serves as a benchmark. Historical data suggests that the market‚Äôs ratio is usually around 1.

**Price/earnings (P/E) ratio** \- Lower the better. Less than 2.5 is good.

**Price/sales (P/S) ratio** \- Lower the better. 1.0 - 2.0 is good. Less than 1, excellent.

**Price/Earnings/Growth (PEG) ratio** \- Below 1.0 is good value

**Price/book ratio** \- Range 1.0 - 3.0. Less than 1.0 is excellent.

**Enterprise Value/revenue ratio (EV/R)** \- Good is between 1.0 - 3.0. Lower is better.

**Enterprise value/ EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) (EV/EBITDA)** \- Less than 10. Lower is better.

**Price/cash flow (P/CF)** \- 10 or less. Lower is better

**Price/free cash flow (P/FCF)** \- 15 or less. Lower is better.

**Dividend payout ratio** \- Less than 50% excellent. 50-70% good. The higher, the more cautious you should be.",2024-02-22,0

I just wanted to have three threads in a row with Nvidia in the title. Though this title is taken directly from MarketWatch.

What I found fascinating about this article was how destructive the .com bubble was. That was in 2000-2001. Or 23ish years ago!  

The fact, I often brag about me being around, for that bubble, which gives me experience with it, and we‚Äôre still pulling metrics from that era

From MarketWatch:

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nvidia-fueled-tech-rally-puts-nasdaq-composite-record-in-sight-59951214?g=ad5aec42-f1a1-40d9-aa8d-ab928ce5fed8&mod=djem_mwnbulletin

> An Nvidia-led rally is helping to push the Nasdaq Composite toward rarefied territory, with the tech-heavy index near its first record close **in 27 months.**

> The Nasdaq Composite COMP was up 346 points, or 2.2%, at 15,927 Thursday morning, near its record close of 16,057.44 set on Nov. 19, 2021.

> If the Nasdaq were to finish above that threshold 16,057) Thursday, it would end a drought of **564 trading days without a record close,** according to Dow Jones Market Data. That‚Äôs the longest such stretch since a run of 3,801 trading days running from March 2000 to April 2015, following the bursting of the dot-com bubble.

Wow

> The other two major U.S. stock indexes ‚Äî the large-cap benchmark S&P 500 SPX and blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA ‚Äî have scored a string of records in early 2024.

> The Nasdaq‚Äôs long drought after the bursting of the tech bubble in 2000 left many investors particularly wary of declaring a return of the bull market after the index‚Äôs most recent slide. After all, the Nasdaq saw three rallies of 40% or more over the course of the bear market that followed the dot-com bust, with none marking the beginning of a lasting bull, 

There‚Äôs a lot of good points here. One that surprising is the fact that the NASDAQ composite hasn‚Äôt broken a record in over 500 days. 

Everyone is saying that technology is the only one benefiting from this bull market. But the NASDAQ, which is really tech heavy, has been under performing Dow and s&p. 

Another is like said: the .com bubble burst is still being felt today. And I wonder if a lot of people on this forum slamming Nvidia didn‚Äôt go through that bubble and now see anything similar and have Vietnam-like flashbacks and PTSD.

For individual stocks positions, however, I find myself struggling to hold on to EXTREMELY large winners, when I do have them. I know the phrase goes, ""water your flowers and cut your weeds"", or something like that. But for example, I've been trimming my meta position, which is currently up almost 200%.

I'm not asking for personal advice on one stock in particular, rather, how to be more comfortable with letting winners run. But perhaps I already am, since I held for so long, and am only worried now with how hyped the market is? 

Another thing, is cutting losses. On a few stocks, I'm down 20-30%, and while I'm not uncomfortable with holding where I see a positive future, in some companies I don't.

When would be the best time to roll this thing to Roth? Are there any strategies that would make this easier? Some considerations:

- The current size of the account is $12k. I could afford the taxes on that, but it would eat up nearly the entire raise I just got.

- The markets are at all-time highs. I know it would be best to roll when the markets are down, but there's no way to time a crash. The longer I wait to roll, the higher my tax bill could potentially get.

But, I ask, is it now not a good time to start? Interest rates are finally stable, and there is positive outlook for them to start going down. S&P is picking up and already reached peak levels. My only hesitation is TMF - has it really hit rock bottom or not? Is there a different asset we could replace TMF with, which we have confidence in, while still capturing the UPRO upside and allowing some hedging?

1882,Wealth advice I would give to my younger self,68,1ax2fmy,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ax2fmy/wealth_advice_i_would_give_to_my_younger_self/,29,"Here is some advice I would give to my younger self that I have distilled after a decade of starting my career. I still have a long way to go, but these are hard-earned learnings I thought of sharing. I will keep it as compass for remaining decades of my life. I hope, it can be of some help to you too in your own money journey.

**#1: Become financially educated.** Our schools and society don‚Äôt teach us much about money, so you must learn it yourself early on. Learn to earn, spend, manage, invest, and grow wealth. Personal finance is neither complex nor boring, so don‚Äôt outsource it. It only takes a bit of effort to master a few key ideas and practices. This little effort will massively reduce stress about money from your life.

**#2: Have a vision for yourself.** Plans don‚Äôt always work out the way we imagine, but being intentional helps. Visualize how your life would be like years and decades out. Your future image should come from a place deep inside of you, not from your ego. Don‚Äôt think of grandiose ideas about how big you will be one day. Instead, aim to be financially independent early so you can do things that add meaning to your life.

**#3: Choose right work.** Choose a profession where you can enjoy the work even when results are not visible in short-term. If you don‚Äôt know what that is, just follow your intuition. It‚Äôs your best guide. Don‚Äôt choose a role because it feels prestigious or offers little more money. It will take a long time to become at good at anything, so choose work that gives you energy. Getting this right is way more important than accumulating wealth.

**#4: Maximize your earnings.** Once you have chosen your craft, think about how you can maximize your earnings over time. Invest in yourself and over-index on learning new skills. Try to become a more valuable person each passing year. Most importantly, be in the right environment. There are certain markets‚Ää‚Äî‚Äälike different industries and geographies‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthat will compensate you much better for your skills. For instance, job in the Bay Area would pay a lot more for same engineering skills than most parts of the world. Make all effort to transition to the environment that‚Äôs best for you. That will compound your earnings, connections, and happiness in the long-term.

**#5: Spend way less than you earn.** There is no shame in living frugally, especially in early part of your career. Aim for savings rate north of 20%. If you do that, you will keep more and need less to be financially independent. Deeply ingrain the idea that happiness does not have a lot to do with money. Precious things in life are free anyways, be it spending time with loved ones or losing yourself in your craft.

**#6: Invest in fast growing assets.** You will become wealthy when you own assets that can grow fast in value, like real estate or stocks. Stocks are volatile, but easier to manage. Real estate is more stable, but requires oversight. If you don‚Äôt want to manage individual stocks, buy diversified index funds. The key is to buy and hold for the long-term and let the growth compound. Things that don‚Äôt generate cash, like gold and bitcoin, are speculative. Play around with it if you want, but don‚Äôt make it the centerpiece of your investing strategy.

**#7: Aim for a few big hits.** There are a few asymmetrical bets that can have massive payoff. You can start a company or a join an early-stage startup with equity. You can start a side business or become a creator to share useful content with the world. You can even invest in undervalued stocks or real estate. These bets can take many forms. The odds of success of any one is low, but you can try as many times as you want. All you need is one big hit to change your life.

**#8: Know what you are chasing.** Play your own game. Do not compare with others because someone will always be in a better spot. Know when and what is enough for you. Don‚Äôt obsessively chase a target net worth number. Don‚Äôt revolve your life around a spreadsheet. Instead, know how much you need so can design a life you want to live. You will get lasting happiness only when you travel on your own path. One that this universe has crafted just for you.",2024-02-22,0
1883,Nvidia‚Äôs sheer dominance can be summed up by this one underrated number,214,1awyoh4,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1awyoh4/nvidias_sheer_dominance_can_be_summed_up_by_this/,132,"My other Nvidia post got a lot of traction, so I thought I‚Äôd continue the Nvidia party. there‚Äôs been a lot of talk comparing them to Cisco back in the .com era. 

I lived through .com era and it was vastly different. If you said you were an online mall, you could get $1 billion the next day. Because people understood malls and this Internet thing was going to raise all roofs. 

Pets.com? I know what a pet is..com makes it even better!

I remember the exact street I was driving on when the one trillionth radio advertisement for Amazon came on the radio. And I was like, what a stupid name for a bookstore. Amazon has nothing to do with books. And for years and years and years, Amazon, lost money. They only existed because that.com Bubble had lifted them so far they had Cash. Lotsa cash. But they were a joke for about a decade.

But the real big thing was almost none of those companies had a profit. They didn‚Äôt make any money whatsoever. None. No business. They were burning through cash with expensive offices, expensive staff, oh man, salaries for tech workers were astronomical.

The companies that did have a profit, we‚Äôre making pennies. Or there profit margins were incredibly slim. There were only handfuls of companies that were catapulted by the bubble that didn‚Äôt meet this criteria.

Cisco was in a similar situation to Nvidia. Cisco built the tools that would enable this tremendous new technology. but their net profit margin was like 17%. Vastly less than nvidias. Nvidia forward p/e is 54. Ciscos was 150.

If it‚Äôs a bubble, it‚Äôs nowhere near the size of the.com bubble. S&P 500 is P/E of 22. In 2000 it was 28.

I think I‚Äôd like to retire at 55-60 years old. I currently do not have any debt(no car payment, I always pay my cc each month, student loans paid for, and no mortgage). I do not own, I rent. It‚Äôs expensive where I am and at this point I don‚Äôt have a 20% down payment for a home - plus the homes where I live are just beyond outrageous. I think I‚Äôm fine renting for awhile. 

I am contributing 10% of my income to my 401K. Currently around 70K in there. I obviously didn‚Äôt always contribute that much but I‚Äôve made more money over the years as I‚Äôve moved up with my company.  They match 6%. I am considering bumping this up even more - probably 15 percent which is still a little below max contribution but my commission can vary so I want to be cautious. I also am almost making too much money for a Roth IRA. 

I am a part of an Employee stock purchase plan which offers stock at a discount and have been contributing 5% of my paycheck for the last almost 7 years. I also have received RSUs each year and am receiving even more per year with a promotion. So total value of this is 71K with a potential value of 18K that hasn‚Äôt vested yet - and more RSUs to come each year. 

A few years ago I started a health savings account. Currently only putting in what my company matches which is $750. So that‚Äôs 1500 a year. I‚Äôve not invested any of this but am considering it. I have about 5K in there. 

After just staring at my dividends and unsure what to do with them (probably should have reinvested but whatever ü´†) I decided to use them to buy 6 shares of the ETF ITOT. I‚Äôm going to start off with 100 bucks a month into this but want to see how increasing my 401K contributions plays out financially first. The ETF world is a little new to me. Just starting out. A lot of my 401K is invested in vanguard so I figured it would be good to do an ETF that wasn‚Äôt vanguard for diversification reasons? This could be inaccurate thinking so open to feedback here. 

I‚Äôve been saving since I got my job 7 years ago. I use to make much less so it‚Äôs been an up hill climb. But I have 26 grand in savings which I feel is a little disappointing. I have also just never really heard of a High Yield Savings account until recently so I just moved everything over and started saving in that account last year. I was putting around 250 a paycheck in there for around 6 years (having to dip in occasionally for unexpected vet or car bills for example). If my commission checks were a lot and I had left over pay I‚Äôd just send it over to the savings account. I now put around 600-1000 a month in the savings account depending on commission checks. I know it will grow faster because my contribution amount has increased recently but idk not feeling great about it. 

But anyways - is this a good place to be financially? Any advice at all? I‚Äôm always over fixating and worrying I‚Äôm not doing enough.  ",2024-02-22,0

1894,Matt Levine (Bloomberg) on the upcoming reddit IPO,30,1awqkqx,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1awqkqx/matt_levine_bloomberg_on_the_upcoming_reddit_ipo/,36,"Matt Levine is alway funny and interesting and he hits on all the pluses and the many minuses regarding the reddit IPO and the supposed offer to some redditors. The thing about reddit is that it is just that, reddit. There isn't much of a moat, just ask the Digg guys how that went.


I guess there are three ways to look at this:

Reddit plans to place a big chunk of its IPO shares in the hands of its users, an unusual move that could build loyalty but also comes with risk. 

The company plans to reserve an as-yet-undetermined number of shares for 75,000 of its most prolific so-called redditors when it goes public next month, according to people familiar with the matter. The users will have the opportunity to buy Reddit shares at its initial public offering price before the stock starts trading, a privilege normally reserved only for big investors. 

Ideally for the company and its underwriters, Reddit shares will rise in their stock-market debut, bestowing big gains on those who buy in at the IPO price. If the stock falls, however, it could anger those members of Reddit‚Äôs community ‚Äî a group that, broadly speaking, hasn‚Äôt shied away from boycotts in the past.

Banks generally favor selling the bulk of an IPO to big money managers that tend to hold stocks for a relatively long time. Individual investors are viewed as more fickle and prone to selling at the first sign of weakness.

One is the sort of philosophical view. Reddit Inc., more so even than most social media companies, is a publisher that doesn‚Äôt pay its writers and editors. It runs a website that publishes huge amounts of content on various message boards; the boards are mostly moderated by volunteers and the content is written by users. From this, Reddit generates hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue from ads and data. For the most part, the users do not really share in that revenue.

This model works fine ‚Äî It is in fact the case that the users happily post and moderate on Reddit without getting paid! There is no need to pay them! ‚Äî but it is awkward, particularly when an initial public offering is set to value the company at more than $5 billion. ‚ÄúWe created $5 billion of value and get none of it,‚Äù some redditors will probably complain. Letting them buy stock at the IPO price doesn‚Äôt really address that complaint ‚Äî they still have to pay for it! ‚Äî but it sort of symbolically responds to it. ‚ÄúWe let our users share in our success, by paying full price for the stock,‚Äù Reddit can say; it‚Äôs fine, whatever.[1]

The second is the conventional capital markets view. Here, the rough idea is that banks sell the stock in an IPO mostly to big institutional investors, most of whom they expect to buy and hold the stock. Then the next day, the stock opens for trading, and lots of people ‚Äî institutions that didn‚Äôt get allocations, but also retail investors ‚Äî want to buy it. But there‚Äôs not a lot for sale, because most of the IPO was placed with long-term holders. So there‚Äôs a lot of demand and not much supply, so the stock goes up, creating an ‚ÄúIPO pop.‚Äù This means that it is generally good to get an allocation in the IPO: You buy stock in the IPO, and the next day it reasonably predictably goes up and you make money. And retail investors mostly don‚Äôt get to buy a lot of stock in IPOs, so they miss out on this pop.

Letting individual redditors buy stock in the IPO sort of addresses this problem: The redditors get to buy stock at the institutional price, and then it goes up and they make money. On the other hand, if you let the retail investors buy in the IPO, that kind of ruins the mechanism that leads to the IPO pop? The devoted retail investors who want to buy the stock do so in the IPO, rather than having to wait until the next day, so there‚Äôs not as much demand when the stock opens for trading. And a lot of those retail investors might be looking to make a quick buck by flipping the stock, so there is more supply. So there‚Äôs less reason to expect a pop. ‚ÄúIf everyone buys at the IPO price then there‚Äôll be no one waiting to buy it the next day,‚Äù I wrote, when Robinhood Markerts Inc. tried this sort of thing, ‚Äúand everyone who bought it to make a quick profit will be selling it at a loss.‚Äù (That did happen to Robinhood, though then it rallied hard the week after its IPO, so who knows.)

The third is the meme-stock corporate finance view. Most companies are mostly owned by big institutional investors, there are fairly traditional ways to keep those investors happy (steadily increasing earnings, clear communications, stock buybacks, etc.), keeping those investors happy keeps the stock price up, and a high stock price is good for the executives (who get paid largely in stock) and for the company (if it ever needs to raise money by selling more stock). But in the 2020s, some companies are owned in large part by retail investors, and some of those investors are more interested in being part of an online community of investors, and trading jokes and memes, than they are in financial analysis. And you can make those investors happy in less traditional ways, like by giving them popcorn or buying a gold mine or doing a YouTube interview with no pants on.

Lots of corporate executives want nothing to do with this, but some executives lean into it. And why not? Sometimes companies (1) need to raise money (because their business is in trouble) and (2) can‚Äôt do the traditional things that make investors happy (because their business is in trouble). Having some source of funding that is orthogonal to traditional business success seems like a good insurance policy: ‚ÄúIf our business ever gets into trouble and we need money, we can always make some jokes with our retail investors and they‚Äôll give us the money.‚Äù 

Not every company can get meme-stock investors. But you know who probably can? The whole idea of meme stocks originates with Reddit; Reddit‚Äôs boards are where the great meme stocks were created; Reddit is where the online communities of investors are. Surely Reddit has some advantages in appealing to retail investors on Reddit. It might as well get some of them in its stock early.",2024-02-21,0

So excuse me if it becomes a duplicate. But I figured this would be of interest to people because Nvidia has been the poster child for whether or not this is an AI bubble.

I think everyone was taking wait-and-see on their earnings. And the naysayers would be able to point to missed expectations as a sign that this is a bubble.

> Revenue came in at $22.1 billion, up from $6.05 billion a year before, while analysts had been modeling $20.4 billion.

> Data-center revenue at Nvidia NVDA rocketed more than 400% from a year before to hit $18.4 billion, while the FactSet consensus was for $17.06 billion.

> Nvidia forecasts continued strong growth for the ongoing quarter, well above expectations. The company is calling for $24.0 billion in revenue, up from $7.2 billion a year prior, while analysts were modeling $22.2 billion.

> Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point,‚Äù Chief Executive Jensen Huang said in a release. ‚ÄúDemand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations.‚Äù

> Nvidia posted fiscal fourth-quarter net income of $12.3 billion, or $4.93 a share, compared with $1.4 billion, or 57 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $5.16 a share, while analysts were projecting $4.59 a share.

I own Nvidia, so I admit, I am biased. But I think anyway you slice those numbers, they‚Äôre pretty damn impressive. If it‚Äôs a bubble, it‚Äôs a bubble that people are buying into. And by people, I mean, giant, multinational companies. It‚Äôs amazing growth for a company so large. 

I‚Äôm hoping this brings some calm back to the markets. We‚Äôve been pivoting between irrational exuberance and panic.

**EDIT**: it is the next day, and the results are in. My personal account earned 27.9% TODAY. That is from 2 NVDA options and 1 SMCI option. My larger retirement account made 11.2% today based on NVDA stock SMCI stock NVDA option and lots of ETFs. Probably no one will see this edit.

I am 63 years old and I have a few investment questions I‚Äôm hoping this community can help me with. I would like to invest 50k with a hard money real estate lender, expecting a projected return of 8-11% per year.

I have three sources that I could use for the investment:
1.) A self directed IRA (SDIRA)
2.) 401k
3.) Edward Jones account

My money accounts are invested 65/35 in age appropriate investments. I would try to keep the ratio the same using the conservative money from those accounts.

My questions are as follows:

1.) Do they withhold taxes at the time of the withdrawal from 401k and Ed Jones?

1a.) If so, how much would I have to withdraw to net 50k? I‚Äôm in the 24% tax bracket.

2.) One CPA advised against using SDIRA money. I believe it creates a UBIT tax? Not sure what that is but other than that I‚Äôm not sure why.

3.) Is it a bad idea to withdraw the money now at my age? It will be reinvested conservatively.

I have land near a hospital, and I'm considering what would be the best use for it.  
Given its proximity to a healthcare facility, the location seems prime for something that could serve hospital visitors or staff. Currently, the land is zoned for commercial use, but I've been toying with the idea of getting it rezoned for residential purposes. The thought process here is to potentially build apartments which could be really convenient for hospital employees or those with loved ones in long-term care.  
The question I'm grappling with is whether the rezoning effort, which I know can be quite a process, would be worth the potential gains. Apartments could fill a real need, providing housing solutions right where people work or visit frequently. On the flip side, keeping it commercial could also present opportunities for businesses that complement the hospital's services. Any advice is appreciated!",2024-02-21,0

I've done some research and searched old posts but haven't found myself grasping the considerations around rolling over my old employer 401k.

Situation is as follows:

I have a Traditional 401(k) at T. Rowe Price from an old employer, balance is around $75k with $65k being contributions and $10k earnings.

The rest of my retirement accounts are at Vanguard, where I have two 401(k)'s from previous employers, a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA. The Traditional and Roth IRAs at Vanguard are used for backdoor Roth each year, as our income is over the limit for directly contributing to Roth IRA.

My goal is to simplify life by moving the 401(k) to Vanguard. As best I can tell, I'm paying $36/yr in fees to T. Rowe Price at the moment. I am currently not employed and so do not have an active employer 401(k) that could accept the rollover from T. Rowe Price 401(k).

I have read that high income earners should not rollover a 401(k) to a Traditional IRA because of the IRS pro-rata rule impacting backdoor Roth IRA, though I can't say I could explain why that is. However, I do know that I want to continue doing backdoor Roth IRA each year for the next 20 years or so.

I am considering rolling over the T. Rowe Price Traditional 401(k) to a Roth IRA and taking the income tax hit on the $75k now, in order to get 20+ years of tax-free growth in the years ahead. In this case, would I still run into issues with future backdoor Roth IRA contributions and the IRS pro-rata rule?

TLDR: If I convert a Traditional 401(k) from an old employer to a Roth IRA, will it compromise my ability to do future backdoor Roth IRA contributions?

Thanks for reading, any advice appreciated.

Edit: For the folks commenting that now is good time to do Roth conversion since I am not working, I should have mentioned that my spouse is a high earner and we expect our joint earnings to be at our current income level or higher in future years.",2024-02-21,0

So I'll start by saying that I'm a complete rookie on this. With this post, I merely intend to throw my thoughts out there to be challenged so I can learn from you guys.

From a geopolitical point of view, Intel strikes me as the ideal solution to the West. But their stubbornness over the last two decades has been a huge disappointment for the industry. Delays, reduced reliability, unfulfilled promises, and an overall loss of trust from pretty much everyone. If I'm not mistaken, that has been the consequence of poor management and the refusal to explore either fabless chip design or to spin out the Fab as a service business.

From what I've been reading, Nvidia and AMD have managed to get better chips, not because they have been better at designing them, but because the increased efficiencies of TSMC allowed them to go for lower nm.

If I understand this correctly, TSMC managed to get more efficient than Intel at manufacturing chips mostly for a couple of reasons: Taiwan's government subsidies and economies of scale. Functioning as a service that fabless chip designers could use to produce their chips has caused TSMC to engage in *a lot* more volume of chip manufacturing, as it's logical. That allows the economies of scale to kick in and make the processes more efficient. That paired with huge government support has the manufacturing at TSMC substantially more efficient than the one at Intel.

Now TSMC is 100% based in Taiwan, which is a geopolitical ticking bomb. And everyone is now scrambling to diversify their way as far away from China and Taiwan as they can. I guess the Chips Act is the most obvious move from the US government in that direction. This is prompting Samsung and TSMC to invest in opening new fabs in the US. Europe seems to be in a similar direction, but perhaps with milder strokes.

[I'm reading](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/165c0mq/they_would_not_listen_to_us_inside_arizonas/) that TSMC is struggling to replicate its way of doing business in the US. That should pose a problem to the political move the Chips Act intended.

But I haven't mentioned Intel. They have experience in opening and managing fabs on American soil. They have obvious support from the American government and they have now embraced the idea of offering their fabbing services to fabless chip designers - which from my understanding should make their processes substantially more competitive.

Now my conclusion of this whole thing is that Intel's success at spinning out new fabs that benefit from economies of scale is the key to this whole geopolitical knot. Maybe Samsung is another key player in this? I can sense there's *a lot* I'm not understanding or missing but I can't point my finger at what is it. Maybe someone over here can educate me a bit.",2024-02-21,0
1911,CNBC Market Coverage Overview,0,1awhjkz,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1awhjkz/cnbc_market_coverage_overview/,8,"The trading platform my work uses only has CNBC and no Bloomberg so I‚Äôm forced to watch it and here is what I have found. Thought I would share:

Squawk Box: Good show and often has the best guests. Andrew Ross Sorkin and Joe Kernen are both solid interviewers but polar opposites. Andrew is a bit more liberal while Joe is a bit more conservative, they mix well together and Becky provides a good buffer between the two

Squawk on the Street/Money Movers: Good show but it is basically Cramers show. Carl doesn‚Äôt do much other than read a headline and let Jim rant. Faber is mostly a M&A guy and doesn‚Äôt provide much when acquisitions are slow (like now). Faber is a bachelor who when asked what his favorite part about being on CNBC said is that he gets to go to Saks and pick out suits and CNBC pays for it all. After the first hour, Sara Eisen replaces Jim. And stays on until Wapner and Halftime. Sara is very meh, not great but not awful. While Jim is very focused on individual stocks, Sara is more macro and provides some decent color. You‚Äôll see a lot of good interviews during these times but it‚Äôs mostly just CEO‚Äôs talking up their companies or activists/short sellers just advertising their positions so be weary.


Jim Cramer: Ok Cramer gets his own section for obvious reasons. A lot of people give Cramer a hard time but I like the guy and think he truly means well and wants to help people. The thing is, is that when you spend years talking about stocks all day, you‚Äôre going to be wrong sometimes and he has been wrong and people seem to amplify them and forget about his winners. Nevertheless, the guy is clearly smart (Harvard, Goldman, Hedge Fund) and super well connected and gets great CEOs and guests on Squawk (and Mad Money) despite often asking really tough and direct questions. He is also funny and is able to provide you a good Birds Eye view of companies that are trending that you would otherwise not care about. People say he only talks about stocks he owns and that is true but on purpose as that is what his whole hedge fund strategy was built on before he went on TV. The guy would just talk up stocks he owned to analysts in the 90s and those analysts would talk about the stock, causing people to flock in and the price to rise. Overall, I think Cramer gets a bad rap given what he provides, that‚Äôs not to say he is perfect or to take anything he says to your brokerage account but he definitely does not deserve an entire inverse etf

Halftime Report: I usually turn off the sound here as this segment can get annoying. Wapner is alright and can often challenge the guests but it‚Äôs hard to tell if I like him as the guests are just abysmal. Most of the guests just like to hear themselves talk. Josh Brown thinks he is Warren Buffet and Scott will never challenge him. Joe T has an etf. If you didn‚Äôt know, dont worry, he will mention it multiple times. Stephanie Link just never stops talking. Some of the other guests are good but they can never get a word in because those three love to talk and Scott never interrupts them. Overall, the segment is very foggy as many of the guests are trying to sell themselves/the funds or companies they work for so it can be hard to take anything away from what they say without a large grain of salt that they have other motives for advertising their positions

Power Lunch: I really like this segment as both Kelly and Tyler are laidback and not too serious. No good guests but you often see a lot of interesting stories that aren‚Äôt as widely covered. Not much to this part but a good listen as the trading day winds down

Closing Bell: Another solid segment as Scott is good here and the guests are often solid. Nothing too exciting but a good end of the day wrap up.

I usually turn it off after closing bell so can‚Äôt provide much color after that but thought I would share my two sense on CNBC market coverage throughout the trading day",2024-02-21,0

It seems to me like the following two things cannot be true at the same time:

1. The market will efficiently price individual companies based on their ability to gain value.

2. The best way for capital to gain value is to buy and hold an index that reflects the market and is agnostic to individual companies. 

Eventually, if point #2 holds true, actively managed funds will become weaker and weaker, until everybody is just pouring money into market indexes. 

If point #1 holds true, then it seems like the entire modern investing paradigm of ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt beat the market‚Äù is wrong. Perhaps actively managed funds will beat the market in the VERY long run, even if most of them have failed to do so in the last couple decades.

1922,Thoughts on stock of employee-owned company. ,0,1aw9ckm,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1aw9ckm/thoughts_on_stock_of_employeeowned_company/,4,"What are your thoughts on buying employee-owned company shares? I currently work in such a company that is well established and the stock has been beating the market for over 10 years now. My understanding is that this all comes from 3rd party audits since it is not on the open market. 

If you are in this situation, what did you do? Buying year to year seems like a bad strategy if you have cash on hand because if it keeps going up, you are just paying more for it next year. Of course it could be heading for a cliff and when a company is large enough, you hardly have any better perspective on its future prospects than when looking at a public company (unless you are really high up).

1925,Stockanalysis on Zalando - Europe E-Commerce Player,5,1aw6pkf,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1aw6pkf/stockanalysis_on_zalando_europe_ecommerce_player/,3,"Hi Guys, please mention any flaw you see in my reasoning on the stock or in the numbers I mention, because I know humans are not perfect, especially me.

So Zalando is an E-Commerce Marketplace in Europe and they specialize in Fashion, while having about 7.000 Brands and over 1.8 Million Items on their Plattform.

Every Number i mentioned can be checked on the zalando investor relations website

Strategy:

So the company has a Revenue of about 10.5 Billion in LTM and a GMV of about 14.76. Right now around 40% of their GMV comes from third-parties and they try to execute the same strategy as Amazon is doing right now, which is selling less of their own fashion, which means the GMV should be growing faster than the revenue and the gross Margin should rise.

(Generally i think this development can be seen especially in E-Commerce Marketplaces, due to the E-Commerce Buisness being not that interesting, because of low barriers of entry, with Amazon FBA and Shopify, and not many Synergieeffects, resulting from taking different E-Commerce shops together. Here the only good Differentiations are good reviews or a Brand that people remember, which often goes together. But that just on the side.)

Also like Amazon they provide a Fullfillmentsolution to their Partners, which is also growing in the adoption of the third-party-sales on Zalando. Another interesting area is their acquisition of Highsnobiety, which provides a Fashion Newsfeed, that could enhance Sales through the Inputs provided by the News and could further enhance time spent on the Zalando website and App, which improves customerconnection and Sales.

I even think, that a Marketplace in the fashion e-commerce space should be even more interesting as a buisness model, than amazons marketplace model right now, due to the higher margins on the products, which can also lead to way higher comissions, than Amazon can charge for 10 meters of tape or something like that. So Zalando can maybe profit from their partners brands and the differentiation, that comes with them.

Financials and Macro:

So even though the strategy sounds pretty good, the numbers haven't performed in the same way. This is mostly due to 2022 and 2023 being pretty rough years for E-Commerce, due to people shopping a bit more in the real world again and mostly just the macro being much worse in general. The problem with fashion is, that it is very cyclical, because these expenses aren't life preserving and can easily be cut back a bit. Furthermore nearly all big fashion players in Europe, like About You, Asos and so on orderd way to much inventory in 2021, because they thought the E-Commerce trend would go on like in the covid times. (This can be seen pretty nicely, when visiting the $YOU ticker for About you or the $ZAL for Zalando and looking on the inventory as a percantage of revenue. - which should, with Zalando getting more of their revenue through comissions and other revenue streams, decrese -

These Problems caused Zalandos GMV to shrink right now with -2.5 %, with active customers in LTM also shrinking Q on Q. However this has to be seen relative to industrie peers, for example Asos shrinking -10 % or boohoo also - 10% and About you also slightly shrinking with -0.5%. So here you can see Zalando and About you taking performing way better than the rest of the European e-commerce market.

A Development which is especially linked to the high inventory levels is way lower gross margin, visible at every of the before mentioned companies. This comes from every Fashionshop trying to sell their inventory off, because they want to avoid big depreciation and amortization expenses. However this process is now close to being done, with many of the mentioned e-commerce shops having way healthier inventory numbers. So I don't see any reason, why the gross margins shouldn't climb back to the levels we saw before the last two years, which would be at Zalando from around 38% on average to about 42%.

So just this effect could get margins from around 2 % for the full year up to 6 %. Furthermore Zalando would, if their GMV grows at the 8% Cagr, that is predicted for E-commerce in Europe till 2029, certainly increase their operating margin to maybe 8-10 % with an Operating leverage (revenues growing with 4-6 %) and more profitable revenue thorough comissions and services for their third-party-sales. And the numbers mentioned are in my opinion quite conservativly estimated.

Now to their Balance Sheet: They have

around 2.2 billion in equity, however this surplus could be lower if they still have problems to sell their slightly elevated inventory levels, so we rather say 2 billion adjusting for the risk.

Market Cap: 5.17 Billion

So you would pay around a 0.3 Price to Revenue multiple if you subtract the equity from their market cap, but mostly you can't do this exactly, because the equity won't return around 7 % year on year(as the msci world), so we say it's rather a 0.4 price revenue multiple. So you pay a 0.4 revenue multiple, for the biggest Fashionmarketplace in Europe, where the market is estimated to grow around 8 % on average y on y to 2029 and the operating margin of Zalando can be expected to increase from the 2 % right now very fast to around 6 %, and long term to 8-10 %. with a 6 % operating margin you would pay around 7 times earnings(with 10 billion in revenues) for this very likely growing buisness, with further margin improvement to go.

Risks:

The most important risk i see comes of course from Asia, with Temu and Shein. They just produce with much lower costs than the brands in Europe and sell to much lower prices. However i think that especially in Europe there is still a big interest in owning and wearing brandclothes and another trend which further supports this trend is people more and more expressing themselves through clothes. So surely Temu and Shein will take some share, but more from Shops like H & M and less from Fashion Brands.

Of course many people would also think, that amazon will just also take the fashion e-commercemarket very easily, however i think, that people want a special place for buying their brand clothes and don't want to search bar for their product of choice. More and more of the sales will be impuls sales, with the customers scrolling through the app at a busstop and just buying something that they like, which is not possible with amazon, due to their big supply of many other things, than brand clothing.

Another risk is, that the macro enviroment right now is much worse and the DACH Market where around 45 % of their revenue lies, is growing a bit slower than the 8 % Cagr in Europe. Even though this is possible, their DACH-Market already is very profitable, with a 6 % operating margin despite the way lower gross margin, so the very likely higher growth rate in their rest of europe department could lead to higher Operating margins here, due to more growth and the operating leverage, that comes with it.

So i think most of the European e-commerce stocks are really undervalued and even though we won't see the growth rates from the covid e-commerce hype, these buisnesses will still grow at very decent rates and should further improve their profitability, which makes Zalando in my opinion a good investment.",2024-02-21,0
1926,How to save to retire early? Would you start saving to retire early even if you enjoy the work or would you keep grinding?,0,1aw560f,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1aw560f/how_to_save_to_retire_early_would_you_start/,19,"Main question is how to properly save for early retirement? Also what would you do In my shoes?

Long story short I worked my ass off and have been quite lucky. I have an accountant and I'll talk with him more about this when I go do my taxes as well but I'm mid 20s and have a business with 5 employees.

I take a salary of 70k. I work a ton so the math on the hours isn't great but I'm frugal and for now enjoy the work. Anyway it's all under an LLC right now and after all the business expenses are taken care of I'm still having about 12-15k a month left over. Currently my business account has a bit too much cash just sitting there.The business is in construction and while I don't want to scale this much more I have thought about branching out, outright building houses. Coupled with this I could take my lifestyle up a notch or two. Like I said not flashy but I do think I'd enjoy traveling more and traveling rich(er).

Or I up my salary start investing tons of money and retire early. Like forties. I could probably hire someone to run day to day but the hours are crazy bouncing between jobs and would realistically need 2 people. So it'd cost me a lot more than the 70k I pay myself. Would need a good nestegg saved up. 

What would you do? Right now leaning towards a soft retirement in my late 30s early 40s. Would hire someone to share the load of management but would still work some. If i start saving to retire early any pitfalls I should be aware of? Currently just have a Roth I'm contributing the max to which is all mutual funds and an account with about 50k in single stocks (thanks Nvidia lol). Also have like 12k in crypto.

And before anyone says anything I pay my guys well above market rate and give good bonuses I just got really lucky with some long term contracts (who you know who you blow).

I have a TDF for  2050 (26 years away) so I haven‚Äôt checked on it in a while.   It‚Äôs supposed to be ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù at this stage and since the S&P 500 is up 25% in the last year, that‚Äôs what I expected to see when I just looked.  Nope, 11% growth.   Turns out this fund is in the bottom 22% percentile of its morning star category.  

I don‚Äôt understand why TDF‚Äôs are being so risk averse when the date is 26 years away.  I know US stocks have not ALWAYS outperformed international stocks but aren‚Äôt we paying a fee for them to keep their finger on the pulse and adjust accordingly?

I know TDF‚Äôs are popular here but I just don‚Äôt understand how it could underperform so badly.   This one year (13% in lost gains) probably set my retirement back 3-4 years. 

Edit:  just so you all don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ONLY looking at the last 1 year:

My TDF annual return over the last 10 years is 8.5%

S&P is 12%

So that‚Äôs a difference of 3.5% annually over 10 years which realllly adds up.   Basically my retirement portfolio would be 40% higher than it is now.

2nd Edit:  since this TDF‚Äôs inception in 2007, its annual return has been 6%.   S&P 500 over this time is 9%.  So 1.5x the returns.   This time period obviously includes the 2008 recession and S&P 500 is still waaay better.  ",2024-02-20,0

I'm unsure why the market would just go about and assume that rate cuts ""had to happen"" and price in 7 rate cuts, when the fact is this is an election year. The Federal Reserve claims to have no part in our political system, so I don't understand why they would want to give any perceptions or assumptions of anything going on until after the election in November is finished? 

&#x200B;

To me it seems pretty clear cut that unless something breaks significantly (large bank failures such as JP Morgan or Capital One or Wells Fargo, etc) - that there is no reason to lower interest rates until after the election. Inflation is still a big question. YoY CPI is around 3% but inflation is still 20-25% since 2020. The economy is ""booming"" if you take the jobs reports to be truthful. And in may ways if we find out the jobs numbers are lies, the market could react by having a huge surge which would cause more inflation. 

  
Europe and China are in recession, but that's no reason for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates in the U.S. Like Bloomberg said all of last year - we have a case of American Exceptionalism here. 

&#x200B;

I think the stock market at best will be flat all year while people start to realize those rate cuts are not happening. Next year we may have a crash after the election is decided when they cut rates and it creates the ""perception"" that something is broken, even if nothing is ""broken,"" per-se.",2024-02-20,0

I've hopefully done most of the legwork. I am shopping for a savings product to stash a down payment. Savings window is probably a few years. I am currently in the Fidelity (brokerage), BOA (checking/Merrill Lynch brokerage), and American Express (card) ecosystems, and would prefer to stay there for my sanity, but y'know. 

Leading candidates are:

* FDLXX (doesn't accrue state/local tax?), currently at 4.94% w/ a .42% ER   

* BOA‚Äôs preferred deposit currently at 4.92%  


Seems like BOA PD‚Äôs is better for my situation:   
‚Ä¢	Looking at the cons: $100k entry is fine for me, 5 days or however much to withdraw is fine, clunkiness is a bummer but comparable to having to transfer from Fidelity to BOA anyway. I'd have to pay fed and state income taxes on the yield, vs. FDLXX paying fed gains and fed income taxes, and gains are both a lower rate and less likely to happen, which is a bummer. 9.3% CA tax on income means BOA‚Äôs rate is more like 4.46%.  
‚Ä¢	Pros: But BOA PD is easier to access in BOA ecosystem, counts toward preferred rewards, and avoids FDLXX's .42% MER which makes its yield more like 4.5% - whatever minimal gains. Do MMFs even make gains? Plus HYSA‚Äôs historically bottom out around 1% and often reach the 2s, while MMFs were \~0 in 2015, 16, 20, 21. Obviously you can move the money, but this is set and forget value.  
  
Also saw treasuries and municipal bonds and TIPS recommended for my sitch. See a huge selection of ML MMFs that kind of have me overwhelmed. Open to any suggestions there/tips on comparing.

1. I use the Robinhood account strictly for ETFs only. Currently contributing $2,000 a month..
2. I use the WeBull Account strictly for Individual Stocks only. Currently Contributing $500 a month. I purchase fractional shares for every $500 split between 14 different stocks. I do this to maintain an 80/20 ratio between ETFs and Stocks.
3. I contribute $500 a month to my Roth IRA account and buy ETFs only. Any dividends received from the Robinhood and WeBull accounts will go to the Roth IRA to help achieve the annual contribution limit.
4. My company contributes a percentage of my earnings during their fiscal year. I calculated their annual contribution to average a minimum of $580 a month to my Pre-Tax 401(k). Their match is tied to my earnings during their fiscal year so I expect my company's monthly contribution to increase by a few dollars every year.

In total, I'm working with roughly $3,500 a month to investments. I paid off all debts and started the year with roughly 20k between all 4 accounts. I'd need to average at least 14.15% of growth over the next 10 years so that I break a million by January 2034. If this were possible, how could I achieve this? Should I adjust my ETF:Stock Ratio to 70/30 so that I can achieve a higher growth?

Quick rundown, I have a normal day job w/access to health insurance and a 401k and also fund a roth IRA. I use IBKR and about 85% of my trading (about 3-4 round trips/month) is futures trades with the other 15% being options and etfs. 

So I DO NOT qualify anywhere near the 720 trades a year to make it to TTS status and if I understand that is the ONLY way I could look at writing off various legitimate trading expenses (home office, internet, etc.). 

I do beleive however if I do some sort of business for trading I may be able to get access to other retirement accounts (sep IRa?) that I may be able to shuttle more tax advantaged money tothus shortening my retirement timeline (not getting around minimum age but hope to be more ""ready"" by then). I don't know what other things could actually be considered a write off, you hear the joke about talking about ""business"" over lunch it has now become a tax write-off, not looking to do anything not legitimate but seems there are some advantages out there the average person can't do not owning a business.

I'm a fairly new UK investor and I was wondering what the pros/cons are of Hargreaves Lansdown, Vanguard and Fidelity for someone like me.

I'll be mostly investing in index funds/ETFs.

I've had an account with HL for a couple of years, more for ease than anything else. However, it's increasingly the case that I see funds recommended that aren't available there.

Is Vanguard better for fund availability, and is it worth opening an account with them for wider scope?

I also have an account with Fidelity from way back when. They also seem to offer a wider range of funds, as well as being open to crypto ETFs (this probably isn't the space for that debate, but I admire their flexibility vs Vanguard's stance). However, I'm put off by their trading fees, which seem high.

I'm aware that HL fees can be high, but as I only really deal in index funds and not stocks, and tend to choose funds with lower ongoing fees, that seems to offset the problem.

My question is:  What formally determines if a financial advisor or brokerage (anyone for that matter) has a fiduciary responsibility towards the client?

Is this responsibility actually called out explicitly  in an agreement or contract that's signed?  Is it mandated by law in certain cases?  Does the expression ""fiduciary responsibility"" actual appear in a document?

The reason I ask it that I once had my IRA with a certain financial advisor.  When I switched brokerages  the new advisor mentioned that the former one did not have a fiduciary responsibility towards me.

For context I have about $15000 between ETFs and a HYSA. 
~10,000 in HYSA
~2,000 in QQQ
~1500 in SCHD

Looking at my gains / losses I‚Äôm only up 2%.

Couple of questions I have are:

1. How is this calculated? I just recently (last few weeks) I bought all the SCHD I have, and 2 more shares of QQQ. How are the gains / losses calculated even though I‚Äôve already had some QQQ? Does it take into account say I bought QQQ at $400 a year ago (hypothetical) and it went up 10% to today. I bought more today ($440) and it went down 5% in a year ($418). My total gain / loss would be +5%? Is that right? 

2. Is my percentage of gain / loss because a small % of my portfolio is actually invested? I only have about $3700 invested and 10,000 in a HYSA. So portfolio wise I‚Äôm not up a bunch but individual ETFs I‚Äôm up around 20%? (QQQ is around +14% & SCHD is +6%)

3. Last question is, the gains loss tab for the lifetime of my portfolio? From day 1 of investing into QQQ until today? ",2024-02-19,0

Prior to this event, I diligently followed numerous Twitter accounts in the Crypto space and was thoroughly following reputable Crypto YouTubers, intending to invest in crypto before the whole FTX incident unfolded. Little did I know that I was witnessing a significant dip and should have seized the opportunity to buy at that time.

Regrettably, I waited, hoping for an even greater drop so I could purchase during the ""real"" dip. Unfortunately, my hesitation was fueled by greed, leading to a missed opportunity. Reflecting on it now, I find it difficult to forgive myself for not capitalizing on the Crypto market during that downturn. I could have at least bought some and sold them today, at a profit.

Dealing with the daily realization that, as a first-time investor, I missed a massive chance is undeniably disheartening.

Moving forward, I'd like to ask what are some investments that could yield returns in the short-to-medium run. While I understand the stock market is often seen as a long-term investment, I'm not looking to invest with a huge amount at this time.

What I am looking for is advice on any other ways to grow retirement non taxable accounts?? I have learned a lot from reddit and while I am seeking Financial advisors, I want to be informed independently too. 

For several reasons I am quite behind on my 401k value as it should be per my age (been contributing since 2010.)

Mistakes I think I made:

1. Started contributing late. Missed out on 3 years of contribution into 401k

2. Didnt max out 401k contribution until 2-3 yrs ago. Was contributing around 6% or so. Match was 1.5% for many years. 

3. Stopped contributing to Roth as I was above income limits starting 2017. Didnt take advantage of backdoor etc

4. Didnt reinvest dividends in non taxable accounts. (All reinvested now.)

5. Didnt take advantage of HSA.

6. Lost NW from Divorce. (No pre nup)

7. Didnt take advantage of additional contribution from my company for certain employees. ( a company benefit I missed out on).

What I am doing now:

1. Fully maxed out on 401k

2. Working through backdoor/megabackdoor to start the roth contributions each year.

3. Currently investing in Tbills (moved away from CDs) for tax reasons. (Laddered Tbills 6 months and a year). Doubt i‚Äùll have this option in the future.

4. In 8 yrs when I am 50 and if the law still allows then I‚Äùll take advantage of  the catch up contribution but its not much. 

No HSA available to me. 

My Question - What else can I do to grow my non taxable account value? 

Is all my NW going to come from taxable accounts? With high CA taxes, lawyer fees each year (hoping it will be resolved next by end of year) and forced to put house purchase on hold I dont know what else to do other than start really cutting on expenses to Grow my savings.

NW: ~ 1M; break down is as follows:

1. 290k in brokerage account

2. 200k Tbills

3. 100k HYSA which is my EF

4. 200k 401k, TiRA and Roth

5. 210k in RSUs vested

HHI: 600k depending on stock price.

(Car loan is already deducted from the liquid assets I have. No CC debt as its paid off every month. I Invest 1000 per month in stocks since last 2 yrs - had a gap of 3-4 months due to large expenses. Saving 5-10% each paycheck into HYsA.) 

Everything currently points to just building and growing my taxable assets - brokerage, HYSA and perhaps in the future rental / primary property.

But read forward to understand how crazy 401K to IRA Rollovers can be.**

My wife had almost $300,000 in her Empower 401K.  When she lost her job she decided to roll over the funds in her 401K into an individual IRA.  (She could have kept the money in her 401K but had lots of fees and limited investment options.)

She looked into moving the money over to Fidelity where she had an investment account, but got nervous when they told her they (Empower) would mail her a check which she would then have to present to Fidelity. The Internet is full of horror stories of 401K Rollover checks being lost or stolen from the mail.  This happened to two different friends of ours and it took them nearly a month to get it all settled and the money was out of the stock market during a month the market was booming.

So my wife decided to keep the money with Empower and open an Empower IRA so she would simply do a direct 401K to IRA Rollover within the same company.  It was suppose to be easy with no paper check.

So two weeks ago the money was taken out of her 401K account and it now shows zero.  Every day she checks the Empower IRA Account and that shows a ZERO Balance.  The money is lost in computer bureaucracy and not getting any investment returns. The Empower Website says this should only take 2-3 business days!

Every three days she calls the Customer Service Number of Empower and after sitting on hold for 30-60 minutes an unhelpful person answers the phone and tells my wife the transfer (401K to Rollover IRA) **is in process.**  Yesterday, in total frustration, she talked to a supervisor and was told the same thing- the rollover is in process.

This could happen to any of us with any Investing/Brokerage Company doing a direct no check 401K to IRA Rollover.

I noticed the main challenges are:  


* **Finding out if the startup/business is real (due diligence)**: Like I don't know if their revenue is accurate or how many active users/customers they have
* **Tracking their investments**: If you've invested $25k in each startup, how can you track them? Bth the financial amount and the startup's progress
* **Exiting sooner than a liquidity event**: Is it possible to transfer your shares you got as an angel investor sooner than a liquidity event (e.g. another funding round) by the startup? Like sell your shares to another investor or exchange them for another startup lol
* **People just assume you're rich by default**: Noticed in some events when someone says I'm an angel investor, founders rush into them asking for >$100k. Is that normal?

I'm curious about the investment strategy of buying high when it's a good company.  For examples, look at Microsoft, Amazon, Eli Lilly, and Nvidia.

All at very high points.  Hitting new all time highs even.  In theory, my heart says if you truly believe in the company and that the stock will go up, then buying high isn't a problem.  But my brain is just like, NO, it'll clearly go down.  You never buy high lol.

So what do YOU all do?  Do you have a favorite stock that you buy more of no matter how high it gets? Or do you just enjoy the ride with what you have and look for something else to invest in?

I do have some small positions in those four companies, which is why I'm familiar with them. Clearly I'm comfortable enough with them to hold the shares I have. But my brain is just so wired to not buy high at peaks.  I've read a decent amount of different strategies and things to look for, but I've never really seen anything about a successful company and buying high.

I know it could be a little subjective too. Depends on your age and risk tolerance and things like that and what you are looking for, but I guess I'm just trying to go for a more General approach in this question. But in an effort to help if people want, I'm mid 30s, married, kids on the way. Have a good job and not worry about retirement. My personal investing is to try to Simply make money for me and the family for stuff like trips and fixing the house and things like that, so risk tolerance is fairly high.

I guess you could boil this down to a simple question.

On the flip side, it does make sense that if one or more of these startups take off, they'll be creating organic demand for Nvidia products.

Here's a distilled essence of their current trajectory:  
1. Regulatory Dichotomy: The U.S. presents a regulatory mosaic, with state and federal laws creating a complex tapestry of driving regulations. Conversely, China operates under a unified federal system, spearheaded by Xi Jinping, an unchallenged architect of policy.  
2. Autonomous Ambitions: This contrast in governance models suggests a divergent path toward the adoption of autonomous vehicles. The U.S., with its regulatory labyrinth, might find itself trailing, whereas China's streamlined approach positions it at the forefront, potentially accelerating Chinese dominance in the autonomous vehicle sector through invaluable real-world data accumulation.  
3. Economic Transitions: Yet, the broader economic canvas reveals China amidst a seismic shift from a manufacturing behemoth to a service-oriented giant. This transition, fraught with volatility, casts a shadow over the Chinese stock market, hinting at protracted growing pains that could extend into the Year of the Horse (2027), as growth rates recalibrate from explosive to sustainable.

There are some warning signs that the economy is slowing down, such as:

- The real-time Sahm Rule Recession Indicator, which measures the change in the unemployment rate, is at 0.2%, which is close to the threshold of 0.5% that signals the start of a recession
- The Conference Board Leading Economic Index, which tracks 10 indicators of future economic activity, declined by 0.1% in December 2023, the first drop since April 2020.
- The OECD Composite Leading Indicator, which covers 37 countries and regions, fell by 0.1 point to 99.6 in November 2023, the lowest level since June 2020.

Stayed at the Horseshoe (CZR strip property). I have a traditional ""lads' trip to Vegas Super Bowl weekend every year (this was my 6th trip) - extended a bit more this year with the Super Bowl in town.

CZRs ""mid-market' properties

Noticed that the high-end properties (Cosmo, Aria) were hopping and jammed. (note: not CZRs properties). 6-8 craps tables operating Thursday and Friday night, with $50-$100 minimums. By contrast, the CZR properties across the street (Planet Hollywood (PH), Paris, Horseshoe, Linq, Flamingo) were much quieter. For instance, PH only had 3 $15 craps tables on Thursday night.

Tables seemed no busier than previous years at the mid-market CZRs properties. Hypothesis is that the ""gambling / partying"" crowd was priced out this year with the Super Bowl in town.

CZRs Execution Risk

PH's marquee 'Heart Bar' was being renovated and converted to a chandelier / glass bar. The new bar was not ready Wednesday-Thursday-Friday during the day of Super Bowl week. (It eventually opened Friday at midnight). Not a good look to have a marquee drinking/party hangout not ready to go for one of the busiest times of the year.

Craps dealers at Paris (Friday night) and Horseshoe (Sunday night) were a long way from being centre-strip Vegas quality. Odds are ""meh"" and limits are high - there is really no reason to make a gambling trip to Vegas - your local casino likely has better dealers, lower limits, and better odds.

CZRs restaurants

Restaurants (Nobu at Paris, Bugsy/Meyers at Flamingo) were busy and an excellent value. So were the cocktails at Vanderpump (Paris).

Conclusion

Overall, the crew this year was a bit frustrated with the CZRs experience and may look elsewhere for our next strip.

It has a $1 minimum investment which is super convenient for using for ""loose ends"" in a brokerage account. It yields a heck of a lot more than most cash sweeps, and is only slightly less flexible because I can get the money out of it by the end of the day and then trade with it a couple days later at the latest. Unlike savings accounts there is no transaction limit per month so it's perfect for temporary money storage, and rebalancing purposes in a portfolio.

I notice that there are also funds that are similar, but have minimum balances of $1M, which, understandably, yield a bit more (often as much as 0.25% more), probably because of lower expense ratios because they have fewer little transactions. I have nowhere near this level of cash.

However, I would love to find something intermediate between it and these higher-yield, higher-minimum-balance ones. I don't particularly need the full flexibility of the $1 minimum balance nor do I really need to be able to trade in $1 increments.

Parents have a portfolio worth around 4.5M. Dad is early 70s earning \~250K/year and will work another 1-8 years (he would like to work as long as he can, but taking into account uncertainty). Mom late 60s, doesn‚Äôt work. Total expenses around 100-120K/year, no one is sick yet. Risk averse people.They pay advisor .75% fee, with 20% in money market, 75% bonds, 5% VTSAX bringing their total expense ratio to around 1%. Comes to around 40K/year in fees (they hold some money in their own checking account). However, when my mom asked him how much they were paying, he brushed it off and said something vague about a monthly cost without giving specifics. He also allowed them to sell in 2020, never get back into the market, and their total net worth has been the same for 4 years (so losing because of inflation). Parents not financially literate at all. I figured if they have almost all their money in cash/fixed income, but still insist on having an advisor, Facet (all fiduciaries) can do that for a quoted 5-6K/year, plus expense ratio around .1%. 6-8K/year tops, and they can keep everything in fixed income.  That would save them about $30K/year in cost. Facet claims to have a HYSA at 5.3% right now, and they can keep a primarily-fixed income plan but save a ton of money.Thoughts on this plan/Facet?

Why I don't trust him as their advisor:

\- When asked how much they pay a year, he said they are ""billed monthly"" and didn't give an actual number

\- Did not make clear to parents that they had to expense ratios into account - they genuinely thought they were just paying .75%.

\- He's an MBA and Registered Agent, but NOT a CFP

\- He constantly talks about his family and comes across as a greaseball who is blatantly trying to develop the ""emotional connection"" these guys are undoubtedly encouraged to do.

\- He told me he'd set me up with a portfolio that would put me ""in the millions"" in regard to my Roth IRA (while technically eventually true... just sleezy).

So in that case, if I invested in a vanguard fund, then I should also be the partial owner in the company in relation to my percentage ownership of the fund? Eg, if the fund owns 100 shares of apple, and I own 1 percent of the fund, then I own 1 share of apple. Of course in reality the ownership stake would be negligible. 

Is this actually true? And do we not get voting rights in each underlying company due to just how many there are and how insane it would be to tally every single investors vote for every single company, in say the SP500. Or is it because we only own a partial stake in vanguard and it means nothing for the underlying companies they invest in? If someone had a larger, majority stake in a vanguard fund, would they have voting rights, or am I missing something?

Next question is about BlackRock. It's a public company. So if I invest in a BlackRock fund, who is the owner partially, of the underlying companies? Is it me indirectly through my stake in the fund, while the shareholders in BlackRock profit from the money BlackRock earns through charging me fees.

I‚Äôve been doing this with him for 7 years or so. Everything has gone well. My question is he gives me 10% per annual interest for borrowing the money. So if I loan him $300,000 you multiply that by .10 and divide that by 12 (months) therefor he gives me $2,500.00 a month. He usually gives the capital back anywhere from 3-6 months. All of his work is insured and contracts are done to protect me and all that good stuff.

My question is does anybody else do this? Is 10% a good rate for me or could I get more? I had a different guy that wanted to do something similar and he heard I got 10% and so he said he would give me 11% just to get me to switch. The big difference is he wants me to sign a 5 year contract with my money. He also mentioned how it usually works is the longer the loan the lower the interest rate.

* \~‚Ç¨160 meal vouchers
* Company car & fuel card
* Pension savings ('Group insurance') to which \~‚Ç¨130 is added each month
* The 'usual' (insurance, holiday pay, 13th month, ...)

* ETFs: Invested ‚Ç¨33.000, now it is worth ‚Ç¨44.000+
* Cryptocurrencies: Invested ‚Ç¨5000, now it is worth ‚Ç¨45.000
* Cash: ‚Ç¨10.000
* Retirement funds: ‚Ç¨4.000+
* Personal Companies: \~‚Ç¨35.000
   * Used ‚Ç¨30.000 to start a small **real estate company** with 2 friends. We've done 2 projects since (flipping 2 apartments) but I'm still waiting on the final year overview from the accountant to update the ‚Ç¨30.000 to the actual value right now.
   * The other ‚Ç¨5.000 was invested in a business I recently took over together with my girlfriend. This business is a **fry shop** (called 'frituur' in Dutch) which is now running for a little over a month. Of course, we took a loan from the bank as well. It is still too early to update the value of this company.
* Real Estate: \~‚Ç¨30.000 in equity. This is the building that we bought together with the 'frituur' business mentioned above. We are in the process of renovating the apartment on the first floor so we can actually live there as well in a couple of months.

2053,How I analyze stocks for the long-term: Framework walkthrough,3,1arbdre,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1arbdre/how_i_analyze_stocks_for_the_longterm_framework/,8,"I wrote a post a few days back on why we should *learn* to analyze individual stocks, even if you choose to invest most of your money in index funds/ETFs. You can read the post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1amihwf/why_you_should_learn_to_invest_in_individual/).

In this post, I will share the process I have been using to analyze individual stocks. It requires fair bit of work and thinking, but it‚Äôs worth the effort for the clarity I get.

When we buy a stock, we are buying piece of a business. By asking a series of structured questions, I try to understand how the underlying business works, predict what it will be like in a few years, and estimate a reasonable price for buying it whole.

I don‚Äôt want to spent weeks and months doing complex analysis and financial modeling like institutional investors. My goal is to do simple evaluation of publicly traded companies by putting in reasonable effort to arrive at a conclusion that makes sense for me as an the individual investor.

Even though I only intend to buy few stocks, I think that I will be buying the whole business and keep it for many years. And to figure out if I want to purchase it, I try to answer these six questions:

1. **What does the business do?**
2. **Is it a good business?**
3. **If it‚Äôs a good business, why is it good?**
4. **Can it remain a good business in future too?**
5. **Is it run by competent and honest people?**
6. **Is it available at a fair price?**

Let‚Äôs take a hypothetical example to illustrate how this investing framework can be applied. Imagine that a popular sandwich store in our neighborhood just became available for sale. We have money in bank and are seriously considering buying it. I will try to answer these questions in order (We will skip management analysis in this example as it‚Äôs more applicable for public companies)

**1. What does this business do?** We want to figure out how does this business work and make money. There are four main things to understand:

* What does the business sell? *(sandwiches, drinks, cookies)*
* Who are the customers? *(locals vs tourists, old vs young, rich vs poor)*
* How does it sell its products and services? *(what are the channels: in-store vs online orders vs group catering)*
* What are its costs? *(ingredients, labor, rent, marketing)*

**2. Is it a good business?** Once we have a decent understanding of how the business works, we want to look at its health. More specifically,

* Does it have a clean balance sheet? *(is it loaded up with debt? And how much assets the store owns?)*
* What are the sales of the store? *(revenue from sale of food and drinks)*
* What are the profit margins like? *(gross profit and net profit)*
* How much cash does the store generates? *(operating cash and free cash flow)*
* What‚Äôs the return on invested capital? *(Am I better off just buying risk-free bonds?)*
* How have these numbers grown or declined in last few years? How does these numbers compare to industry average and other similar food joints?

**3. What makes it a good business?** So far if we think it‚Äôs a good business, we now want to understand why is it so and how it stands out from competition.

* Who are its competitors? *(local joints, larger chains, other eateries)*
* Does it have a competitive advantage or a ‚Äúmoat‚Äù *(hard to have moats in food industry for local stores, but few have a strong brand)*
* Why do customers keep coming back to this place? Or will they keep paying even when we raise prices?

**4. Will it continue to be a good business in future?** This is where we need to think strategically about future, especially about three aspects:

* Is the company‚Äôs moat durable? *(If the owner or chef leaves, will the business tank? What can harm the brand?)*
* What are the main risks the business face? *(What if key suppliers go out of business or increase prices? Can changing customer preferences towards healthier foods impact sales?)*
* What are the biggest opportunities? *(is there potential for expanding store locations, increasing menu items, hiking prices, or cutting costs)*

**5. Is the business available at a fair price?** Now we bring it all together and assess if the current offer price is reasonable or too high. This needs a bit of number crunching, but we will avoid complex projections on heavy excel sheets.

* What drives earning growth? *(economy in general, influx of residents, inflation?)*
* How would the earnings grow in next few years? *(Future is uncertain and probabilistic so we need to think of worst, likely, and best case scenarios)*
* What would be the value of this business after a few years? *(what kind of multiple it is available today on earnings or sales? what will be a reasonable multiple in future?)*
* Will I loose a lot of money if things go wrong? *(Is there some margin of safety in price I am paying)*
* Given all this, what‚Äôs a price that I am happy to pay today? *(One that will meet my return expectations at risk I am comfortable with)*
* If the asking price is higher or lower than my happy price, why is that the case? *(Do I understand why owner is asking for lower price or why market is valuing it lower? What am I missing?)*

After I have good enough answers to these questions, I will put pen to paper and summarize my thinking in a crisp 1-pager. This will becomes my investing thesis and guide me to make a buy or pass decision. This is exactly the same process we can follow for analyzing any publicly listed company.

For every dozen or so 1-pagers I have write, I will *maybe* invest in one. Sometimes I won‚Äôt understand the business well enough and other times I won‚Äôt like the price. But that's okay! I know that I have done the hard part already. I will keep the stock in my watchlist, move on to the next stock, and update the analysis from time to time if I liked the business.

As you can imagine, this is simple but not easy. It‚Äôs not for everyone. But it is very satisfying and intellectually stimulating. And like every other skill, it gets easier with practice.

That's it! That's the process I use. I would love to hear you feedback on how I can improve on this. Also, if this is interesting, I can write few posts on diving deeper into each of these sub-parts with an example of a public stock.",2024-02-15,0

> Wall Street fund managers are now extremely bullish, the closely watched BofA Fund Manager survey revealed. Fund managers have slashed their holdings in cash and Treasury bills to low levels: At an average of 4.2% of assets, cash levels are now down about a third since October, **and are a whisper from the 4% level that BofA, historically, considers an automatic sell warning**[my Reddit emphasis added]. Meanwhile, fund managers are now more heavily invested in U.S. stocks than at any time since November 2021

That is the paragraph that got my attention. First, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever seen that stat before. % cash if surveyed fund mgrs 

I can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs alarming. (And I took out a few adjectives and adverbs that made the article more sensational.) it depends on how smart you think fund mgrs are.

The author says than when the fund managers are soft on an industry, there are often good buys, because they are value priced based on the fund managers avoiding them. Of course, they *could* be avoiding sectors for good reasons. 

It‚Äôs questionable whether the fund managers are knowledgeable or not. But what is without question is wherever they go, they‚Äôre going to raise asset prices. Because they‚Äôre in command of so much money. It‚Äôs like the ETF principle. Or being added to the S&P 500.

So this is also what the report showed:

> Right now, fund managers are heavily invested in U.S. stocks and in bonds. Their most popular sectors are technology, communication services, and pharmaceuticals. Outside of the U.S., they are also big on Japanese equities

> Their least favorite sectors are energy, materials, banks and utilities. Their least favorite regions are Europe (especially London, but actually the whole continent) and emerging markets.

Where there are avoiding seems pretty reasonable and rational. Banks are completely in the air, while the fed tries to make up its mind. 

I‚Äôm surprised they are in Bonds at this time, but it doesn‚Äôt really say how much or what kind. Pharma is also surprising. I‚Äôve been looking at AstraZeneca for a long ass time now and every time I take a half step toward buying some, it tanks. Which reminds me that I don‚Äôt understand the industry very well.

So a lot of money that was on the sidelines, as of last October, is in the market and it‚Äôs focused on tech, communications, pharma. And you can see the first two definitely being pushed, as if it needed any help. But I don‚Äôt see a whole lot of movement in Pharma unless I‚Äôm looking in the wrong places.

But what do you think it says about fund managers being optimistic and invested with both feet?",2024-02-14,0

I'm reaching out to this community because of a unique opportunity that has caught my attention. A local government here in Estonia is looking for partners to develop a SPA center/hotel, and this announcement really speaks to me both professionally and personally.  
  
**A Bit About Me:**  
My current business involves supplying promotional goods and items like hotel slippers to various clients, including those in the hospitality industry. This has given me a unique insight into this sector, albeit from a different angle. On top of that, I am a huge SPA fan myself. I've always been drawn to the relaxation, wellness, and the sheer joy that SPA experiences offer.  
  
**The Opportunity:**  
When I learned about the local government's initiative, it immediately sparked my interest. The idea of being part of creating a new SPA center/hotel ‚Äî a place where people can find peace, wellness, and relaxation ‚Äî is incredibly appealing. I see it as a chance to blend my professional background with my personal passion for SPAs.

* **What I'm Hoping to Find Out:**  **Interest and Viability**: Does the idea of developing a SPA center/hotel resonate with you? Do you think there's a market for another one, considering the unique angle we could bring? Advice on Getting Started: For those who have experience in launching or running a SPA or hotel, what were your initial steps? I'm looking for guidance on how to begin this journey.

Because of religion purposes I currently own an iShares World ETF which is ‚Äòreligion proof‚Äô. I want to diversify my portfolio a bit, without all the stocks that are not allowed to invest for religion purposes, which are in the famous etf‚Äôs like S&P 500 and the other ‚Äònormal‚Äô World ETF‚Äôs. Stocks like finance, alcohol and tobacco for example. 

I was thinking about the Nasdaq 100 ETF or the SPDR World Technology ETF. Because most tech stocks are allowed, but it‚Äôs also a bit risky because it‚Äôs only one sector. Maybe also ETF‚Äôs which focusses on Health Care?

What would you guys advise me to diversify my ETF portfolio, without buying stocks individually and without buying an ETF with stocks that are forbidden like finances?

Thanks!!",2024-02-14,0

I handle the financials for a guy and his multiple companies. The owner of the company I work for has an investment broker, he's been around for a handful of few years. Almost every month (more in recent months than previously) the broker tells him he can get him a 30% return, the minimum he can buy in for every month is a million - which he takes in towards the end of every month. The owner has invested many millions and gets an interest check at the beginning of every month. I talk with both the owner and the broker fairly regularly. I was told that an extra million invested increases the monthly interest by about $23k - so annually that's about 28%. The broker has made comments such as, ""I have up to $10M available for this investment this month"". I don't know what it's actually invested in - although he does get a statement, I just haven't looked close enough at what it's invested in (although if it truly is a ponzi scheme, the statement very well could be fake). The owner has mentioned this to many other professionals he works with and many of them have reached out to me about how it's very fishy. I met the investment broker once, as did one of these other professionals, and we both had the same reaction - the broker is very arrogant, super questionable, and just comes off as a complete scum bag.

The broker is listed on the website for a major investment bank. He's listed on Advisor Check and Broker Check and has what looks like a clean record - over a dozen years experience with multiple firms, multiple exams passed, licensed in 30+ states. 

Am I thinking wrong here? I just can't believe the return, it's completely unrealistic. It's also odd that the minimum is $1m and the guy is trying to sell more investments at the end of every month, then paying out interest at the beginning of every month - seems a bit like robbing Peter to pay Paul. I've thought about making an anonymous tip to the SEC, but I feel like I'm risking a lot by doing so. I don't even know how to approach this. In my mind there's no chance this is legit, but at the same time, the interest checks have been coming in without issue.

I believe there is tremendous upside left in the stock.  


**These are my reasons to buy:**  


**Pick and Shovel Play** : Pagaya is a Fintech, pick and shovels, AI play providing a platform/software service to commercial lenders like Visa, banks, and even Fintech competitor SoFi Technologies (SOFI). It has an excellent de-risking AI business model at scale for lenders and investors.  


**Low Credit Risk:** Pagaya doesn‚Äôt keep any loans on its books, except a small percentage of securitizations made by them for mandatory risk retention compliance.  


**Recurring Fee Based Business**: It charges fees to business clients (lenders) like Visa (V), Ally Financial (ALLY) and SoFi Technologies to provide due diligence and credit analysis of their potential borrowers - sift through their initially-declined loan applications, and find any good loans among the declined ones.  


**Network Model**: Pagaya bundles these loans and moves them to their final destination - investors. 80% of the loans get bundled into ABS, (Asset Backed Securities), which institutional clients have agreed to purchase in advance. The other 20% of the bundled loans are sold to private investors, and Pagaya charges them a fee for that service  


**Switching Costs:** It takes Pagaya and the lender about 2-3 years to complete onboarding and integration. Clients are likely to remain loyal.  
**It has strong capital and institutional Backing:** The Singapore Government Fund, which owns 9% of Pagaya is also a large buyer of ABS.  
**Strong pipeline:** Pagaya has a large and very credible pipeline, a unique business model, which de-risks the lending business in real time and a platform that works across several products and lenders.  


**Challenges, weaknesses and threats**  


**Cyclical:** This is a Cutthroat, Commodity, Cyclical business and sure there is the AI product differentiator, but over time, even M/L or AI platforms or software will become a commoditized business, without significant competitive advantages.  
Network volume flatlined in Q1-2022, at 1.6Bn, then stagnated at $1.9Bn in two quarters of 2022, with even one decrease to $1.8Bn. We finally saw growth renewing in Q1-2023 to $1.9Bn.  


**Barriers to entry are low: F**or example, their lender customers could easily develop the same software. Their lenders who are much bigger, SoFi Technologies itself is $7.5Bn in market cap, a little less than 10 times Pagaya's size, -- could become their biggest competitors by investing in similar AI software for themselves, eliminate Pagaya and shop their own product around like AWS.  


**Dilution:** Another challenge is the possibility of continued dilution. Share count stood at 738Mn shares in Sep 2023 compared to 667Mn in Sep 2022, an increase of 11%...  


**Valuation**  


Pagaya is priced at only 1.05 times sales and with an estimated Sales CAGR of 22%, this drops to 0.6x sales - it had current assets of $419Mn in Sep 2023- that‚Äôs about half its market cap of $855Mn ! That's a steal! Compare that to SoFi, which is priced at 3.7X sales and has a 3 year forward CAGR of 19% lower than Pagaya. Plus, SoFi earns only a part of its revenues from services, they earn interest income as well, which carries credit risk.  
They will soon be listed in the US - that itself could be a huge boost.  
And can also benefit from a reverse stock split, which removes the cheaper branding of a $1 stock.

* I don‚Äôt know anyone who thinks a portfolio of stocks and bonds has a higher unconditional expected return than 100% stocks. We prefer a diversified portfolio because we believe it has a higher return for the risk taken, not a higher expected return.

* In general we should separate the choice of 1) what is the best return-for-risk portfolio?, and 2) what risk we should take? This new paper, and many like it, confuse the two. If the best return-for-risk portfolio doesn‚Äôt have enough expected return for you, then you lever it (within reason). If it has too much risk for you, you de-lever it with cash.

* Rising valuations (since the 1990s) have made equities themselves (and especially the USA vs. ex-USA differential) a very likely overestimation of the future.

* Simply looking at historical results and urging investors to ‚Äúbuy the thing that‚Äôs gone up the most over the long term‚Äù is not financial analysis, it is finger painting.

I say that by looking at the data. For example. Amazon trades at 100x earnings and grows 15 percent a year. That is a terrible stock for anyone trying to actually get a return from the asset itself, but trading it is potentially profitable like it is for every single stock. Also I have another example. Nvidia trades at like 35 x sales. The margins are high but obviously companies like Meta will inevitably have to roll out their own independent GPU solutions to control costs, and therefore the stock itself looks ungodly expensive. The same is looking at arm. Arm which trades at like 150 x earnings, or something crazy, literally grows at like 28 percent. That means it will takes like 26 years to even get a 10 percent return for the equity.

Then, if you look at what stocks were trading at in like 2004, Apple, it was like 33 x earnings with higher revenue growth, a tiny market cap, better leadership. This compared to the 2000's investing environment or earlier is terrible, yet it seems people think that they can make investments whenever they want.  


It goes on and on. Looking at Palantir which trades at a crazy multiple, or basically any software company, yes it's possible to buy Palantir or any stock and it triple, but trying to get earnings at a good multiple in other words, Real INVESTING seems to be literally impossible right now.  


Even the chinese stock market has collapsed mainly due to companies like Alibaba growing at only 5 percent their topline.   


And there are questions like how is this possible and is this partly due to extremely irresponsible Fed reserve activity mainly due to QE pushing valuations to their highest levels ever. Also do the people here think that this is the worst investing environment ever when compared to historical pe ratios?",2024-02-13,0

I've been exploring potential investment opportunities with Rollman Capital and Rollman Mining. Both organizations caught my interest with their focus on investment management and Bitcoin mining services, respectively. Rollman Capital promotes a conviction-driven investment approach, aiming to blend performance with a positive societal impact. Meanwhile, Rollman Mining is all about providing access to Bitcoin mining through procurement of miners, software, pools, and hosting services, emphasizing professional-level equipment for both private and professional clients.  
  
My curiosity led me to a video call with the CEO of Rollman Mining, where we discussed various aspects of their services, including costs, potential ROI, and the specifics of their Bitcoin mining operations. While the conversation was enlightening, offering deep insights into their business model and promises of transparency and high returns, I'm left wanting to cross-reference these claims with independent experiences.  
  
Given the scarcity of independent reviews and a lack of publicly available financial data or significant third-party media coverage, I'm reaching out to this knowledgeable community for any personal experiences or insights you might have about Rollman Capital or Rollman Mining. I'm particularly interested in:

**-Your method of due diligence when assessing firms with limited third-party validation.**

I would like to invest in certain funds/ETFs that pay dividends, most of them to be qualified dividends. Before doing that, I would like to see the history of the distributions from that fund.

In Vanguard, for example, I can see the year-end QDI figures (payments in December) but not the payments made in other quarters.

One example of this is payments on 09/28/2023, 06/29/2023, and 03/24/2023 from VFIAX 500 Index Fund Admiral Shares. I cannot see any option to see the qualified dividend ratio for these dividend payments.

Our first thoughts were to keep our future down payment savings in one or two HYSAs earning about 4.5% APY since they're at a 15-year high. However, I know once the fed funds rate starts coming down, probably in the second half of this year, so will the rates for HYSAs. Another option we've considered is putting our down payment savings into CDs which will lock in a better rate (\~5.4%) for a year even if the fed funds rate goes down. 

I've also considered putting some of our savings into a brokerage account and using it to invest in the S&P 500 (likely FXAIX) and letting it grow over the next 2+ years. This could have greater returns. But of course we then run the risk of losing some of that money if the market drops.

At this time their yields seem to be extremely similar with BND sitting at 4.36% SEC Yield and BSV having 4.46% SEC Yield. 

The only risk I can think of is if the FED starts dropping interest rates, causing BND's longer-term bonds locked in at a higher yield being able to hold on the better yields for longer, whereas BSV is going to be more dependent on recent prices?

That being said, I'm actually not sure how BND and BSV (bond ETFs) are managed when it comes to the market selling off bonds and re-allocating to different bonds.

There is a push by Biden admin to develop local capacity, as China currently dominates the biz. A crash in lithium prices has put many projects on hold. Also, regions are demanding more protection of their natural resources. Brine water is a big source of lithium and evaporation pools had always been common, which can leave layers of toxic chemicals in its wake. New methods, like this article about Utah‚Äôs Great Salt Lake, pump water out and filter it, leaving the lake largely in tact.

From Wall Street journal:

https://www.wsj.com/science/environment/great-salt-lake-lithium-startup-lilac-d84c9f76?mod=djem10point

> This summer, a California startup plans to start construction on a project to suck up water from the Great Salt Lake to extract one of its many valuable minerals: lithium

> The effort is one of dozens of projects across the U.S. racing to build up a domestic supply of lithium and other battery minerals, with adoption of electric vehicles expected to boom as part of the country‚Äôs transition to cleaner energy. The Biden administration is dedicating billions of dollars to strengthening the U.S. battery supply chain and reducing reliance on China, which dominates the global production of battery minerals.

> The challenge: finding ways to efficiently extract the mineral from rocks and water while minimizing environmental damage.

> ‚ÄúLithium resources in the U.S. are very large in scale, but the chemistry is very challenging,‚Äù said Lilac founder and Chief Executive Dave Snydacker. 

> Briny water is among the most promising resources for lithium in the U.S. Exxon Mobil is drilling for lithium-laden brines deep underground in Arkansas‚Äôs Smackover region. Other companies are working to extract lithium from brines in California‚Äôs Salton Sea. 

It‚Äôs funny that oil companies are getting in on it. One of the major pitfalls of drilling for oil is you often hit saltwater first. And it was hard to dispose of it because it destroys agriculture and there was a lot of it. Like they‚Äôre leasing these drilling spots often from ranchers or agricultural areas. if they had a gusher of saltwater without properly containing it, that land would be unable to support much in the way of vegetation because it was contaminated with salt. So what had always been an annoying aspect of oil and gas drilling is trying to be leveraged into a lithium mine. And oil companies got a century or so experience of dealing with it.

> crash in prices for lithium and other battery minerals in 2023 prompted mining companies to slow expansions of projects and put new ones on hold. The delays threaten to slow the country‚Äôs push to develop its battery supply chain, even as lithium demand surges.",2024-02-12,0

VPU in Last 5 years has returned 4.85%. 
  
Yes, electricity demand has been mostly stagnant in the past couple of decades (1-2% increase annually). However, considering that it is so timely and costly to construct power plants (for example, 5-8 years long from permitting to construction in CA), labor intensive, running power plants and distributing & transmitting electricity and guaranteed profit margins through rate increases - one would have thought it would have some premium.  
  
Secondly, what about from now into the future? 
AI is going to introduce a step-change function in electricity demand, raising multiple challenges around maintaining the electric grid while at the same time transitioning to cleaner energy. For example, compared to residential power consumption by city, Nvidia's H100 chips would rank as the 5th largest just behind Houston, Texas. [1]  
It is forecasted that by 2027 A.I. servers could use between 85 to 134 terawatt hours (Twh) annually. That's similar to what Argentina consumes annually. [2].

Cool. She's now open to finding another advisor and trying something new out.

&#x200B;

So now where do we go? I checked into Fidelity as they have branches around here, and their products from a DIY perspective which I have been doing are amazing - for people like her who don't understand what stocks are, they have target date funds and robo advisor programs - but she does want someone she can talk to in person and that's a big thing for her. They seem to have a minimum cash requirement which we are not at for their Wealth Management (500k) - and they may offer other services from what I have heard if you have 50k or more, but the reviews for local offices here are horrible - 1.5 to 2/5 stars on Google. So maybe Fidelity may be just as bad if not worse than Edward Jones from a ""advisor"" stance.

&#x200B;

Definitely do want someone who is a fiduciary. But the question is at that point how that works - because if they are independent kind of like CPAs/etc... then how would some random Fiduciary manage the ""keys"" to my wife's 401K plans and IRAs? Would I have to link accounts up and/or give them access to trade on her behalf, or would they basically tell her / us what we should do in terms of investing the money? I'm confused how this would work if the assets are not at the same place as the advisor.

&#x200B;

My biggest fear and I don't want to say this in the wrong way - but since we are DINKs and we won't have kids, that when we get old, our mental health may start to go out like POTUS style. If that happens, we may have a lot of money I would have forgotten how to manage at that age and/or fall victim to scams like many older people do. It's great being young and eager to save fees and DIY right now, but I mean I'm 38. 30 years from now I could have onsets of dementia.

One of the big cons with renting vs housing is rent prices will always go up while a 30 year fixed stays the same.

But if SP500 goes up faster than rent, and someone does not want to buy a house, wouldn't it just be good to hold SP500 and withdraw yearly to pay for a years worth of rent?

Ex. 24 years old and life expectancy is 75 = \~50 years left, which is about 600 month. 600 months of rent at 2000/mo = $1,200,000 in a lifetime.

If I had 1.2 million in SP500 RIGHT NOW (hypothetically) (and along with other assets), wouldn't it just be alright to rent forever and withdraw from the 1.2 million gradually over time to pay for the rent?

As we know, short positions require more conviction and are more likely to be a made by a sophisticated investor, as they are borrowing money to keep the position open. Research has also shown that investors engaging in short selling typically focus on valuations and fundamentals more than the average investor.

For example: not opening a position on stocks with more than 5% short interest.

The scenario is, an unemployed person with no other income, had invested in cryptocurrency awhile back and their investment is now at a profit of $150,000. Let‚Äôs say their cost basis was $1 for the sake of simple calculations.

Can they, by the end of 2024, sell $47,000 worth of the crypto, all under the 0% tax rate so they‚Äôll pay $0 in taxes.

When 2025 starts, they rebuy $47,000 of the same crypto, and by the end of 2025, sell a other $94,000 worth of crypto. The net profit would be $47,000, again all under 0% tax rate.

Repeat until all investments have a net profit of $0 while still keeping the same holdings.

Is this illegal?

Edit to clarify: The goal is not to cash in profit tax free, but to turn $150,000 in profit into a holding with $150,000 cost basis, tax free. It can take as many years as it needs. Is it even legal to sell at Dec 31st and rebuy Jan 1st?",2024-02-09,0

When you invest with Equityzen, investments are usually structured as parts of a funds. In other words, Equityzen acquires shares of a pre-IPO company and converts it to a fund and sell it to retail investors. So what you own is a part of a fund that owns shares of a single pre-IPO company.

As you are a LLP (limited liability partnership), Equityzen has a sole discretion whether to participate in a tender offer (i.e., a process of pre-IPO company buying back their shares).

My problem is that Equityzen usually opts in tender offers. Although I made a handsome profit of 200% from tender offers over a couple of years, my expectation is not to step out with such early profit, but to hold them longer until IPO (or being sold to a big company) for a greater profit.

My another concern regarding tender offers is that pre-IPO companies may buy back a large number of shares before going for IPO to maximise the capital inflow. If Equityzen opts in tender offer at such stage, then a risk-to-reward ratio of my pre-IPO investment would be  damaged substantially.

So I am searching for a broker where I can directly own shares.

\- Which brokers are you investing with?

\- When a company goes for IPO (or sold to a bigger company), your broker updates you the news and advise your next step (e.g., how to sell your shares)?

\- does your broker also updates you major news or deal of the company such as tender offers or others?

Any advise would be appreciated. Thank you so much in advance for sharing your experience.

At the moment I have a significant position in Gorilla Technologies Group, GRRR. It has a fairly high short interest rate of 280% and the shorts are utilized 100%.

So enabling short lending would earn me a few thousand dollars every month:

But I just checked the regulations, and my broker states:  
'The provisions of the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (""SIPA"") may not protect you as a   
lender with respect to securities loan transactions in which you lend your Fully-Paid Securities. Therefore, the collateral delivered to you (and indicated on your account statement) may

2247,The Stigma of Stock Picking,0,1al4igr,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1al4igr/the_stigma_of_stock_picking/,88,"Stock picking often gets a bad rap, therefore redditor's often default to suggesting new investors purchase the S&P or any comparable fund. Though this could be considered the safe route, it does little to teach new investors about the market as a whole. 

Stock picking is like a dark art, and is something I vowed to learn and master early on (or at least quit losing money in). Firstly, diversification is important. There's no way around it. Your level of diversification can vary, but owning an excessive amount of companies will only assure you'll do average at best.

Many give Cramer flak, but there's one comment he'd often make I'd like to highlight: ""Buy best of the best"". If you opted to buy the best companies per sector, beating the market isn't impossible...but picking stocks is half of the equation. ""Buying a wonderful company at a fair price"" is the other half.

I often stress the psychology of investing. Something I didn't become cognizant of until I started day trading. The market often pulls in new investors during euphoria, and this is the absolute worst time to invest. 

Many novice (and somewhat experienced) investors can't stomach market corrections, so be mindful of the affect a correction can have on someone who got in at the highs during euphoric conditions. A 10% drop in a stock isn't something to lose sleep over for someone who's up 100% or so...but imagine the affect a 10% drop can have on a new investor. They'll likely want to stop the bleeding, considering they'll immediately be in the red. 

Resist following the herd. Usually when some shiny new thing is being touted on social media, smart money is already looking for the exit. Invest in companies you can understand. Invest in products you already use or would consider using, granted they have sustainable growth. I often avoided shopping at Walmart because it was always crowded. I decided to research the company to determine what that traffic translated to. That was around $52 a share. I realized when you turn on every computer, you were greeted by Microsoft Windows. That was $38 a share. It can be that simple.

Investors definitely shouldn't be deterred from stock picking. Just be cognizant of the business and disciplined in your entry.

I asked a similar question a week or so ago, but I think I misunderstood what my brokerage is offering, so I want to see if people here can explain better. I thought having settled currency in Yen was better because it would raise my floor at the risk of lowering my ceiling due to currency fluctuations. But the brokerage person just told me something different (even though another person told me something else a couple of weeks ago when I called).  


So I am thinking of buying Japanese Stock with my US brokerage account. My brokerage account offers settled currency in US Dollars and Japanese Yen.  


I'm trying to figure out if it makes sense have settled currency in Dollars or Yen.   


I thought having settled currency in dollars  meant that my investment in the site dashboard would show the Dollar equivalent when it comes to gains/ losses. So for example if the investment in yen went up 20%, but currency fluctuated where the yen got stronger, my actual investment gain in dollar might only be 15%. Whereas if it was in yen, then i would get the full 20% gain, and I only have the currency risk if i choose to convert.  


As my brokerage account is in US, it is probably more convenient to have things in dollars so that if i sell the investment, i don't need to convert to buy something like an ETF?  


Whereas if it is settled in Yen, I would have to convert back? The way the brokerage people told me was that the settled in yen make sense if you have yen in your account. I don't, but I can use the currency exchange feature to get the yen anyways.  


Does it actually matter in terms of potential gains/ losses or other Pros and Cons? The approximate exchange rate is 1 USD to 150 yen.. That is quite lopsided to the US Dollar... I do expect the yen to strengthen even if it is 1 USD to 120 or 130 yen in the future for example.   


TLDR: does it matter if i make my settled currency in Dollar vs Yen in regards to potential gains/ losses?  


Is there any pro or con that I am not aware of in buying in US dollar or Yen?

4. Silver is a non-digital asset. I cannot think of a physical asset that stores value better than silver, other than other precious metals or land / real estate. It has gone from $5 an ounce to $22 an ounce since 1975. It is important to me to own physical assets that will appreciate in value. 

5. It is a solid vehicle for transferring wealth to my children in the future.

It's a tale that intertwines with the very fabric of American history, innovation, and economic strategy, revealing why today, oil and gas investments stand as some of the most undervalued and tax-efficient yields in the world.

To encourage exploration and production after the past energy crisis, the U.S. government implemented a series of tax incentives. These were not merely financial perks but strategic tools aimed at securing the nation's energy independence. The Intangible Drilling Cost (IDC) deduction, for example, allowed companies to deduct expenses from drilling new wells, an essential move to keep the rigs turning and the oil flowing. Similarly, the Depletion Allowance recognized the inherent decrease in value of oil and gas fields as they were depleted, offering a way to offset this loss against income.

\- The Intangible Drilling Cost (IDC) and Depletion Allowance are tax incentives for the oil and gas industry in the U.S. The IDC lets companies deduct drilling costs immediately.  
\- The Depletion Allowance reduces taxes on income from wells to account for resource depletion. Both were introduced to boost investment in oil and gas exploration, aiding U.S. energy independence efforts.

\-Lease costs, like the expenses for leasing minerals and rights, can be spread out over the lease's duration, offering tax advantages over time. Tangible Drilling Costs (TDCs) cover equipment used in drilling and can be depreciated over seven years. These tax incentives, along with the strong return on investment (ROI) potential in direct energy investments, make the sector an attractive choice for investors seeking tax efficiency and profitability.

  
These incentives did more than just stimulate growth in the oil and gas sector; they wove it into the very economic and energy fabric of the nation, making the U.S. a global energy leader. Yet, as the world shifts towards renewable energy, the narrative around oil and gas has evolved. The irony is that, in this transition, oil and gas investments have become some of the most undervalued assets, despite their continuing critical role in powering the modern world.  
Even as we champion the rise of renewables and the march towards electrification, the reality remains: the modern world continues to rely on the efficiency and flexibility of oil and gas. This is especially true as we navigate the complexities of integrating renewable sources into our energy grid, which still requires the reliability and on-demand power that fossil fuels provide. The shift to a more electric and renewable future doesn't negate the value of oil and gas; rather, it highlights their enduring importance in our energy mix.  
The tax benefits initially crafted to ensure energy independence have, somewhat unexpectedly, positioned oil and gas investments as some of the best tax-efficient yields available. Investors who recognize this stand to not only gain from the sector's undervalued status but also contribute to a balanced and pragmatic approach to our energy future.

I think I did ok (didn't lose any money) but my returns weren't that good, all things considered. 3-4% for some years and 4-6% in other years. 

I was doing a more thorough audit of my finances this year and I regretted not just putting everything in a few choice ETFs...until I remind myself that I didn't know then what I know now. Plus there were other factors in the way such as family entanglements and unhealed mental illness. 

I initially thought that to be an Investor (TM) you needed to understand every single thing on every broadsheet and watch the markets 24/7...until I did more reading and spoke to a friend of mine who is a full-time investor and she says that she doesn't know all that. You need to know enough to make money consistently, that's it.

So I while do know what are alpha, beta, Sharpe Ratio, candlestick theory are etc...I just want to manage my money, I'm not trying to become a CPA. For what it's worth, most FAs that I speak to are impressed with my knowledge base. 

However, I believe in always being humble and learning more, hence this post. Is there a point to when you feel that you can go it alone? When Googling this question the answer that always comes back is ""everyone's situation is different"" different factors etc. But here I'm talking mainly about financial knowledge and how to apply it.

Basically at this point I would be happy to buy several Vanguard growth ETFs and kick back and relax while saving the fees that I pay my FA. As long as I am navigating any potential traps like not paying witholding taxes, I don't see any issues with that strategy as it's hard to beat the market. The S&P and related ETFs are gold standards for a reason, and some of the funds rebalance themselves.

&#x200B;

This 10% correction will set the stage for a massive economic situation to play out. The Federal Reserve will not want to abandon the inflation threat, so they are going to be aggressive at keeping interest rates high while doing nothing to control the National Debt.

&#x200B;

High interest rates will actually cause the Federal Reserve to have to increase the national debt, which in turn will cause inflation to come back over the Spring and Summer 2024 months.

&#x200B;

May FOMC - no rate cuts. Market will trade flat through the summer months. Economic situation with layoffs and job cuts will get worse. Banks will start to experience stress as they will be upside down in ""Bond gambling"" at a much faster rate than March 2023.

&#x200B;

September FOMC - Federal Reserve may have to institute emergency rate cuts, even with inflation running hot at 5% once again. This will cause a massive stock market crash, and being in September - right at the seasonal low for stock markets in general. S&P 500 could correct to 2,900 by January 2025.

&#x200B;

And the scary part - inflation may end up at 6% going into 2025 even if we have a major market crash, because the interest rate hikes do not address the cause of inflation.

Everyone in my family continues to tell me that buying is always superior to renting no matter the scenario. I'm not quite sure if this applies to my plan.  
  
I understand that buying real estate is powerful for many reasons (5x leverage 20% down, tax advantages, etc.) but what if:  
  
1. I plan to not marry or have any kids.  
  
2. I plan to ""die with zero"" meaning I want to die with as close to 0 dollars as possible since I'm not having any kids to pass any assets down to.

1. SP500 and renting will have a lot less maintenance (no HVAC guy, no plumber, etc.)

1. monthly mortgage is fixed but rent increases in dollar amount over time (but also take into consideration that SP500 also increases in dollar amount over time)  
  
2. Possibly borrow against value of the home?

We purchased our home in 2021. PP: $470,500. We put 20% down. Our mortgage is around $370K at 6.2% interest, variable rate. Current monthly payments are $2,100 which is basically only covering interest. Assessed value is $608K.  
  
We have put around $80K into the house in renovations and have done all the work ourselves, including the kitchen and bathroom, so there is some sweat equity in the home. A house across the street that was assessed at $672K sold for $642K a couple months ago. It is not nearly as nice as ours. I am not sure why the assessed value is higher considering ours is several sq. ft. larger, 2 floors ABOVE ground (as opposed to below ground) and we have a 2 car garage but I am definitely not going to complain (cause, property taxes).  
  
Needless to say, I do believe we have some equity in the home we'd be able to take out.  
  
We are looking to add an addition above our garage as a secondary suite. It is connected to our current home therefore it would not be classified as an accessory dwelling unit (ADU). We have had a contractor come look at it. The build would cost around $150K to add approx. 450-500 sq ft.  
  
To finance the build, we would need to borrow from a HELOC. What I've yet to understand is the interest rates on a HELOC in comparison to interest rates on our mortgage.  
  
The whole idea of this suite came about because our province is currently offering a forgivable loan up to $40,000 or 50% of construction costs, given you rent out the suite for below market rates for 5 years. 20% of the loan would be forgiven each year it is rented out. The below market rate in our area is \~$1,000/month. Therefore, we would be earning $12,000 gross rent + $8,000 loan forgiveness for the first 5 years, therefore, $100K. In addition, it is unclear whether a secondary suite would add the same amount of value to the home as it would cost. I am not sure whether a $150K suite would add $150K to our eventual sale price. However, since it is our principal residence, also consider the entire gain on the home would be excluded except for the rental portion of the property. Therefore, 450sq ft / 2,600 sq ft x cap gain on sale x (# of years lived in / # of years owned +1 year) = taxable gain x 50% effective tax rate (currently, 18%, but will increase).  
  
We live in a boaters/sledders town. The summer months are VERY busy in our community and winter brings about sledders too. After the 5-year period, we could airbnb the secondary suite and earn even more rental income.  
  
My partner asked 'well what would $150K look like if we invested it rather than built this secondary suite?' She is very against sharing a wall or any of our property with other people. My father-in-law gave me an example that conservatively, every 7 years your investment should double. Therefore, in 7 years $150K should = $300K.

Even a very small risk of losing money over time is a scary thought. Although I know it‚Äôs almost guaranteed to be better than CDs/HYSA in the long term. I still can‚Äôt help but prefer the safety that especially CDs provides.

Im just wondering if you strategically go for the highest rates offered whether HYSA or CDs, and use CD laddering when rates are high, if it can generally beat inflation in the long term. The last few years it‚Äôs clear it hasn‚Äôt. As inflation and available interest rates where very disproportionate. However recently with savings accounts offering 4+% and cds over 5% it seems to be an actual safe investment that at least slightly beats out inflation. although still very low when accounting for after tax profit.

But in the long term is it a bad idea to try and strategically use cds/hysa as a way of beating inflation? Especially when accounting for profit loss from taxes? Is it only ever a way of slowing down the effects of inflation rather than beating it?

On the one hand, I appreciate the ""thanks for your hard work"" offer, but at the same time, this feels like gambling. As far as I know, the company has no plans to go public in the next few years.   


The company is in series B and has so far had 3 rounds of investment since being founded.   


All I knew to ask so far was what happens if I leave. They said they will buy the shares back. Every year they will also have a set period where we can sell them back. So they could technically choose the period in the year when they're at their cheapest I guess. But also since this is a private company, who decides what the shares are worth?  


Please tell me what I need to ask the company to find out more. So far I'm leaning towards a hard ""no thanks"" simply because I don't know enough about the company's financials, or if I get taxed when I sell them back (I'm in Asia), or who controls the price of the shares.

2. Cash flow planning - helping clients envision how much money they‚Äôd need to make a significant purchase (new home, relocation, etc), or to retire. 
3. Legal/estate planning - I not only provide initial suggestions for estate planning, I refer my clients to an attorney specifically selected from my network and I also sit in on every call they have with the attorney throughout the estate planning process. I act as the coordinator for every project and am with clients each step of the way. 
4. Tax advisory- my firm provides in house tax advice, and I have connections with CPAs, corporate tax planners, and tax attorneys. If a client is in need of any of these professionals, I also sit in on each of these calls to ensure I can manage a clients project properly.
5. Balance sheet management - I only get paid for my AUM, but I also advise on items that I can‚Äôt manage. I will provide input outside investment opportunities clients get from their personal networks or other investment institutions. I discuss writing individual checks to startup companies, and participate in conversations about cryptocurrency investments.

2)Historically,are returns higher if you dollar cost average monthly vs quarterly? 

Background/context


The reason why I am asking this is simple: I am buying NASDQ and S&P500 based in Eurooean stock exchanges because they have to be UCITs compliant and none of those are available in US stock markets. 

These ETFs are identical to the ones traded in the US and have barely any differences in returns unless they are hedged to another currency which increases or decreases returns based on the exchange rate. 

European stock exchanges have high comissions and clearing fees and bigger volumes mean it's cheaper for me to invest quarterly vs monthly.

The second reason I invest quarterly is because I need to maintain a high amount of savings for a number of reasons and that treshold is a minimum of 9 months of savings. 

I could list those reasons but that would make this post unnecessarily long.

I have been investing for some time now, I have ETFs and individual stocks.  
To select individual stocks, I use several websites to collect the appropriate information and to be able to filter for certain characteristics. I am now subscribed to FastGraphs basic and I also use the free versions of Yahoo Finance, Barchart, Finviz and tradingview for the technical part.

  
I spend quite a lot of time gathering information from several places, so I thought I'd rather subscribe to a website where I can put together a couple of screeners, so I don't have to jump between several pages and I can find the companies that may be relevant to me faster.

  
Info I need: at least 8-10 years of income, expenses, profit, forecasts, historical valuation indicators, Current ratio, ROA, ROE indicators for each company would be available.  
So far, I have collected them in Excel, this is quite a lengthy process, but at least I have seen the companies of the given sector side by side with all relevant indicators.

  
Lately, I mostly use finviz, but unfortunately there is no European share on this site, or only very limited ones. Regardless, I like and am thinking about Finviz Elite.

  
Since then, I've heard about gurufocus and many people have recommended it, but I don't know if it's worth the $450 a year.

  
Also, there is the premium version of FastGraphs, which costs quite a bit, and I don't know if it would be worth the similar price as Gurufocus, seeing the professionalism of GF.

  
What website did you use/would you recommend for a value investor like me? :)

Characteristics | VUTA (Treasury) | VAGU (Global Aggregate)

Effective Yield to Maturity | 4.10% | 3.80%
Average Maturity          | 7.9 years | 8.8 years
Average Duration          | 6.2 years | 6.8 years
Average Quality | AA+ | AA-
TER | 0.07% | 0.10%

I thought the higher YTM and (presumably) lower default risk mean that VUTA will have a higher expected return, but [Vanguard's own 10-year forecast](https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/vemo/vemo-return-forecasts.html) predicts a better return from global bonds instead:

Forecast |U.S. aggregate bonds|Global bonds ex-U.S. (hedged)|U.S. Treasury bonds

10Y return projection|4.8%-5.8%|4.7%-5.7%|4.4%-5.4%
Median volatility|5.60%|4.40%|5.90%

Where can the \~1% excess return possibly come from? And when combined with stock funds in a portfolio, should I pick VUTA based on the higher effective YTM and a lower market correlation, or VAGU due to a higher predicted return despite the lower effective YTM? Thanks for your help.

&#x200B;

We have no mortgage, no car loans, we're DINKs, and only just opened a outstanding loan for replacing some of our windows and french doors in the house. 38 years old, wife is 39.

&#x200B;

I'm questioning right now if having this insurance does anything at all - as honestly when I pass away my 401K has a lot more money than this life insurance policy will pay out. My employer offers a $1m term policy they pay for, but at this point with no debts excluding that new loan, and enough cash to pay that off tomorrow if I wanted, I don't see any real benefit my wife or I would receive from any life insurance that I would have to pay for - and I'm really really thinking of just cashing this whole life policy out and putting the cash value into my Roth IRA. 

&#x200B;

I can see how someone with a huge load of debt would want enough life insurance to cover paying those loans off when they die so their family is not stuck with the loans - but when you are on the other end of that bridge debt free, I just don't see any benefit at all to life insurance if you have cash that will be passed along to beneficiaries.

My basic understanding is that term life insurance is useless because everyone in my family lives to 80+ years old and I am under 30 so a 30 year policy will result in lost money.

Sadly, when her husband died she wasn't in a great place mentally and just merged everything together and now we don't know what portion was contributions.  Also, it's been rolled over at least once from a different broker. 

What is the best way to find out what the 'contribution' portion of her IRA account is so that we can pull from that without touching the 'growth' and creating a taxable/penalty-able event?

34M located in NY.  305k in 401/457 accounts total as of today. 

Railroad employee for 10 years. 20 more to go and I will meet the requirement for retiring as a railroad conductor (30 years of service and age 55 minimum to collect a NYS defined pension with the MTA with no penalty. 60% of average of top 3 consecutive years in your last 10 of service. It is subject to cost of living increased)

Current pay 50 dollars an hour, with eye dental and medical all covered by employer. (Labor Contract expired by 2 years so we are due for a raise and retro). Also have had the options for overtime. 

I do not pay in to social security, I pay into railroad retirement. If I have 30 years of railroad service in my life, I will be able to collect my full railroad retirement pension as well at 60 years old instead of 62.  I believe it pays much more than Social Security, and is privately funded by the railroads so hopefully I am safe in the future with that.  My wife will be able to collect an additional 50% of my 100% regardless of if/ any she pays into social security.  Railroad retirement will either pay her  or allow her to collect SS come age if their payout is higher. 

My employer does not match anything into the 401(k) or 457, but they give me the option to have both. They provide the defined pension when I retire from service at 55 years old until I die, then my spouse takes over the payouts. They also cover my medical until I turn 65.  

I‚Äôm sure they do not match because they are providing with a defined pension.

I will not discuss my saving size as I have invested a lot into my house I purchased in 2022 because I bought it for a deal so I needed to provide a lot of equity upfront.   It needed an addition and lots of renovations. 


My only debt is my mortgage which is at 220,000 currently. Both cars are paid off and I have no credit card debt.

My biggest concern is the 401/457 when it comes time at 60 years old and am able to start using it, or if I die leave it to my family. I have a 300k life insurance policy as well. 

Does it look like I should be in a decent position? Any advice is appreciated. I have always had anxiety about money, because my mother was put in a position where we did not have a lot growing up.",2024-02-02,0

Overtime, once the general market corrects I was planning on moving the $100K into something longer term, perhaps a Roth IRA? But not 100% sure.

I‚Äôm slightly concerned that I don‚Äôt have enough to build a reasonable amount by the time I want to retire. Was curious about my plan and if it makes sense or if I‚Äôm way off.

According to a few calcs I‚Äôm confident in my ability to retire within the next 0-3 years though I‚Äôm still unsure.

AA is 72/28 though some have told me to get more aggressive. 

Currently unemployed due to a layoff. 

Annual budget is $52k and accounts for increasing healthcare expenses, though doesn‚Äôt account for the cost of a retirement home or hospice. 

Specific question: A while back I moved my brokerage to a new institution and unknowingly locked about 8 years of VTSAX covered shares into average cost basis. The rest of my brokerage is SpecID. The 8 years of VTSAX is a hefty portion of my brokerage. This means less control over cap gains and fewer chances to TLH. How do I take this into account when determining whether I‚Äôm ready to retire early? Is it relevant for a FIRE calculation?

I plan to stay just for this year and swap to another broker next year but in the meantime where should I allocate those 22.5k (and possibly more depending on how our 2023 tax will come up)
I'm thinking of doing 60% vti, 30% qqqm and 10% vigi.

1) Stay with Schwab but switch to Schwab funds (SWPPX, Maybe SWSSX I don‚Äôt think Schwab has SCV, and SWISX). 

2) switch to Vanguard but use only Vanguard funds (VOO, VIOV, and VXUS).

It's been doing well for me but I have a friend that advocates dumping my etfs and focusing on more tech etfs. Over the past couple years his gains have absolutely obliterated mine, but as a long term investor, this doesn't really bother me. That being said, historically speaking, tech sector does seem to GENERALLY outperform the broad market. I've always heard that you really shouldn't try to beat the S&P over the long term because most people who try fail. This is advice I have always agreed with but it seems like tech sector does actually generally beat S&P. You can obviously cherry pick examples of when it doesn't, but you would need to do just that, cherry pick. The fact that my friends portfolio has been obliterating mine, in combination with the historical data (I initially thought it was just recency bias) I am starting to think his strategy might be better. I also happen to believe in the future of tech, I think the sector will look very different as time goes on but a future in which tech isn't the dominant market sector seems a bit unfathomable. It's nothing like the sectors of old, it certainly would not have been unfathomable to me that oil might one day not be the dominant sector. I also don't really consider Tech a ""sector"" it's more like multiple sectors under one umbrella so it has some inherent diversification. My mindset around diversification is shifting from diversification = good to diversification = important investing tool but can be both good and bad. I know some people who diversify so much that their gains are not much better than simply having a high yield savings account... in that case just get a high yield savings account lol. Lastly, because Tech is such a dominant sector, if tech goes down I feel like my diversification won‚Äôt really save me. My losses may be a little less extreme, but probably not much. Am I forgoing huge gains to MAYBE save myself a little in the event of a tech crash?",2024-02-01,0

- Maturity: 2024-05-31
- Payments until maturity: one, on maturity date
- Payment upon maturity: 100

My understanding if that because there aren't any compounding periods the YTM should equal ROI. In this case:

`ROI = [(100-99.149)+2.5]/99.149 = 3.38%`

Lithium has also taken a hit over the last few months but the industry will be riffed with aggressive consolidation via M&A throughout 2024 - this might favor a lot of US/nearshore junior miners.

Is now a good time to accumulate lithium while it's cheap? I mean, the green transition will ultimately be heavily dependent on lithium as a foundational metal (car batteries, electronics, etc). There are also no real viable replacements (sodium-ion, hydrogen cells, etc are just liquidity traps / R&D grant money syphoning affinity scams).

Are we underestimating the risk of index funds in the long run? It seems on every financial subreddit, the advice is usually to invest in index funds. This is good, for now... but past performance is not an indicator of future performance. And each year, we are heading closer towards a market future dominated by index funds, an index fund tracking the index funds.

I think two very real possibilities that people need to consider in this future index fund dominated market; either a), the returns will be much lower due to too much passive investing or b) actively managed funds will out-perform passive investing.

Imagine a world dominated by index funds. If I buy stock from any company (even a bad one) I will drive up its share price and thus its index weight and force the passive investors along, which will further drive up the price at which I can sell a bit later, so I can easily front run the passive investors and will massively outperform them.  
Passive investing is depending on enough active investment happening, it needs to be in an equilibrium, if there is too much going on on the passive side, the active investors have a front-running advantage that will outweigh their higher cost of operations and they will outperform passive. If there are many active investors their front-running advantage is too small to outweigh their cost, and passive investors will outperform them because of that. That is the situation we're still in.

----

I understand how a simple bond works, and I half-remember the discounted cashflow formula I was taught in university, but these only apply to bonds held to maturity. I'm trying to grok pricing of bonds that are being (re)sold at the market.

I opened up the ""bonds"" tab and the first result (alphabetically) was [Austria 2.1% 17/17, ISIN: AT0000A1XML2](https://www.boerse-frankfurt.de/bond/at0000a1xml2-oesterreich-republik-2-1-17-17). Not exactly a great example as it is a government bond and probably influenced by EU policies at large, but oh well. What I see is:

- Bond pricing on start date: marked as ""100"" (?), as in ""a share of the bond costs 100‚Ç¨ to buy"". 
- Maturity: When you get back the 100‚Ç¨ you paid on start date, in ~93 years.
- Coupon (2.1%): You get 2.1% per year until maturity on the 100 invested (or 2.1‚Ç¨).
- Price: How much you need to pay to buy that 1 share today, i.e. ~74‚Ç¨.

I hope that's okay so far. Now comes the guesswork:

- Yearly: If I buy that bond at ~74‚Ç¨, the 2.1% coupon rate, then my expected yield is 2.1‚Ç¨ / 74‚Ç¨ = 2.837% per year
- At maturity: I get paid 100‚Ç¨

With the above, I can calculate the value: sum of all coupons until maturity, plus initial capital, or `93 * 2.1 + 100 = 295.3`. Then, I need to discount by **only one** (?) semi-magical number which I can pick as either inflation or the ""risk-free asset"" or any alternative asset (e.g. S&P500)? E.g. say I pick 2%, I would calculate the present value something like this: `295.3 / (1.02  ^ 93) ~= 46.82`.\*\*

Does that make any sense? Am I missing something? And \*if the above *is* correct (plus/minus some number variation), is that how bond pricing mostly works, and are the discrepancies in present value vs price the expected loss/reward?

Edit: 

\*\* Discounting based on time as the first comment suggests and verifying my calculations [using a calculator](https://www.calculator.net/finance-calculator.html?ctype=startingamount&cyearsv=93&cinterestratev=2&cstartingprinciplev=20%2C000&ccontributeamountv=-2.1&ctargetamountv=-100&cpy=1&ccy=1&ciadditionat1=end&printit=0&x=Calculate#cr) as the other comment suggested, the present value is ~104.21",2024-01-30,0

E.g.

I just sold a portion of my apple shares (35 shares) in which I had at an ACB of $95. Equals about $3,330 net investment

The proceeds of the sale at current price ($190) was about $6,600

I used that $6,600 to buy 16 MSFT and 1 AMD. If I now want to note my ACB‚Äôs for sake of my net investments I used the $3,330 number as my investment so the breakdown is as follows

16 MSFT = about $3,240 = $202/share
1 AMD = about $90/share

MSFT trading at $410
AMD trading at $178

Essentially since I didn‚Äôt add any new cash, and used my gains from Apple would it make sense to use the $202 and $90 as my share values.

2453,All Public Pensions Funds Are Around 25 Percent Of Their Proclaimed Net Assets - Especially Calpers,0,1aepf5e,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1aepf5e/all_public_pensions_funds_are_around_25_percent/,38,"When are the members of public pension ever going to figure out that  
the numbers that they get are not accurate.   
if amazon stock trades at 100x earnings. Obviously this equity, which is representative of the entire stock market for its absurd valuation so far beyond its actual earning capability is a mockery of the intention of equity markets.   
on the balance sheet of the pension fund it has a ""paper gain""  
meaning the stock trades at 100x earnings so on paper the equity trades at 200 per share but in reality, it is really worth 25 x earnings due to its 15 percent growth rate, and not the highest quality management.   
that means that if interest rates were ever competitive than the price of the stock would effectively be cut by 75 percent, meaning the balance sheet of CALPERS, the California teachers pension fund would be in tatters. The reason is that these companies do not have earnings that substantiate their market caps.  
NONE of them do.  
For whatever reason the fiduciaries of Calpers have not told their membership that in order for their pension to be good, they need to have investments.   
To have investments, you need to be allowed to make investments.   
you cannot make investments without FREE FLOATING DEBT  
Meaning, you need a free market with debt. Or else, then the stock market gets so much capital that it becomes uninvestable, which is exactly what happened.  
Yet, the calpers financial management, act like its 2003, when there was a free market in debt.  
This is like reminiscent of bernie madoff style scam.   
The reason is the debt markets were socialized.   
You cannot have investments without price discovery  
Hilarious enough, the people who complain about ""wealth inequality"" have   
literally without exaggeration, made it impossible to get earnings from bank deposits and the stock market because THEY and also the republicans did not protest strongly, for a SUSPENSION of FREE FLOATING INTEREST RATES.  
LITERALLY INTEREST RATE PRICE CONTROLS.  
So,thereby making money worthless for investment.  
Anyone who buys an equity today like amazon will VIRTUALLY NEVER get a return from the stock in their LIFETIME.  
WHY haven't pension fund managers who get paid millions of dollars a year tell their membership that their pensions are threatened and COMPLETELY unsustainable without having free floating interest rates?  
This is criminal level negligence. They continue drawing their checks as if nothing is awry.  
Some estimates indicate that Calpers is in reality only 25 percent funded.

I'm not talking about OTC or ADR, or the pink sheet. I am talking about buying actual stock on the actual foreign exchange.

So if I am using USD and JPY as example:

If I buy in USD, the % gain or unrealized gain I see already includes the potential gains/ loss from the changes of the currency exchange rate between the two currency at that point in time (built in currency exchange risk is reflected)?

Whereas if I buy in yen, the % gain or unrealized gain I see is the gain from the investment only. The actual gain/ loss could be greater/ lower depending on whether the yen got stronger or weaker compared to my initial investment currency exchange rate (currency exchange rate is not reflected)?

and if i expect the yen to strengthen to the dollar, buying in yen would hedge against currency risk at the cost of slightly lower gains? This would mean higher floor and lower ceiling?

Does it matter if, when/if I withdrawal, I'll be withdrawing in USD (as I can't use Yen in the US) anyways that I have it in one currency or the other? Because to me, the actual money I'll be getting in the end is the same, it is just a matter of whether the % gain of the portfolio is higher/lower due to currency fluctuation... though if I buy in USD, and the currency fluctuation decreases my % gain, maybe I might pay less taxes?

Like let say I buy at the same time and sell at the same time, my real gain/losses would be the same if I were to buy with Dollars or yen (convert back to dollars after sell) right? Lets say actual investment gains is 10%, but currency gains/losses X%.

If I buy with dollars, the % gain/losses I see on the website would be the 10% + X% or 10%-X% built in already right?

Whereas the yen, the % gain and losses I see on the website would only be the 10%, and I would need to factor in the X% movement on the currency?

So it basically doesn't matter at the end?",2024-01-29,0

2485,Stock Ownership - Capital Gains vs Dividends,11,1adwg9t,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1adwg9t/stock_ownership_capital_gains_vs_dividends/,36,"Hi everyone,

I would like to get a bit of insight from you guys concerning the real purpose of stock ownership.

Traditionally, one purchased public traded stocks to become an equity owner of a company. And, as an owner -- albeit a very, very small stakeholder -- you received your share of the company's profits as a dividend. Today, this still true.

However, for the past many, many decades, the most popular way to earn a return on your stock investment for companies that don't pay a dividend is solely through capital gains. The capital gains don't come from the company, but from whatever you sell your shares to.

My question is, how can a stock shareholder be an ""owner"" of the a public traded company, if the return comes from a buyer via capital gains, versus the truest way to be an ""owner"" through dividends?

It makes sense that dividends are your share of the company's profits. But, with capital gains from a stock that doesn't pay dividends, you aren't profiting from the company's profits like a real owner.

Capital gains are simply the price another person is willing to pay  The capital gains aren't fringe the company.

Furthermore, the only legal thing a company gas to do concerning your shares is to pay you the PAR VALUE of those shares as stated in the company's financial statements.

So, if you own one share of a stock that is currently trading as $50 a share, that stock's par value could be something like $0.0001 per share for example.

What are your opinions and insights concerning this issue?

Does relying on capital gains really make you an equity owner in a company that doesn't pay dividends?

Thanks!

That is ironic, since no one disapproved of the excesses of Wall Street in the 1980s so much as  the chairman of the Fed, Paul Volcker. At a rare Saturday press conference, on October 6, 1 ?79, Volcker announced that the money supply would cease to fluctuate with the business cycle; money supply would be fixed, and interest rates would float. The event, I think, marks the beginning of the golden age of the bond man. Had Volcker never pushed through his radical charge in policy, the world would be many bond traders and one memoir the poorer. For in practice, the shift in the focus of monetary policy meant that interest rates would swing wildly. Bond prices move inversely, lockstep, to rates of interest. Allowing interest rates to swing wildly meant allowing bond prices to swing wildly. Before Volcker's speech, bonds had been conservative investments, into which investors put their savings when they didn't fancy a gamble in the stock market.

Seedrs and AllPlants,0,1adavih,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1adavih/can_big_crowdfunding_companies_be_sued_for_their/,6,"I am a normal investor who is still learning, back in 2020 COVID times I tried different approach to invest into startup company which was advertised on my delivery box. I used to be AllPlants subscriber box meal. I remember large 6, 1000 calorie meals which were vegan and super tasty cost ¬£59 so during COVID I subscribed due to lack of time to cook

My box had a leaflet saying we are crowdfunding and it was during times when everything was climbing up in price, people forgot about fears of recession and everyone felt like was in the mood to buy so they don't miss out on bargains.

AllPlants crowdfunding went so well in first stage mainly because they advertised as 20% share price discount so I think they raised 3.4m they beat few records. There were headlines. Even UK prime minister was seen with AllPlants box delivery outside.

I bought into that stage ¬£1,000 EIS. Valuation was at ¬£17.51 per share so I guess their real valuation was ¬£22 per share as I was getting 20% discount.

Valuation of shares came at ¬£25.89 later in 2021

In 2022 I bought another ¬£1,000 worth now at ¬£25.89 stupidly thinking I already made 30% profit they might have potential to grow.

For some reason mid 2022 things were going down and negative outlook on media made me realise I want to cash in on my A2 EIS shares I bought at ¬£17.51 so I started selling them as they were available to sell on Seedr website.

I managed to offload about ¬£1000 worth of shares at about 10-20% loss just trying to get rid of them but getting later to end of 2022 Seedr disabled AllPlants to be on secondary market so I was no longer able to place orders for people to buy. I was confused, as I remember it was something to do with valuations and AllPlants cannot be on secondary market due to some regulations.

I stopped putting effort into selling and forgot about this account fast forward to 2024 I thought I'd login to see what my shares are doing and if I can sell or did they grow.

Turns out in July 2023 valuation of AllPlants and new share price came at ¬£1.61 can you believe it? 
So 29 Sept 2021 is ¬£25.89
But on 5 July 2023 is ¬£1.61

I can imagine what you already thinking, when you invest into start ups and do crowdfunding it is only your fault to invest into something so fragile but thinking more about this situation making me realise this was like investing into crypto or penny stocks but we are talking about food delivery company which still delivers today.

I am not even angry about losing ¬£900 ish, it was rather a lesson but what makes me angry and confused is how is it possible that Seedr biggest crowdfunding website in UK gets away with it. How is it possible they came and valued AllPlants at 89,000,000 but 2 years later they said this company is worth 9,000,000. After all Seedrs website says ""selected and managed by experts"". 

I don't know much about startup companies but I understand during COVID their sales must of been higher and I can guess their sales are way lower logically but why can the experts get away with valueing companies wrongly and overinflate prices and then investors lose money.

Almost feels like their website slogan is wrong instead of saying
""Don't invest unless you're prepared to lose all the money you invest""
Should say 
""We will make sure that you lose money after we over inflate the valuation of the company you invest in then drop it down to normal value""


And you could say my shares were diluted and I received extra shares, no after holding 97 shares I recieved only 9 shares due to dilution and instead of portfolio value of roughly ¬£900-1000 it is now worth ¬£83.41.

Surely these things need to be regulated or normal investors will lose big money the fact that when I tried to sell AllPlants shares and seedr disabled them on secondary market sounds dodgy. How are people who value companies wrong don't lose their jobs and pay price like investors do and AllPlants have the largest kitchen in Europe apparently.

Same with cannabis and tobacco. I hate cigarettes and fully support cannabis legalization and want to ride that wave up to the top. But I just know Philip Morris is gonna move a significant portion of their production line to cannabis once the government makes it feasible to be the biggest player in that field.

And in terms of defense and arms stocks, I hate guns and war. Yet I know that peace isn't possible without countries arming themselves to the teeth to prevent invasion, and fully support the defense of Ukraine and Israel. Plus, you can't really buy ""peace"" stocks.

I was laid off. Company used to be public but was acquired by two major private equity firms just before I started working there. 

I have 1500 NSOs (non qualified options), exercise price is $10. Fair market value is not disclosed by the company but documentation says: The exercise price per Common Unit to be purchased upon exercise of an Option shall not be less than the Fair Market Value on the Grant Date.

The company doesn‚Äôt offer an exchange. Liquidity only comes with them going public again. 

If I exercise, the company has the right to repurchase at the current fair market value. Also, if I exercise, and the company does not repurchase, I will hold them until a sale event, if one occurs. 

How can I assess the fair market value? I read the company can reprice options at any time. 

Tax implications of NSOs mean two rounds of taxation, similar to RSUs I think:

When you exercise your company stock options, you‚Äôll be taxed on the difference between your strike price (fixed purchase price) and the current FMV of those stock options

If you sell your stock within a year of when you exercised your options, you‚Äôll pay short-term capital gains tax on any increase in value since the exercise date. If you sell after more than a year, you pay long term capital gains tax. 

I have the cash to cover the options (the cost is a small portion of my total portfolio value) though it‚Äôs hard to say whether this is a smart move. The company is a leader in its market and the private equity firms are big players who clearly want to set up the company for M&A.

You are given two choices to invest your savings:  
A) You get 10$  
B) 50% chance of getting 20$, otherwise 0$  
Mathematically wise, this is the same. However I was questionning two things:  
First, risk of course. I think people in general would prefer having 10$ each time rather than 20$ half of the time.  
Second, marginal value. IF you did econ in your life, you know that the more you get something, the less it is ""useful"" (marginal utility is a concave function). Thus, in our case, choice B would give less utility than choice A. In that case, how much money would, if divided by two give the same utility as 10$ each time. (Let there be a choice C where:  
U(10$) = U(X$)/2  
U(1000$) = U(X$)/2  
U(10000000$) = U(X$)/2  
Provided this, we can observe that X is not constant but a function. (People wouldnt really care about receiving 2$ 50% of the time instead of 1$ but would care if they received 100M 50% of the time instead of 50M).

By Hermes Lux

The banking sector will soon experience another wave of failures and consolidation as the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), a lifeline for struggling banks, is set to expire in March 2024. 

The BTFP is a Fed program that provides loans of up to one year to eligible depository institutions (mostly small banks) pledging collateral eligible for purchase by the Federal Reserve Banks. The program was created in March 2023, after the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, to lend to other banks that had big unrealized losses on their holdings of government bonds and were, therefore, at risk of large-scale withdrawals of deposits. The Fed has no plans to renew the BTFP for a very specific reason. 

The BTFP has helped many banks survive the past year with surging interest rates, which caused a significant decrease in the market value of the U.S. Treasury and government-backed mortgage securities held by banks. However, the program is scheduled to end in March, leaving many banks vulnerable to liquidity and solvency problems. Some of these smaller banks are likely to fail in Spring 2024.

According to a recent report by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic Bank last year cost the agency $18.7 billion. The FDIC imposed a special assessment on 114 financial institutions totaling $16.3 billion to recover lost funds, but they know the money will never be recovered. That‚Äôs the whole point. JPMorgan Chase $JPM, Bank of America $BAC, Wells Fargo $WFC, and Citigroup $C paid the largest assessments, which dragged on fourth-quarter earnings, as expected and as according to plan.

These are the 4 largest banks in the US with more than $12 Trillion in assets combined.  These four banks are too big to fail. Behind the scenes it is also these four banks that make up the majority of the direct influence of the cartel that is the Federal Reserve System, which, despite its name, is not Federal nor is it a government system. 

Recently, the FDIC warned that more bank failures are expected in March and April 2024, as many smaller banks are unable to repay their BTFP loans or cope with the rising debt burden. The agency said that it is working closely with the Federal Reserve (the Cartel) and other regulators (US Treasury) to monitor the situation and ensure the stability of the banking system. In other words, it‚Äôs for the greater good, and in the end, the bank consolidation will justify the decision by the FDIC, Treasury and the Fed. 

Ultimately , the Fed is trying to consolidate small banks into larger ones, as part of its strategy to reduce the systemic risk and complexity of the financial sector. The central bank (cartel) is said to be offering incentives and regulatory relief to encourage mergers and acquisitions among lesser banks, especially those with assets below $10 billion.

The banking industry Is facing a critical moment, as the expiration of the BTFP will likely trigger another round of failures and consolidation. The outcome of this process will have significant implications for the economy, the financial system, and the depositors.

I‚Äôm not a naturally math-savvy guy, would the compounding growth over some constant accounts make the portfolio grow better than the other 2 options?

2. index tracked fund: Classic VOO. If it‚Äôll get put in there and not touched over 30+ years, I know it‚Äôll grow (assuming S&P do what S&P do). Again, without running down a rabbit hole would this outperform a consistent DRIP account?

I want to share my thoughts on Booking as a company since I think Booking is interesting. If you're looking for a superficial analysis and don't like reading, look elsewhere. This isn't a superficial analysis, which is what is typically shared. I'll share why I think Booking might be differentiated from major competitors like Expedia and AirBnb. I'll also do an overview of the economics of the business, then write about the industry and competitors and estimate the intrinsic value. As I am sure all of you know, this is just my thoughts so please do your own research. I hope I provide some insights and I welcome an exchange of ideas.

# Company Overview:

Booking is an online travel agency (OTA). It is a parent company that holds a number of brands such as Booking, KAYAK, RentalCars, Priceline, Agoda and Opentable. As a whole, Booking provides reservation services for customers looking for accommodations, flights, rental cars, taxis, and restaurants. There is a lot interplay between these brands.

Booking categories their revenue as Agency, Merchant & Advertising & Other:

Revenue *(In millions)*

||**2022**|**2021**|**2020**|**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**2016**|**2015**|2014|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Agency|$9,003|$6,663|$4,314|$10,117|$10,480|$9,714|$7,982|$6,527|$5,845|
|Merchant|$7,193|$3,696|$2,117|$3,830|$2,987|$1,891|$1,620|$1,450|$1,329|
|Advertising & Other|$894|$599|$365|$1,119|$1,060|$834|$713|$613|$410|
|**Total**|**$17,090**|**$10,958**|**$6,796**|**$15,066**|**$14,527**|**$12,439**|**$10,314**|**$8,591**|**$7,584**|

Booking mainly generates revenue on commissions. Agency revenue is when Booking makes a reservation for a customer but does not facilitate payment; the supplier (hotels, airlines, etc) will follow up with the customer for payment. Merchant revenue is when Booking acts as a merchant; i.e. collect payment and remits payment to supplier. Bookings earns commission on both of these categories.

Merchant revenue is catching up and increasing its percentage as a proportion of total revenue and although this doesn't negatively impact Booking in regards to its position in the industry, it does negatively impact their margins.

Operating Margins: 

|**2014**|**2015**|**2016**|**2017**|**2018**|**2019**|**2020**|**2021**|**2022**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|42.2%|40.5%|37.92%|28.18%|36.48%|36.7%|35.48%|\-9.28%|22.78%|

\*We can see that as the merchant category increases as a proportion of sales, operating margins are decreasing. Merchant revenue incurs additional expenses.

***Advertising & Other*** is revenue mainly earned by KAYAK for its meta-search platform: This platform lists hotel chains, flights, etc on its website. ***I am going to disregard this segment because Google Flights does the same thing, so I am estimating no growth here. Some people view Google as a competitor to Booking, and they do compete against KAYAK. However, Google benefits Booking's Agency and Merchant business since Google refers a lot of people to Bookings platforms. Google is ultimately an advertising business, they don't make reservations or facilitate payments.***

Marketing Expense as a % of Total Revenue: 

|**2022**|**2021**|**2020**|**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**2016**|**2015**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|35%|34.6%|32%|32.9%|34.1%|36.2%|35.4%|35%|

\* Booking spends a lot on marketing and a lot of this spend is performance marketing on Google.

Room nights booked *(in mill):*

|**2022**|**2021**|**2020**|**2019**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|896|591|355|845|

\*What I like about this data is that room nights booked (one night booked = one room night) in 2022 is higher than 2019, which was the record prior to COVID. Room nights have been increasing significantly in geographical areas (like Asia-Pacific) which has lower average daily rates compared to areas like Europe and the U.S. This also impacts their margins.

# Competitors:

Bookings Mix of Room nights for hotels and alternative accommodation:

||||||
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
||**2022**|**2021**|**2020**|**2019**|
|Hotels, Motels, Resorts|70%|71%|\--|71%|
|Alternative|30%|29%|\--|29%|

**AirBnb:**

The way I am thinking about this is 70% of Bookings accommodations are in hotels and motels and AirBnb mainly generate revenue from homes, holiday houses etc. This is only 30% of Bookings business, which they list as alternative. Although these two companies compete, I don't think it will affect Booking if Airbnb continues to grow since they don't specialise in hotel accommodations. I am curious to know your thoughts about this.

**Website Traffic:**

Expedia: 88.68% website traffic in the U.S.

Airbnb: 71.54% website traffic in the U.S

***Booking: 10.86% website traffic in the U.S***

Most of Bookings website traffic is concentrated in Europe whereas Expedia and Airbnb is concentrated in the U.S. I believe this has other implications, especially when I compare Booking with Expedia that has a business model that is almost identical. Most of the hotel chains in the U.S are very popular: Marriott, Holiday Inn, Hilton, Hampton Inn and Hyatt to name a few. They have their own loyalty programs and big marketing and merchandising (cheap deals) campaigns and customers often seek these hotels out directly, although they are listed on Expedia as well. Since they are popular, they have bargaining power and can request lower commissions to be listed on an OTA. Since Expedia is heavily concentrated in the United States, this has an impact on their margins. Most of Bookings hotel suppliers are outside of the U.S. and these are often smaller, independent chains that rely more heavily on an OTA.

Expedia operating margins:

|**2022**|**2021**|**2020**|**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|10.2%|3%|\-29.4%|8%|7%|6.6%|

\*I think this explains why Expedia's margins are a lot lower than Booking despite similar business models.

# Industry:

OTA industry estimates suggest it will grow to over $1 trillion at the end of 2030. It is currently at $521 billion. Estimated growth is just over 10%.

# Intrinsic Value Estimate:

|Revenue|25%|47%|8%|11%|12%|
|FCF|19%|N/A (COVID)|8%|10%|11%|

I have taken the current year FCF estimate (2023 FY results isn't out yet), and have estimated a growth rate of 8% in yrs 1-5 and 6% in yrs 6-10, discount rate of 10% and terminal value of 20. The growth rates are estimated because of the industry growth projections and Bookings position in the market. Also the 5-year previous growth rates for Booking was 8%, which was the lowest compared to my 1-3-7 and 9 years growth rates so I went with that. 8% is a lower growth rate than the industry growth projections and I wanted to be conservative, especially since the FCF in the current year is at record highs. I always like putting a lower growth rate in the latter half (6%) because it is a lot harder to estimate. The discount rate is high, however, my style has always been to make fewer bets for higher returns and I am happy being patient until those opportunities arrive. This gave me an intrinsic value of $4,296. I try and go a bit further to see if I can get a discount to intrinsic value.

2555,Replacing SP500 ETF exposure with options (or similar),4,1abfj93,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1abfj93/replacing_sp500_etf_exposure_with_options_or/,10,"Hi.  UK-based investor here.

I need to sell a significant chunk of of my investment portfolio (SP500 tracking ETFs; ticker: VUSA) to fund the cash purchase of a house. Let's say ¬£100K for easy numbers.  My concern is that I will be (partially) out of the market for 6-12 months, so I could miss out on stock market upside.  

I want to avoid a margin loan in case the lender changes the terms on which shares/ETFs are acceptable as collateral.  And I can't seem to borrow/re-mortgage sufficient money quickly enough to finance the house purchase.  So I'm considering selling the shares and re-gaining that lost market exposure by buying call options.

I can't be the first person to do this.  Does anyone have any recommended reading/links?  I'm interested in owning the upside if the market rises significantly e.g. >10%.  My first though is to buy long dated out of the money calls, because the calls should be fairly cheap to get  significant exposure. Of course I appreciate they are likely to expire worthless.  In the meantime i will use the capital for the house purchase.

Comments and suggested reading would be most welcome. If there is an alternative strategy then I'm all ears.

Thanks!

2557,Dollar cost averaging strategy for current investments.,0,1abe8s2,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1abe8s2/dollar_cost_averaging_strategy_for_current/,4,"Say you had ten shares, each with various levels of profit, how would you dollar cost average into it?

Say for theories sake,  you had a 1000 usd on each share, and you had 100 usd for each DCA.

Would you DCA into the most profitable share, the least profitable, something in the middle, or just split it and throw 10 usd at each?

Share 1: 173%

Share 2: 68%

Share 3: 57%

Share 4: 55%

Share 5: 46%

Share 6: 23%

Share 7: 18%

Share 8: 2%

Share 9: -4%

Share 10: -37%

If you DCA into the most profitable, you would obviously be increasing your investment into a company that is doing well, but then if it dropped, share 2 could take over as your DCA. The negative though is that if the company is at an ATH it could drop drastically.

If you DCA into the least, it would reduce your loss percentage, and if the company was at it's lowest, the profits could be large. The risk though is if it's a bad investment and you could lose more.

DCA into a share in the middle or 10usd on each I suppose is a safer strategy.

I'm in a bit of a conundrum with my NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation) investment and could really use some advice.

Currently, I own 50 shares of NVDA valued at around $30,000, purchased back in 2017 at $34 per share, with a cost basis of $1,700. This stock has seen unbelievable growth since then of over 1600% and now constitutes 45% of my non-taxable investment account and roughly 20% of all my investment accounts, excluding my home.

Last year, I sold about $5000 worth of NVDA to diversify, but I'm torn about what to do next. On one hand, the stock has been on a tear, and their future looks extremely promising with AI advancements and the huge demand for chips going forward. However, I'm aware of the need to diversify, as well as the risk of the stock taking a massive downturn and significantly hurting my net worth. There are also tax considerations if I sell, since I'll be on the hook for some significant capital gains tax. 

For some context, I'm a married man with two kids, a house with $200k in equity and a $200k mortgage. I have around $80k in IRA accounts and $65k in taxable brokerage accounts amd some cash on hand for emergency fund etc. Little debt otherwise. 

Any advice on whether to sell and diversify, ways to mitigate risks, or hedging strategies would be greatly appreciated. How should I navigate this situation, considering the potential tax bill, its outsized share of my portfolio and the promising future for NVDA? Thanks in advance for your insights!",2024-01-26,0

2567,One common mistake of a novice trader,0,19fgbu1,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/19fgbu1/one_common_mistake_of_a_novice_trader/,4,"Let's imagine the mindset of beginners. Beginners want to earn quickly, a lot and with minimal effort. And most likely, we know from our experience, they will be quite fearful. So they will choose those instruments that are well-known and have a good reputation. These will probably be stocks of companies such as Google, Meta, Amazon, Apple.

**How will beginners add companies to their portfolio?**  
Let's specify that the stocks of these companies are not cheap and cost 100-300 dollars. Of course beginners want to fill their portfolio on enthusiasm right now. This means our trader will go to the stock exchange and simply buy them.  
**What is wrong with that?**  
The point is that you should buy shares of even the seemingly coolest and most famous companies not at any moment of time when you want to, but look at whether it is a good time to enter a position.  
**What does good or bad timing mean?**  
In investing for 10-15 years the concepts of good and bad time lose their relevance. Because for such a long period of time stocks can fall and rise 100 times.  But if we speak about from 1 to 6 months trading, it is very important to choose the right moment. Because you need to earn money rather quickly and you want to earn more, of course.  
For the sake of simplicity let's consider 2 companies: META and AAPL.   
Both of them have a beautiful growing chart for the last year of trading, but you should not buy both companies now, if you take them for a short term.  
The fact is that META and AAPL stocks are at their all-time highs right now. They have rallied strongly over the past couple months and there will soon be a period when the price will be corrected. Since there is no one chart in the market that is a forever rising straight line. There will always come moments of correction. And if you buy their stocks now, you are very likely to buy at the most expensive price in recent times.  
That's why it's important to learn how to analyze charts and choose the moments to buy or sell smartly.",2024-01-25,0

I am sure this topic has been discussed plenty of times. I googled the topic quite much but still did not get a clear answer. 

Wash sale rule states: ""A wash sale occurs when an investor sells a security at a loss and then purchases the same or a substantially similar security within 30 days, before or after the transaction.""

I totally get that we cannot buy it within 30 days after the transaction, but I am not clear about the situation when we buy it within 30 days before the transaction. Does this mean if I buy a new stock, and then sell it after three days with a loss, I CANNOT claim a capitial loss since I buy it ""within 30 days"" prior to the transaction (the sale)? I try to use the following hypothetical scenarios (using very popular VTI and VOO as examples) to understand this problem.

Scenario 1:

I bought $10K worth of VTI on Monday, and unfortunately market crashed, and I sold all shares on Thursday with a value of $9K, and then bought VOO with the money and held it for long term. Can I claim a capital loss of $1K?

Scenario 2a:

I bought $10K worth of VTI on Monday, and then market crashed. In order to decrease my average cost, I then bought another $10K worth of VTI on Thursday. But the market was still trending down.  I sold all shares the next Tuesday with a total worth of $17K. I then bought VOO with this $17K, and held it for long term. Can I claim a capital loss of $3K?

Scenario 2b:

I bought $10K worth of VTI on Monday, and then market crashed. In order to decrease my average cost, I then bought another $10K worth of VTI on Thursday. But the market was still trending down.  On Tuesday of the next week, I sold the shares I bought on Monday, with a total value of $8K, but kept the shares I bought on Thursday. I then bought VOO with this $8K, and then held it for long term. Can I claim a capital loss of $2K?

In 1997 one of the things which contributed to the crisis was capital flight as concerns grew over the stability of the currencies in Asia. Today the something similar is happening, [Capital is leaving China at the fastest pace in more than 8 years](https://archive.ph/Ipwgn).

Obviously this is not 1997 so events from those days will not translate directly to today but looking back can often lead to insights about what the future might hold.

Im trying to make sure i understand these assets right in order to be able to do that. What i think i want is a long maturity bond since i dont expect an economic downturn soon. I dont plan on holding this asset to maturity and simply want to sell it at a profit in a future poor economic market. 

So thats where im looking to understand more. 

From my current understanding a low coupon bond would perform better in this poor market scenario that i am trying to hedge against. The market at that hypothetical time would have low interest rates and poor stock performance which would increase the value of my bond. Whereas a bond with a high coupon rate wont be as valuable since that coupon is reinvested in a low interest market. However im worried that a long maturity zero coupon bond might be hard to sell since it wont be attractive to anyone looking for passive income. Is this a valid concern?

Does this mean that a long maturity treasury zero coupon bond would be the best option for what im looking for?

I also have some questions about the tax implications of the treasury zero. I know that for zero coupon bonds you still get taxed on phantom interest. But since its a treasury zero im not sure if it is tax exempt.

Does anyone know the answers to some of these questions?

2585,Beware of Money Managers who Talk Like This,117,19f2t0v,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/19f2t0v/beware_of_money_managers_who_talk_like_this/,88,"I came across an interesting thread where a money manager was describing the strategy of the ETF that they manage, an investment solution they offer through their wealth management practice.  


He illustrated that their clients are invested in their ETF, **$HF** \- an ETF he runs through their practice, DGA Advisors.  


In his words:

>  
*I'm a global macro-manager.*  
*One of the ways we reduce unsystematic risk in our absolute return portfolios ($HF) is to utilize macro diversification. This starting point aligns with your initial thoughts on positioning to reduce market timing and individual security selection.*  
*As an active manager, I* ***manage a model-driven systematic hedging overlay to the core global macro portfolio that doesn't approach active management from a perspective of market timing but from a framework of gradient risk exposure.***

Notice the buzz words **""Model Driven Systematic Hedging Overlay"" and "" Macro Diversification""**  


Anyway - since the fellow linked his name and his practice I couldn't help myself but to check out $HF, this so called Model Driven Systematic Hedging Overlay Strategy.  


Quick summary of $HF - this is a ""long-short"" portfolio.:

  
It has 8 holdings, ALL INDEX Funds. They are VTI + VT + SPYV +SPYG + SPY + SH +QQQ +DIA.  
Roughly 30% is allocated towards $SH which is ProShares Ultrashort S&P.  
The remainder is long equities, but across major index funds VTI, VT, SPYV, SPYG, SPY, QQQ, DIA.  
**Oh - and the expense ratio is 1.53%.**  


This ETF is basically a closet index fund with unusual overlap (SPY + SPVV+SPYG??) with a 30% short position.  
""Model Driven Systematic Hedging Overlay"" .... yikes.

Background:
Both of my parents receive a pension as well as social security, which essentially sets them for life. They also have free hospitalization for life as well. Short of needing to go to a care facility, they should not need to touch any of their savings. 

But here's the problem - my parents have never invested a single dollar their entire life. They always just assumed the only thing you can buy is stocks and it was too risky and you could ""lose it all"". Ok, I get that, but only recently are they coming around to believing me about index funds and other relatively lower-ish risk investments.  

So, fast forward to where we are now. We are in the process of downsizing them to an apartment closer to where we are to better look after them and get them out from maintaining a home, etc.
When it's all said and done between current savings, home sold, moved into new place and furnishings purchased,  etc they will have upwards of $1M just sitting in a bank account. Why? Because that's just what you always did. 

Anyway, seems crazy to me. 

I am hoping to receive some advice and ideas for me to approach them with in order to help the money grow atleast a little over the next 10 to 15 years. Low-ish risk funds, bonds, other kinds of funds? Their goal is to leave money for the kids and grandkids.
They won't need to touch this except for extreme emergency as their pensions cover all living expenses +. 

No, they will not consider seeing a financial adviser. But, if I can gather up some ideas and my brother and I research, we can present them with a plan. He and I both actively manage our own funds thru Vanguard so we would do the same for them. Just some thoughts/ideas for that amount of money for retirement-aged people.

My parents aren't really a help so I was hoping I could get some advice here.

I make about $60,000 a year and my wife makes $40,000 so our combined income is about $100,000. We live our lives really low cost and over the last 4 years have saved up about $95,000.

Right now that money is just sitting in a regular low interest savings account. I feel like I should do something with this money. I was looking at IRA's and saw that Traditional IRA's can lower your taxable income. In looking at the tax brackets for 2023, it looks like at around $89,000 for a married couple the tax bracket goes from 22% to 12% which is a huge jump.

So If I'm understanding this correctly, if we were to invest say $11,000 in a traditional IRA (Say about $1000 a month) we would then get 10% more money back in our tax returns?

I'm curious if that's how it works and how easy is it to accidently lose it? Like if I get a bonus from work or a raise, or my wife who is a teacher picks up an extra job in the summer?

Particularly in certain areas of the internet like 'local' where currently if you search for best x in city for 98% of terms you just get fed whatever Yelp, TripAdvisor, or YellowPages list has the best keyword match in their title regardless of how old or relevant the actual content is.

5 to 10 years ago those results were filled with local newspapers, bloggers, tv stations, travel bloggers, and other small niche sites that actually had good boots on the ground info. Today they are just outdated lists that were often inaccurate from the start. 

Don't believe me? Google 'best craft stores in city' or 'best art supply stores in city' and replace the word city with any of the 10 through 200 biggest cities in the US.... I'll bet dollars to donuts you find those 3 sites I just mentioned and little else in the top 5.

I know Google has all kinds of things going on with their company, I know the old search is dying (if not already dead) and AI results are coming, but at the end of the day search is Google's brand whether they want to admit it or not and for the last 3 or 4 years they have done nothing but go downhill in this regard.

2615,The Buy-Back Delusion - How Accounting Deludes Investors,23,19egx14,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/19egx14/the_buyback_delusion_how_accounting_deludes/,30,"THE belief that share buy-backs are a universally good thing seems hard to shake, even though there was a time when they were seen as a sign of the lack of imagination in a company's management. But an excellent paper from Terry Smith, who made his fortune in the city as a broker but who was once an analyst who wrote a hard-hitting book called Accounting for Growth, puts buy-backs in their proper perspective.

If two identical companies decide to return cash to shareholders, one via a buy-back and the other via a dividend, the earnings per share of the first group (but not the latter) will rise. This will create the impression that the first group has added value. But the return on equity of both groups will be unchanged! This can lead to potentially confusing outcomes.

Mr Smith suggests the example of Fred Futile, the CEO of Stagnant Inc. He is awarded a 10-year option over the company's stock at the current price of $100 per share. There are initially 100m shares in issue and annual earnings are $1 billion. So he cancels the dividend and uses all the earnings (which remain flat throughout the 10 years) to buy back shares; earnings per share rise and the p.e remains the same. By the end of the 10-year period, the eps will have more than doubled from $10 tr $25.8 and the share price will have risen to $25 earning Fred Futile $158m for himself. But the company isn't really more valuable, it's just more geared.

By the end of the 10-year period, the eps will have more than doubled from $10 to $25.8 and the share price will have risen to $258, earning Fred Futile $158m for himself. But the company isn't really more valuable, it's just more geared*.

If you are not convinced by that example, here is another one. Smith uses the real life example of Pepsi which bought back almost $5 billion of its shares in 2008. This strategy enhanced its eps (albeit in the sense of lessening an eps fall). But what would have happened had Pepsi used the same money to buy shares in Coke, which had a similar p/e ratio to Pepsi? Then the accounting treatment would have changed; instead of reducing the number of shares in issue, the investments on Pepsi's balance sheet would have grown. The eps would not have been bolstered by this approach; more significantly, the return on equity would have fallen.

That is because Pepsi earned a return on equity of 34%. Buying shares in Coke (or itself) on a p/e of around 20 is, in effect, generating a return of just 5% (the earnings yield is the inverse of the p/e). In short, such a purchase destroys value.

Perhaps this is more obvious when one considers a common reason for buy-backs; to mop-up the shares created by option issuance. Executives wouldn't be exercising their options unless they were going to make a profit. So companies are selling shares to executives at a low price and buying them back at a higher one.

This buy high, sell low policy is symbolic of the buy-back era. run a graph (as Smith does) of the S&P 500 against buy-back activity and you will see that activity goes up and down with the market. Executives are not bargain-hunters, except on their own account.

But isn't there evidence that companies that experience buy-backs outperform the market? Yes there is, but Smith has a useful caveat. This outperformance is concentrated in the value stocks, those with the lowest price-to-book value. if the company can buy its shares back below book value, then that is indeed a good deal.

Share buy-backs should only be used if the stock is trading at below its economic value and the repurchase represents the best use of cash availableYou cannot create value by buying back overvalued sharesCompanies should be required to justify the price and returns on repurchases as they would on acquisitions or other investmentsShares repurchased should be left on the balance sheet as an asset and equity accounted.

The main options that he would like to use is SPY or QQQ, as he believes he has hit a jackpot in options technical analysis, and that those trades would be extremely profitable. However, he doesnt know where to invest through as most of the brokers are either CFD brokers, a non cfd broker would be really useful for him to use.

He would like to avoid Etoro and plus500, and to my knowledge Saxo bank is the best, however due to him just starting off with investing in general, it would be really useful to have a more easier to use platform, or a platform that could easily be accessed everywhere, which wasnt the impression I got while using Saxo bank.

What a f\* value evaporation we went through in the last years. China, with the bad press from the US major media and subsequently Markets realigning with US policy (decoupling) left the stock market in the lows. You have companies like $BABA that IPOed at $68 per share on Sept. 14, 2014, and last week this thing was touching that price. But let's compare BABA business and valuation quickly:  


|In Millions|2014|2023|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenues|52,504 RMB or $8,463|868,687 RMB or $126,491|
|Profits|23,403 RMB or  $3,720 |156,906 RMB or $22,583|
|Share Price|\+/- 119$|\+/- 70$|

When China was friendly to the US eyes, the share price of BABA peaked at $300 and I remember that still it was considered a ""value play"" compared to its peers (FAANG or 7MAG)

China has disappointed the market with news (news from US media, reality is always different) and I beleive not a single news can disspoint investors further other than a very extreme US hollywood-driven wet dream of China invading Taiwan (it won't happen militarily, they follow a different policy with a period of 50 to 100 years planning and execution - as they work on long-term leadership, not 4 years elections circus)

Their economy is still doing better than ours in europe or the US, but they aren't active participants of press releases, conference meeting for the front page of Financial Times or election year where US population take it as a sport match.

* BYD took over TESLA. 
* eCommerce in China and South Asia is BABA/Tencent playground moving trillions
* They were the first to release 5G and subsequently US had to take them down with some drama story on Huawei

China state intervened their high growth sectors and companies bcuz their CEOs thought that they could monetise on Chinese publicly-funded resources and create an oligopoly equivalent to the US where Googles, Amazons dominate the citizens privacy, freedom and life. An order has been implemented where they will still exist, but won't cross lines with their algorithms as happened on our side - we are sorrounded by fake news, extreme division, teenagers suicide rate very high, adults depressed and anxiety, etc...

That story is over - I believe China is set to rally and this is the bottom (you read it here first). Recent news signalling this:

>BEIJING, Jan 24 (Reuters) - China's central bank announced a deep cut to bank reserves on Wednesday, in a move that will inject about $140 billion of cash into the banking system and send a strong signal of support for a fragile economy and plunging stock markets.

I want to short AI stocks, companies that talk about AI in a broad sense but can‚Äôt give us problems they are trying to solve. I think what AI can do is hugely understated but problems AI can solve in immediate future are hugely overstated.

What I am saying is that there needs to be some real world problems and those problems need to be addressable by AI. A well known python coding book starts by saying let‚Äôs automate boring things using python. I ask why is that problem worth tackling. Save time and reduce human errors and save people from misery of repetitive tasks. Ok so that‚Äôs an automation of routine tasks that are discrete and process driven.

I understand that ETFs trade real time vs. end of day NAV, but this is not that important for a buy and hold investor.

I think I understand that mutual funds will drive more capital gains distributions and therefore more taxes (or maybe earlier taxes?), but if I am in an IRA or even in a lower income retirement situation, that doesn't matter? If non-IRA/not tax deferred, is that really a big impact?

I understand that ETFs often have lower expense ratios because of lower active management, but can't I find similar low management, roughly equivalent expense ratios for index ETFs or no load index mutual funds?

It's some basic math but, whatever lol

30m\*$1,200=$36,000,000,000

Roughly divide this figure by current BTC prices (I know that this is flawed and probably underestimates the impact of price on investor behaviour btw), and you have demand for around 700,000 BTC over the course of one year. That works out to about 1900 BTC per day versus the daily 900 BTC mined (in this world everyone HODLs).

Would this double prices for available BTC over the course of the year? Likely more when you take the April halving into account?

These updates are needed for digital signatures that currently protect your keys.

Apple is doing this to protect your iMessage- I think we should have at least that same security for our crypto assets!

Typically, someone will say if quantum can hack your wallet,  everything will be vulnerable.   

And that's right- which is why Apple and Google and Governments and Military and Banks and everyone else are preparing or already implementing solutions.  We are sleeping at the wheel. 

We can't just sit back and say this will be quickly and easily fixed when the time comes.   If crypto isn't prepared like everyone else,  it will be an easy target.  To gain consensus,  build, and  test we likely will need years.   Plus we need to give people time to transition assets to a new set of keys that aren't vulnerable.  I'm not sure what we'll do with old wallets from the Satoshi days.   There is a lot of btc sitting there,  and many have even older encryption that is vulnerable even if they never transacted. 

When we do try to transition, asking users to adopt wallets they don't know will not go well. 

I would like to see top coins implement a cross signing model like Qanplatform has built.  

This will allow users to continue using evm wallets they know and trust.  That will limit disruption and allow us to continue using the ecosystem that's been developed. 

To create wider adoption, cryptocurrency should be leading this effort for secure digital assets.  And it needs to start now.   There are too many advancements in quantum computing and more efficient algos to ignore.

Having a seed unsecured inside your home could be the potential biggest threat of your crypto being stolen in the future. Moving your crypto out of your home is a good way to mitigate these risksMy setup allows my seed info to be stored outside on my property to mitigate any risk of robbery/fire.What I did:

* Use high quality paper and ink to write my seed down
   * Why not stamp metal? I probably will in the future as another redundant backup. However, I'm too lazy to actually stamp out a metal backup.
* EDC container: first step is to roll up the papers and throw it in one of these EDC containers. They're typically used in camping for storing medications. They're watertight, cheap, and rugged.
* Fireproof bag: this is just another layer of security. Bag is rated to 5200¬∞. The bag is also waterproof as well.
* IP rated electrical box: high toss the container and bag setup into an IP rated electrical gang box. Again, waterproof and rugged.
   * I also add a reusable desiccant to control humidity. If you're using paper backups for long term storage, keeping a seal that's not humid is keyHide in a safe place!

This set up is triple waterproof, humidity controlled, and fireproof. All for a very cheap setup that's no bigger than 3‚Äùx5‚Äù.Secure your seed, be happy. Hope this helps give you ideas to cheaply and safely store your seed.Other consideration:

* In the future, I'll toss a metal stamped seed into the fire bag

I've not sold a domain name before, so I was wondering - if anyone's dealt with crypto-related domain names - if anyone would offer any advice or tips on the best way to sell a bitcoin-related domain name to realise the most profit.

And are there things to avoid, or common scams to look out for?

I ran the URL through the valuation tool on GoDaddy and it's coming in at the lower end of things, but still a very useful amount of money to me; it's valued at around $2.5k and I'd rather have that amount in crypto.

I'm also very happy to sell for crypto rather than FIAT, and was wondering if anyone knew of a domain selling space that will allow me to price in crypto?

I'm facing a bit of a predicament and could use some advice. I recently logged into my old Binance account, only to be greeted with a message stating that all services are now shut off for United States clients. The catch? I have just one week to withdraw my funds before my account is permanently locked.

Here's where it gets tricky: My account isn't fully verified. I have about 15 different coins worth about $1.5K, and some, like TRX, don't seem to be acceptable on platforms like Coinbase or Binance.us.

Questions:

1. Will I be able to withdraw my funds without full verification?
2. What's the best, simple, and direct approach to receive these funds, especially for coins like TRX that may not be supported on other platforms?

I'd appreciate any guidance or experiences you can share. Thanks in advance for your help!

This seems like it could be a good risk management strategy. If your hardware wallet is compromised for any reason then you would still have the other half of BTC. 

I know the chance of a hack is slim to none but there are multiple reports of it happening to people on reddit--probably due to user error, of course. However, we can all make mistakes or accidentally expose ourselves to risk despite our best efforts.

\-Too Volatile!

\-Real estate is real, this is digital

\-The government will ban it

\-It's a scam

\-Diversification is key, it should be max 5% of your money

I have sold some of my btc. The key I want to make clear: When you sell, sell for a good reason. You most likely will never buy back at the same price.

I saw nearly every person trade away their crypto. My close friend who bought 3 btc for $2,000 each -long before I was involved-had to sell his. My co-worker (much higher up on the food chain) got exposed to a lot and ""sold the rips"". He can never buy back. His entry position was 7k.

While many people think of when to cash out (and yes, I will cash out for certain lifestyle goals with a portion of my crypto), I think it's key to understand we are entering the final 2 cycles until most people figure out what this is. By this, I mean the big ones -btc, eth specifically.

I think within 5 years the idea of buying eth under 10k and btc under 100k will be viewed as laughable. It will be just as laughable as buying a 2,000 sq foot house in la, Orange County, or San Diego for under 800,000. I remember when houses in these areas crossed 1 mill in 2017 and everyone screamed top, top, top. Those are the same people who paid a minimum of 50% more.

RICO was the intended designed behind DAI.

RICO in comparison to assets like DAI and RAI:

* Rico uses a controller that makes it behave more like an independent central bank currency (rather than a USD peg like Dai, or a wrapped USD perpetual swap like Rai). *Note: This comment is outdated, as the Rai team has updated their controller to be more like the original design.*
* Rico is a multi-collateral system, with an incentive-compatible non-governance mechanism for adding new collateral types

A quick rundown. Those of us in CT over the past 2 years all well know about the terrible event that happened to ""@deleteshitcoin"" ([https://twitter.com/delete\_shitcoin](https://twitter.com/delete_shitcoin)) in Puerto Rico.

He made this tweet on the 28th of October:

>CIA and Mossad and pedo elite are running some kind of sex trafficking entrapment blackmail ring out of Puerto Rico and caribbean islands. They are going to frame me with a laptop planted by my ex gf who was a spy. They will torture me to death.

Then, he mysteriously drowned on the 28th of October.

Before this, he was conceptualizing a new kind of stable token called RICO. It interestingly uses the ERC-2535: Diamonds, Multi-Facet Proxy standard

Are smart contracts used somehow to keep it on par? Is there more to it? Does it happen automatically or do humans or AI intervene? Would prefer an educated answer as opposed to one from somebody who makes some intelligent guesses.

One important difference is of course that a specific country controls it's currency and pegging it to another currency (usually the US dollar). I was reading the different ways a country's government would use to peg it's currency - the simplest being just setting a fixed exchange rate and then a country's government intervening to buy or sell it's own currency to maintain that peg when it becomes necessary.

It‚Äôs due for an update! Despite not being at an ATH, new coins and protocols are created daily, and innovation in the space is growing. What does UTXOs, L2's, and RFC-10 even mean?

Most crypto veterans emphasize Doing Your Own Research (DYOR), but as with most things, it's easier said than done. So here's the updated curated list of useful crypto research tools - 2024 edition.

The list is categorized for **two types of long-term investors: fundamental (Set it and forget it HODLERS) and Data-oriented Investors.**

&#x200B;

# Set it and forget it HODLERS

As a set it and forget it hodler your best friend is fundamental research and crypto news. You also want to avoid the 'noise' of the daily market to make it easier to hold.

&#x200B;

**1 - Messari**

[Sample of the Messari Rankings page which is a great starting point](https://preview.redd.it/wg852jyv7kkc1.png?width=1952&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b230952c71b7571d7c5f05ed9be65a13b3ab1d2)

While [Messari](https://messari.io) may look a bit intimidating at first, it makes crypto research incredibly easy once you're able to navigate the site. They have a crypto profile that shows you things like type (currency, privacy coin, smart-contract platform, etc.), consensus algorithm, inception, and a clear and concise description. They also have links to communities, white papers, codes, and research articles.

It's not something you have to check all the time. It's particularly useful whenever you have to do some deep-dive research. Most features are paid nowadays compared to last time, but for a long term HODLER it is still worth it.¬†

&#x200B;

2 - **Coinstats \[NEW\]**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jig8tce38kkc1.png?width=1244&format=png&auto=webp&s=506ecb93ba32d78d369f657cce81c578abb79ddb

[CoinStats](https://coinstats.app) is an all-in-one crypto tracking app where you can track your¬†portfolio of crypto, DeFi, and NFT assets in one place. You can turn on/off notifications on your portfolio returns, depending on if you dare to see what‚Äôs going on or not. IMO, this is the most easy to use app to track all your stuff.¬†

For the HODLER this is nice because it's all a no-fuss app. You also get access to a bonus suite of tools if you ever decide to take some profits after all!¬†

&#x200B;

**3 - Kraken Intelligence Newsletter**

[Sample of Kraken newsletter, Intelligence, formerly knows as Hash](https://preview.redd.it/lkjak25c8kkc1.png?width=1248&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c694b1d9f92ca72c9dc252fc3cc4e0080b6b131)

Again, as a long-term HODLER, you want to focus on the big news instead of what X billionaire has to say about crypto. You're talking regulations, milestones, and adoption. Kraken has a newsletter that aggregates the most relevant crypto headlines into a quickly readable format. They also have research reports about market recaps and other big events once a month or so.

You can subscribe to them [here](https://www.kraken.com/en-us/subscribe/intelligence). I also subscribe to the OTC report but that's for more technical discussions that may or may not be suited for long-term HODLING.

# 

# Data-oriented Investors

Despite crypto being a very young market, there's a lot to love about crypto market data. In my opinion, the data-oriented aspect of crypto is underrated. Contrary to what some might argue, there are tons of metrics and theories backed by a sufficient number of years, that make the cryptoverse a unique investing environment. For example, in its 14 year lifetime, crypto has been characterized by long-term bull and bear markets,¬†each of them having less ROI and longer runs than the prior cycle.   
This follows the diminishing returns and lengthening cycles theory, respectively. So here's where you can find all the important data-related metrics and resources.

&#x200B;

**1 - AlphaSquared \[NEW\]**

&#x200B;

[AlphaSquared's Risk Model \(Orange\) with Dynamic DCA strategy both in and out](https://preview.redd.it/0udy9hdo8kkc1.png?width=2592&format=png&auto=webp&s=95c1fa5bc3cac87c80872ec8414f5b52d1098187)

[AlphaSquared](https://alphasquared.io) is the king of risk metrics and Dynamic DCA. As a data oriented investor, getting data from literally every corner of the market analyzed by a risk model like this with ready to go DCA strategies paired with it is a gold mine. You can backtest DCA strategies based on their risk metric, forward-test scenarios and get notified of the risk. Bonus is the model for ETH as well, and I hear more are coming.

The risk can be accessed for free with an 8 week delay [here](https://alphasquared.io/), and they have a free DCA Backtester using Risk [here](https://alphasquared.io/bitcoin-dca-calculator/). Other stuff like strategies and notifications are paid, but honestly a steal. It can be hard to find stuff like this with a proven track record, so the performance of this the past 2+ years is very comforting.

&#x200B;

**2 - Glassnode**

&#x200B;

[Glassnode Studio, with a ton of on-chain metrics to dive into](https://preview.redd.it/vub69esx8kkc1.png?width=3824&format=png&auto=webp&s=066522fd7e143854c7eaf160a17654e5986ab720)

This is an on-chain market indicators site, with some free indicators for bitcoin. They have the [Studio](https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=BTC&m=addresses.ActiveCount), a live on-chain data explorer with visualisations of the most fundamental on-chain metrics, Glassnode [workbench](https://studio.glassnode.com/workbench), a comprehensive library of on-chain metrics, and [Insights](https://insights.glassnode.com/), contextualized reports and analyses drawn from on-chain data.

They also have an academy where you can learn how to read all of these metrics and data. Like Kraken Intelligence, they also have a [newsletter](https://insights.glassnode.com/tag/newsletter/) for technical discussions on major cryptocurrencies. Similar to messari, a lot of glassnode stuff is behind a paywall these days, but a ton of valuable things like the workbench is a must to try (it‚Äôs partly free).¬†

&#x200B;

**3 - Lunarcrush \[NEW\]**

&#x200B;

[Lunarcrush workbench, with aggregated data from social platforms](https://preview.redd.it/kax00m639kkc1.png?width=1244&format=png&auto=webp&s=0310a250b4199d9a00f8566b650d6c85600ec2b6)

Last but not the least is [Lunarcrush](https://lunarcrush.com/categories), a social media analytics platform.

An Initial Coin Offering (ICO) represents a fundraising mechanism wherein startups create and offer their unique digital tokens to early investors in exchange for other established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Unlike traditional fundraising methods that require startups to part ways with company equity, ICOs enable them to raise funds while retaining full ownership.

 **The Evolution of ICOs: A Historical Overview**

 The ICO phenomenon originated in 2013 with J.R. Willet's white paper for MasterCoin, later rebranded as Omni Layer. In 2014, seven projects raised $30 million, notably Ethereum securing over $18 million. 2015 saw seven sales totaling $9 million, with Augur leading. The surge came in 2016, with 43 ICOs raising $256 million, including notable projects like Waves and Golem. In 2017, 342 ICOs raised $5.4 billion, fueled by rapid advancements, though some projects faced security issues.

 

## How Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) Function

When a cryptocurrency project decides to raise funds through an ICO, the initial step for project organizers is to define the coin's structure. ICOs can take several structural forms, including:

1.  Static Supply, Static Price: Tokens are sold at a fixed price, with a predetermined funding goal.
2. Static Supply, Dynamic Price: Tokens are sold at a fixed supply, but the price per token varies based on the total funds raised.
3. Dynamic Supply, Static Price: Tokens are sold at a fixed price, but the total supply adjusts based on the funds received.

 **Key Factors to Consider Before Investing in ICOs**

**1. Project Whitepaper:** *This is a document released by projects planning an ICO. It details critical aspects like its goals, funding needs, token distribution, accepted payment methods, and campaign duration. Scrutinize this document thoroughly before deciding to invest.*

**2. Management Team:** *Look into who is behind the project ‚Äî their experience with cryptography and blockchain technology can be indicative of their ability to deliver on their promises.*

**3. Legal Terms and Conditions:** *Review these carefully for any red flags that might indicate potential fraud.*

**4. Escrow Wallet:** *Funds deposited in an escrow wallet are only released to the project once it hits certain milestones. This offers some protection against scams.*

**5. Transparency:** *This is key when evaluating ICO projects. Look for clear goals and straightforward white papers.*

The funds have basically become the new, more refined custodials of Bitcoin. Moving forward I think that it is going to be a tough sale for Cexes like Coinbase or Binance to get folks to start or continue investing into crypto through them.

- list change of price-change per coin, per transaction (almost ever app...)
- distinguishing between selling, transferring and STAKING automatically (none.)

If you only care about profit, which is always proportional to volatility, you will value the most volatile asset. I only care about the tech.

As the first crypto, Bitcoin is the most basic and least technologically advanced of all. There was a lot of room for improvement when it first came out, and a lot of ideas were proposed, but got rejected. Bitcoin has seen some bug fixes, and a bunch of small optimizations, but the core architecture hasn't changed because the devs won't allow it. They want to keep it original.

So developers implemented their ideas in altcoins. A lot of altcoins are trash, pointless memes, scams, and cash grabs, but every legitimate altcoin is inherently superior to Bitcoin. Litecoin, for example, is superior simply because it has a shorter confirmation time, and a memory bound hash function, which is more energy efficient. Anything you can do with Bitcoin you can do better with Litecoin. Today, Monero is the most advanced crypto in the world; superior to Bitcoin by every measure.

Crypto markets may appear to contradict everything I'm saying, but actually they prove my point. Markets are dominated by investors who only care about profit, not tech. Their collective desire to pump and take profit is what makes Bitcoin volatile, which makes it attractive, so they're always dog pilling Bitcoin.

The goal is to create an arcade version of  steam but on chain. This is an opportunity to get in on the ground floor of something special.  Here‚Äôs an overview of the teams vision: 

$AVI - Aviator is a Web gaming project leveraging the low transaction fees on the Base network to remove the barrier to entry for their DeFi gaming platform:
Aviator Arcade‚Ñ¢. The open Web3 platform, Aviator Arcade, allows for the publishing of game contracts directly to the blockchain without the need to pay hosting fees.

The contract structure rewards both Players and Developers with the native arcade token $AVI. This process brings both exposure and funding to smaller developers who lack other avenues to publish their work.

After launching on the Ethereum Blockchain in July of 2023, the team is aiming to spearhead the adoption of the Base Network through their unique bridge contract: SkyBridge‚Ñ¢, that facilitates bridging tokens and NFTs from Ethereum Mainnet to Base.  Notably, it allows users to bypass the usual 7-day withdrawal delay.  This is critical as it will allow access  to the huge pool of funds on Ethereum while offering cheap fast and scalable transactions on Base.  The bridge is currently being audited by Hacken the team that audited Binance and 1inch among others. 

The Aviator token functions both as the native platform token as well as the governance token for the entirety of the project, including the Aviator Treasury, giving control back to the players. 

Aviator's mission is centered around redefining the digital gaming sector by introducing a decentralized gaming platform. We are dedicated to creating a unique gaming ecosystem where game developers and players do not just participate but rather actively shape the Aviator project.
By leveraging the power of our Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) and Aviator Arcade, we provide unprecedented opportunities for community members to influence decisions, game developers of any experience to develop games, and all participants the opportunity to guide the development and future of the platform.  The DAO has already voted to burn 7.5% of the total supply and burns have been completed with more to come at future milestones.  ""The DAO has already voted to burn 7.5% of the total supply and burns have been completed with more to come at future milestones.  Aside from the community voted burns, the arcade itself will burn 1% on all transactions within the arcade, making the token deflationary.

The team here is shooting to have a best in class platform that becomes an industry standard for Indy game designers and players looking for unique gaming experiences.  The tokenomics are deflationary presenting a unique opportunity for holders.  Take a closer look:

It's no secret that the crypto market has historically gone on a bull run soon after the Bitcoin halving date. For those who are anticipating another epic rise, we're entering exciting times. But that doesn't mean it's easy to know when the invest.   


For example, right now: 

**BTC - $51K , ETH - $3K , many notable alts up 50-100% but nowhere near all time highs.** 

I could see a reasonable argument for both buying and selling. 

Buyers would say we are still very early and this is time to load up before the halving date. 

Sellers would say the bull run hasn't started, and we're due for a correction in the next 2 months. 

DCA fam would roll their eyes at both and keep doing what they've always done.

1. First thing that jumped out to me on the Market Caps was Holy Bone! Really nice upward move since last week. POOP and TACO also both had upward trends in the fourth tier action. While GODL and Plunger had fairly significant drops of over 10k each. TACO may have finally cemented the flippening over Plunger.
2. In the top tier DOGE and SHIB both dropped a bit while PEPE ran up some. Those may been moving in the same directions so interesting to see a little break in that action. 
3. I almost forgot but I was pleasantly surprised to see MOONs back in the 13 cent range. Looks like it started pumping yesterday and peaked up to 17 cents around 11:30pm last night (my time). 
4. Among those in the third tier (DONUT, CONE and GONE) we had another shuffling with DONUT and CONE flipping jump barely. And I'll be honest I'm starting to get a bit concerned about GONE, it's been on a down trend for the past month. I know there is good news coming down the pipe line but the hype is (maybe) starting to die down a bit. We'll see if that trend continues in the weeks to come.

&#x200B;

Here are the updated monthly trends. The numbers are tracking percentage change from when I first collected the data and is not a change by month. So steady, continual growth is what I'm looking for here. Comparing the holder numbers for DOGE and Plunger are a good example.

I won't say to much about these numbers, you can look at them for yourselves and draw your own conclusions other than to say those that for those that buy and hold BONE and TACO would have been your best investment so far in the past three months. A little unexpected if I do say so myself!

2721,2024 Crypto Tax Guide for U.S.,40,1ay37v9,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ay37v9/2024_crypto_tax_guide_for_us/,22,"Every year we get many folks coming to us asking the same questions about crypto taxes in the U.S. Here is a breakdown of the most common questions:

Which Crypto Transactions Are Taxable?

* You have to report most crypto transactions as taxable events. This includes more than just cashing out. Using crypto to purchase goods or services, or even trading one cryptocurrency for another, is taxable.
   * The following crypto transactions are subject to capital gains tax:
      * Cashing out (selling crypto for USD/fiat)
      * Converting or swapping crypto
      * Paying for goods and services with crypto
      * Trading crypto for NFTs or vice versa
   * The following cryptocurrency transactions are taxable as ordinary income:
      * Mining or staking
      * Receiving an airdrop
      * Getting paid in crypto
      * Earning interest, yield, or other types of rewards

Do you pay tax when you cash out?

* Yes, cashing out your crypto‚Äîselling it for USD or any other type of government-issued currency‚Äîis taxable. This creates a capital gain.

Is converting taxable?

* Swapping one type of crypto for another (for example, trading ETH for ADA) is a taxable event. The IRS views this as selling the first coin for USD, then using USD to buy the second coin.

Is paying with crypto taxable?

* Yes, using crypto to pay for something is a taxable event that creates a capital gain. This is true whether you‚Äôre buying physical goods, services, NFTs, or anything else.

Taxes on mining?

* Crypto mining is taxable as ordinary income. Typically, the IRS considers mining a business, which means that you can deduct business expenses. 

Staking taxes?

* Yes, there are taxes on staking rewards. Unlike mining, the IRS doesn‚Äôt typically see staking as a business that allows tax write offs. Instead, they typically consider staking rewards as miscellaneous income.

Taxes if you get paid in crypto?

* When you receive payment in cryptocurrency, that‚Äôs taxable as ordinary income. This is true whether you‚Äôre accepting payment for original NFTs, physical goods, services, or anything else. It also applies if your employer pays your salary or bonus in crypto.

Are there taxes on airdrops?

* Airdrops are taxable as ordinary income. The IRS guidance on airdrops only mentions cryptocurrencies (such as BTC and ETH). However, the conservative approach is to treat airdrops of NFTs or utility tokens the same way. 

How about USDC?

* The IRS treats USDC and other stablecoins just like other cryptocurrencies for tax purposes. Trading them or converting them could trigger capital gains tax obligations.

What‚Äôs not taxable? There are some crypto transactions that are tax-free, but you may still need to report them. Non-taxable crypto transactions include:

* Purchasing crypto with USD/fiat
* Transferring crypto between your own wallets and exchanges
* Holding crypto, even if the value increases
* Giving or receiving crypto as a gift (within limits)
* Donating crypto to a qualified nonprofit

Is Buying Crypto a Taxable Event?

* Buying crypto with USD or another government-issued currency is not taxable. No need to report on your tax return if your only activity was buying.

Is Transferring Crypto a Taxable Event?

* Transferring crypto between your own wallets or accounts is typically not taxable. It‚Äôs like moving assets from one pocket to another. Each movement should be tracked to find the crypto cost basis. Be wary of crypto tax software mislabeling self-transfers as taxable transactions.

If My Crypto Has Gone Up in Value, Do I Have to Pay Tax?

* Holding onto crypto that has increased in value is an unrealized gain, which is not taxable unless you have trader tax status.Taxes are due once you sell, trade, swap, or otherwise dispose of the crypto.

Is Sending Crypto Taxable?

* Sending crypto as a gift is typically not taxable unless annual or lifetime limits are exceeded.A crypto gift letter may be required, or a gift tax return filed.Sending crypto from one wallet to another is not taxable. Sending crypto as payment for goods or services is taxable.

Is Donating Crypto Taxable?

* Donating crypto to a qualified nonprofit does not trigger capital gains tax. The donation may be tax deductible, serving as a strategy to avoid crypto capital gains tax.

Do I Have to Report Crypto If I Lost Money?

* Yes, the IRS requires that you report crypto losses along with all other crypto activity. Believe it or not, this can save you a lot of IRS headaches. Cryptocurrency losses can offset gains and reduce your overall tax liability. It‚Äôs crucial to report both gains and losses accurately to ensure you‚Äôre not overpaying taxes.

Do Crypto Exchanges Report to the IRS?

* Yes, many crypto exchanges report certain information to the IRS. When the IRS receives information about your crypto from an exchange, it‚Äôs critical that you report everything correctly. Most exchanges currently use Form 1099-MISC or Form 1099-B. When it comes to crypto, these forms are often not sufficient for filing your taxes accurately.
* Popular crypto exchanges that report to the IRS include: Coinbase, [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com), Binance US, Kraken, Gemini, Bitstamp, Robinhood, and CashApp.

What Happens If I Don‚Äôt Report Crypto on My Taxes?

* If you fail to report your crypto transactions accurately, you can face serious consequences. These include cryptocurrency tax audits, severe financial penalties, and even criminal tax investigations. The IRS has been actively targeting crypto tax evasion for years. Soon, the IRS will start collecting much more information on Form 1099-DA. Report your activities correctly to avoid problems.

I'm here to share some exciting updates from the Cartesi ecosystem, focusing on the impressive progress made by Sunodo, a prominent contributor within the Cartesi community.

&#x200B;

Sunodo has been diligently working on developing open-source tools aimed at simplifying the process of creating and deploying Cartesi decentralized applications (dApps). They firmly believe that facilitating easier dApp deployment is crucial for boosting Cartesi's adoption and advancing the ecosystem's growth.

&#x200B;

Their main offering, previously known as Sunodo CLI (Command Line Interface), is almost ready to launch. This open-source platform aims to streamline the deployment of Cartesi dApps, making it as smooth as similar processes in other ecosystems, all thanks to the Cartesi Virtual Machine.

&#x200B;

Here's the exciting part: As the launch date approaches, Sunodo recognizes that Sunodo CLI is not just a tool‚Äîit's an integral part of Cartesi's infrastructure. With approval from the Cartesi Foundation, Sunodo is rebranding Sunodo CLI as Cartesi CLI and integrating it with other core ecosystem products like Cartesi Rollups and Cartesi Compute.

&#x200B;

What's even more thrilling is that Cartesi CLI will be managed and maintained by the broader Cartesi community, following the ecosystem's governance frameworks. However, Sunodo will continue to play a significant role in this transition.

&#x200B;

But wait, there's more! In addition to Cartesi CLI, Sunodo is preparing to offer essential services to the ecosystem as the primary professional Cartesi validator. They will provide node-running services for developers and users who prefer not to run their own validator nodes.

&#x200B;

As a validator service, Sunodo is making two major commitments to the ecosystem: adopting CTSI as the payment currency for Sunodo validation services and dedicating a portion of their validator revenue back to the ecosystem (specifics to be determined!).

&#x200B;

Exciting times lie ahead! And the excitement doesn't end there. There's a proposal in progress at the Cartesi Vision Forum outlining plans for a community-governed Cartesi Validator Marketplace. Imagine CTSI as the payment currency alongside an innovative revenue-sharing model.

&#x200B;

Looks like there's a lot to anticipate! It would be great to hear the community's thoughts on this technical concept.",2024-02-23,0

This may be obvious as it is quite simple but anyways. 

Once the bullrun starts as it has now just move away from the space and look at crypto news only once every few days. Do not read the daily where everyone is posting about their 100 different projects going up 200% everyday. Dont read most crypto subreddits/telegrams as it will be the same. Just look at the charts of your own projects/other projects you are interested in to make a calculated decision on what you think is the next move for you.

I know that you might think that you will missout on profits but the buying time is kind of over anyway as most of the projects have pumped already so all you could achieve is one of 2 things:

1. Just trade everything into the NEW BIG THING that everyone is shilling everyday or even a couple of times a day and lose massive amounts of money from gas fees.

2. Not swap your projects and feel bad about your project going up only 50% as opposed to 200%.

Yes you could profit but the chance is very slim and really not worth it. (Cue the ""So you are telling me there is a chance"" memes)

Closing statement: Just believe in your projects and stay away from crypto news/subreddits/telegrams.


DISCLAIMER: 
I am not saying that you should not stay updated/look out for new projects at all. Im saying that now is not the propper time for this and doing so will just make you feel bad. You should be looking at buying/staying on top of the market in a bear market not in a bull one. Just hold your coins and believe that you made good choices.",2024-02-23,0

I‚Äôve read a bit about uniswap, and at first I thought that that was just a normal exchange that I could trade any coin I wanted on it.

Sam and his crew discovered it was going on, and actually benefitted from it by beating Binance's bots at their own game, and actually profited from it... until of course Binance found out about it and CZ shut them down.

My theory is, that the United States cucked CZ into giving up his beloved baby Binance, then cucked him into coming to The States to stand in front of the powers that be, and is being cucked into staying until April until after they get done with Sam in March for his final trial, because I believe along with all the money John Ray has found so far to make all of the FTX rug pulled victims whole again, Sam has been spilling the beans on everything CZ has ever done illegally, including who and when he gave money to known terrorists, along with a long list of other obvious financial crimes.

I believe, Sam believes, with all this brought to the table, his sentence will be reduced to community service, and be freed for cooperating with the powers that be by helping them put CZ away instead. Then Sam can go find that $450 million dollars he disappeared right after the collapse of FTX, and live happily ever after with his little bean bag and floppy socks.

Hell, he may even pull an Adam Neumann and start up a new exchange, because why the hell not? Softbank and Andreessen Horowitz will spot him a cool billion to do so, so he'll be alright.

2755,PoW vs PoS,0,1awql8t,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1awql8t/pow_vs_pos/,12,"Let's discuss one of the many downsides of proof-of-stake (PoS). There are several popular altcoins whose consensus mechanism on their base layer is PoS touting how little energy their network uses to operate. One of the many problems with PoS on the base layer is the circular reference of value. You stake your tokens that cost nothing to produce except other tokens as security collateral but how do you get the initial tokens? You have to buy them from someone who already has them: you need to be invited and therefore need permission.

PoS is backed by reputation only. All of these networks were created with substantial pre-mine which means they were awarded a large percentage of the outstanding tokens for almost no cost (including the popular one that started as PoW and later rug-pulled their miners).

Now let's examine proof-of-work (PoW). In a PoW network as long as you can provide valid proof of work you can participate in the protocol: you don't need to be invited and therefore don't need permission! You can't be locked out by the protocol. Of course you can still be economically priced out of the equipment but it's not enforced in code like in PoS.

Let's take this a step further. If you keep PoW at the base layer like in Bitcoin, your network remains open and permissionless and secured by physical collateral. If miners try something stupid the [network can reject their work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncPyMUfNyVM). From there, if you really wanted, you can build a second layer network with proof-of-stake of the layer one tokens (ie. Bitcoin). You can stake something that has a defined exchange rate for physical resources and therefore has actual value. Every second miners around the world are trading their time and energy for Bitcoin block rewards and fees. You could reimplement the layer one PoS networks on top of Bitcoin and the network would be more secure than one backed by reputation only. This is why PoS on the base layer isn't viable long term.

For what it's worth the lightning network is like a primitive form of proof of stake since you lock up your bitcoin in a multisig contract as collateral and if you're a routing node you can collect fees (ie. ""yield"") from that collateral. Not quite the same thing of course but there's similarity.",2024-02-21,0

Mass institutional adoption and market regulation. These are things crypto has only been able to dream of so far, but now, and very soon, they will become the cornerstones of being successful in this market.

Most blockchains can‚Äôt handle either of these key upcoming market characteristics. 

For institutions to adopt and use blockchains, the price per transaction needs to be low, the transactions per second needs to be high and the transaction needs to be instantly final. The institution needs to be sure that the transaction is secure and the chain needs to be reliable- no downtime.

The ONLY chain that offers all of these points is Algorand. 

Imagine you are a bank completing millions of transactions between accounts each day. You can‚Äôt use ETH- too slow and expensive. If you use a L2 they‚Äôre also currently too slow and expensive and you also need to trust an additional third party! (Crap)

If you use Cardano or XRP they‚Äôre slow and risk falling over once network volume increases. If you use SOL or HBAR- they both have histories of breaking down (particularly SOL which has an ungodly amount of failed transactions) so you might not be able to do any transactions at all when they‚Äôre out of action and none of these chains give you instant finality with no forking. So you could have transactions being rolled back after they‚Äôve shown as complete! Imagine that in a bank!

Regulation wise, all of these projects have left themselves open to SEC action too! All with direct sales into the US market. ALGO didn‚Äôt! 

Algorand based themselves in Singapore and did KYC to specifically rule out the possibility of selling direct into the US market. Sure Gensler has mentioned them in a case against someone else but he knows he can‚Äôt sue directly as they‚Äôre not based in his jurisdiction. 

So Algorand ticks all boxes when it comes to regulation and mass adoption by institutions.

Couple that with the planned upcoming changes- incentivised node operation, so you will in effect be able to mine ALGO like you can with bitcoin, and the move to the Python programming language. The most used programming language in the world by a very long way! High school kids will be able to program on Algo! With a lot of assistance from Algo kit 2.0 and AI. Huge moves coming in Q1 this year! Game changing for the entire crypto space. 

Silvio Micali is and always will be the OG of the crypto industry.

I have a portfolio made of BTC, ETH and ADA. My plan had always been to continue accumulating and then start exiting around the run after the 2028 halving (if it plays out that way) as I‚Äôll be turning 50 that year and it should help support me retiring early on top of other investments etc.

However, I need to pick up a new car, probably around July this year.

50% of my ETH at current prices would buy the car outright, so no debt and no interest, and I could then go back to re-accumulating that ETH over the next couple of years. This likely means I won‚Äôt make the same margin on part of my ETH stack as I don‚Äôt expect to see the prices I was lucky enough to accumulate at initially, but as my ETH is currently 102% up when aggregated, some of that would balance out against the realised profit from using it on the car.

My biggest concern is that I‚Äôm expecting the next bull market to really run from Q4 2024 until Q4 2025 (just my opinion, not claiming to be an oracle!) so I know I‚Äôd be cashing out at a less than ideal time.

I don‚Äôt like the idea of financing the car and having to pay a load of interest when I could be spending that money reinvesting in my portfolio, but I‚Äôm not clever enough to know whether the potential gains from holding my ETH would perform better than the interest payments on the car. 

I could afford to make the monthly car payments if finance is the better option, but quality of life is obviously better if there is no monthly payment to be made, and paying down a car would reduce my monthly DCA by about 50% and would be less flexible (I can always reduce my DCA for a month if things come up, whereas a car payment is going to be set in stone) So, I‚Äôm interested to see what thoughts people have. 

Thanks for any insight you guys can provide.

I wanted to start a discussion today about prediction markets and the potential for blockchain technology to revolutionize this space. I have made another attempt in the past but I noticed people did not fully understand what I was asking so here is my better attempt.

Prediction markets have long been recognized as powerful tools for aggregating information and making accurate forecasts about future events. Whether it's predicting election outcomes, sports results, or financial trends, the collective wisdom of participants can provide valuable insights.

**Challenges with Traditional Markets:** However, traditional prediction markets often suffer from centralization, with intermediaries like bookies or centralized platforms taking a large share of the profits. This not only limits access to prediction markets but also introduces issues of trust, transparency, and fairness.

**Enter Blockchain Technology:** Blockchain technology offers a solution to these challenges by enabling decentralized prediction markets. By leveraging blockchain, we can create peer-to-peer prediction protocols that empower users to create, participate in, and validate markets directly, without the need for intermediaries.

**Benefits of Decentralization:** Decentralized prediction markets offer several key benefits:

* **Transparency:** All transactions and market outcomes are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and accountability.
* **Fairness:** With no centralized authority controlling the market, participants can trust that outcomes are determined fairly and impartially.
* **Accessibility:** Decentralized prediction markets are accessible to anyone with an internet connection, removing barriers to entry and democratizing access to forecasting.

**Potential Risks of Decentralized Prediction Markets:** It's important to acknowledge that while decentralized prediction markets hold promise, they also come with potential risks. Some of these risks include:

* **Regulatory Uncertainty:** Decentralized prediction markets may face regulatory challenges in certain jurisdictions, which could impact their legality and operation.
* **Manipulation:** As with any market, there's a risk of manipulation by bad actors seeking to influence outcomes for their own gain.
* **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities:** Smart contracts powering decentralized prediction markets are not immune to bugs or vulnerabilities, which could lead to unintended consequences or security breaches.

I'm interested to hear your thoughts on prediction markets and the role of blockchain technology in decentralizing this space. Do you see value in decentralized prediction protocols? What are your concerns or questions about this approach? Let's discuss!",2024-02-22,0

Let's say you purchased a token [MemeCoin] for $10 - for a while everything was going well.

One day you wake up and the community is torn to pieces, you have $0.01 and the creators are nowhere to be seen.

Clearly a scam or something suspicious about that.

Now if you were to look at the token on Coinmarket Cap or similar you would see that there is still a couple million dollars of value sitting in this token but the holders will never sell because $0.01 is worthless to me and not worth the effort and gas gees.

So my question is - let's say there is about 5 million dollars in this token, does it just dissappear from existence, sitting in a void?

I understand that the price will reduce as people sell and that not everyone can break-even, I know there will be winners and losers but if the token is dead, no trading is happening there is surely a ton of money lying around that will never go anywhere.

Update: Thank you for all the replies, I was a little confused but it make sense now. The market just facilitates transactions and is not a store of value but rather the perception of value.

I think very positive price action will accompany this upgrade, but I don't have a crystal ball.

So, the new big thing on the Fantom platform is the Sonic upgrade, which is not yet live on the main net.  Testing began back in October, and we've heard nothing but positive reports.  Projected deployment on the main net is set for 'spring 2024'; I've also seen April tossed around in the Discord as a probable month for main net launch.

There are three really exciting aspects of this upgrade: transaction speed (including EVM transactions), time to finality, and reduction of technical overhead to run a validator.  The amount of FTM needed to run a validator also recently decreased to 50,000 from 500,000, but that was done through the governance mechanism and is not a part of the Sonic upgrade.

It also describes how the Carmen database upgrade (part of Sonic) will significantly reduce validator technical overhead.

I have enough common sense to not throw money at this, but I'm really curious to understand what's actually going on here, and what the reason for doing something like this is?

I find this impossible to believe the individual behind an operation like this is actually making off with $1.5B - so where does this figure come from, and how are they confusing Dexscreener in this way?

Is this money laundering? Some kind of tax scheme? What's the actual reason for even doing this? I'm so confused given that it seems to be botted and not actually taking anyone's money.

Hey community,

With LocalBitcoins closing down, it got me thinking about the challenges and potential of peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto exchanges. I once toyed with creating a similar platform but hit roadblocks like trader authenticity, legal hurdles, and the viability of face-to-face (F2F) trades.

Is there still a place for face-to-face cryptocurrency transactions in today‚Äôs digital age?

How can a platform balance the need for user privacy and security while adhering to increasingly stringent regulatory requirements?

What lessons can we learn from LocalBitcoins‚Äô journey for future crypto exchanges?

2780,"Monero being a better store of value than fiat while also being a good (cheap, fungible) medium of exchange is more important than competing with BTC on that title. Change my mind.",3,1aw7vv2,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1aw7vv2/monero_being_a_better_store_of_value_than_fiat/,3,"#Fiat is a store of value (despite being bad at it)

Also many Gold bugs and Bitcoin maxis have their own narratives, fiat currency in all of its forms and most prominently with USD is still the de facto store of value for most people around the world despite it's insufficient characteristics as money - mainly due to inflation. But it doesn't need to be perfect. It just needs to be better on average than other competing alternatives. So easy access, every day use (100% adoption) and UX seem to favor fiat over other alternatives.


#Fiat is the medium of exchange
So far most of the world's transactions 99.9%+ take place in fiat currencies. And that will probably stay the same way for the foreseeable future. Which means cryptocurrencies or rather cryptoassets have been adopted partly as a speculative investment, partly as ""store of value"" -  against inflating fiat currencies.

After 15 years we still have not created a system that is able to compete with fiat mainstream adoption. Bitcoin with its limited supply is mainly competing with Gold. Other projects are trying to invent new stuff but are often money grabs, pump and dumps or outright scams. 

#So what are the properties needed for a good cryptocurrency then?

While BTC chose the route of becoming a store of value before becoming a mediocre? medium of exchange Monero went the other route. It's designed to be first a medium of exchange with properties that position itself between BTC and fiat currencies as a store of value.

What is special about Monero:

* supply is currently smaller than BTC's and this will remain so until 2040 (https://moneroj.net/coins/)
* inflation currently sits at 0.8% which is roughly half of BTC and Gold's inflation rate
* transactions are fungible like cash
* dynamic blocksizes guarantee low fee transactions and throughput

Monero is likely the only cryptocurrency that can eat into the market share of fiat currencies because it's mcuh better than fiat at being astore of value and medm of exchange and not because it is an arguable worse store of value than BTC, because supply is limited by time and not by a fixed number.",2024-02-21,0

2783,Don't make the same mistake as me and stake your crypto on third party sites.,104,1awowkq,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1awowkq/dont_make_the_same_mistake_as_me_and_stake_your/,82,"I am in crypto since 2017 but that didn't save me from losing more money than I can stomach. in 2021, after trading crypto for years, taking risky steps and buying shitcoins for shot term gains, I finally converted them all to BTC ETH and LINK. I was happy with my amount of crypto and ready let it sit for years. But because I am greedy I wanted to gain some interest on it too, but I didn't trust Binance or other CEX's so was looking for a DEX. After researching Uniswap, Aave, Maker and others I found Bancor, which offered good APY and I ended up staking 90% of my crypto on there.

Idk if you are familiar with what happend to Bancor. I feel so stupid for trusting them but they were promising 100% Impermanent loss protection and were deemed as a blue chip defi by a large part of the crypto community, they actually build the first AMM and it was the go-to place to stake LINK. In my eyes they were as legit as it gets. I made some money staking my TKN's there but in summer 2022 whales where withdrawing so much that the 100% Impermanent loss protection which was compensated by printing BNT caused a huge BNT inflation, causing them to stop the ILP and forcing us to face impermanent losses worse than on other platforms, because they are socialized amongst all stakers. 

Despite this clear design flaw causing stakers facing 60%+ impermanent loss on ETH and BTC the Bancor foundation which raised $130M USD in the biggest ICO in crypto history refused to even comment on this situation let alone reimburse anyone, even tho the deficit was only about 1/5 of their ICO money. A few months later a disgruntled investor showed up at their office in Switzerland and threated them, only after that they made a statement saying they won't bail anyone out but they will fund development for 10 years to come. 1.5 years later the deficit is worse than it ever has been. The Bancor team is earning the ICO money while pretending to still try to alleviate the deficit but they actually just there to keep the show running and drain the ICO money. Team members who were against that and actually wanted to continue building got ousted. Recently they even said in the Telegram that they refuse to work on Bancor as long as the SEC lawsuit against Solana isn't settled and use that as an excuse to fully stop the marketing and development of the token, let alone even discuss potential features for it.

Almost all the unhappy people in the telegram got banned by now, just today someone got banned for replying to Mark Richardson, a guy who got put in charge by the foundation to solve this situation and failed miserably so far. Mark asked if the community thinks he should step down just to ban everyone who said yes. It is a shame what this project has turned into and it made me realize that no matter what they promise, no matter their references in the space, no matter if doxxed or not, if they want to scam you, they will find a way. I will take the haircut soon and try to work up my way from there again, I will be fine but it really sucks to lose 60% of your crypto this way. 

TLDR: Scammers from Bancor promised big and delivered low, causing me to to lose 60% of my crypto despite them promising 100% Protection. They were respected in the crypto space, fully doxxed, and still made me lose my money with their shitty DEX.",2024-02-21,0

There's no face to it. The founders created it and walked away. It's like an elegant clock set into motion that continues to tick. There's no promise of some complex protocol to come 3, 5, or 10 years down the road. It does what it's supposed to now without self promotion from the founders. Since it doesn't need self promotion to thrive, it doesn't fall victim to the vices of marketing from greedy, charismatic leaders, with overly complex projects. Sure, there's Saylor and Novogratz that sometimes fall into that role. But bitcoin doesn't need them to survive and won't need them when they die. The project works now. It does what it's supposed to and it'll continue to do what it's supposed to. It's the money of the future of our science fiction novels.

There's no Krypto Kris marketing shitty debit cards. There's no charismatic Do Kwon doing a Forbes, Steve Jobs photo shoot with a black t-shirt and a white background. There's no J Powell magically expanding the money supply with a cobol fueled wand, creating a 9 trillion USD balance sheet out of thin air.

BTC takes out the corruption of humans, because the humans that created it stepped away. Sure, people will build corrupt systems around it, but BTC itself is a simple, pure, and elegant vehicle silently ticking away in the background until the ticking becomes so loud that no one can ignore it.

Options trading, a term more familiar and popular among TradFi traders, has begun to make its mark in the crypto circle. 

 Options trading is where traders buy and sell contracts that give them the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an underlying asset at a specified price (strike price) within a certain period or at a specific date. It allows traders to speculate on the future price of assets or hedge against potential price movements without directly owning the asset.

 Options are contracts that give you the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) a cryptocurrency at a specified price (strike price) by a certain date (expiry date). 

 It's like buying an insurance policy on your crypto predictions. You pay a premium upfront, and if the market moves in your favor, you have the opportunity to exercise the option at the strike price for a potential profit. If the market moves against you, your loss is limited to the premium paid.  

Example: Imagine you believe Bitcoin will rise. You buy a call option with a strike price of $50,000, expiring in a month. If Bitcoin climbs to $60,000, you can exercise your option to buy at $50,000 and potentially sell at the market price of $60,000, netting the difference minus the premium. If Bitcoin drops to $40,000, your loss is confined to the premium paid.

Problem with that is newbies and alot of OG's dont trust it, dont want to get into the high risk sh/tcoins or know how to buy the new memecoins on DEX. I also know people will say why buy a memecoin when you can buy Bitcoin or L2 coins. Well, the newbies will buy memecoins just like most of us bought Doge because it was cheap, fun and it's all we heard of and knew. Doge was a newbies entry point for crypto in 2021. So now Doge is bleeding out. That leaves two accessible memecoins on Coinbase,  Shiba inu or Bonk. I think the only answer is Shiba inu. The community is huge and why not have a legit memecoin that we know is not a rug pull for the newbies. if we can hype Shib in 2024 and 2025 like Doge was hyped in 2021, who knows what could happen.

While I know it's not best to ask Reddit for advice sometimes, I also noticed that many of you have really good advice and help a lot. I've learned much from lurking the posts.

Anyway, I was looking for some advice on my portfolio. I plan on holding for as long as I can (like on my deathbed long) and was wondering if anyone could give me advice on what I'm holding.

I'm just curious if I should keep the ones I'm holding or maybe swap for others, etc.
I don't have a lot but I slowly add over time

Current holdings(amount in coins):
Bitcoin: .002
Dot: 7.26
Tezos: 55.5
Sol: 1
Cosmos: 10.5
Eth: .01
Cardano: 77.4
Matic: 104.5

I'm also holding a few random coins like XYO and SEI.

I understand if put in to percentages, that I'm far off from the standard like 70% BTC, 20% eth, 10% whatever. 

Any genuine advice would be great. Should I swap some of these to BTC/eth? Are some of these not worth holding in the long run?

Despite the availability of multiple clients like Nethermind, Besu, Erigon, and others, Geth remains the most popular choice, especially among large staking providers.

This centralization poses a risk not just in terms of security but also for the network's resilience. A bug affecting a widely-used client could disrupt a substantial portion of the network, as was the case in January when an issue took down 8% of Ethereum's validators.

Given the critical role client diversity plays in the ecosystem's health, what are your thoughts on how we, as a community, can encourage more widespread adoption of various clients? 

Do you think initiatives like Coinbase's efforts to diversify their infrastructure are enough, or should there be more concerted efforts across the board? 

What measures can individual users, developers, and stakeholders take to contribute to this diversity and enhance Ethereum's resilience against potential software bugs?

The paid shills and possibly bots were leaving long drawn out defenses for their beloved Cardano, which I thought was strange, because they must have been actively searching for posts like these in order to defend their beloved Ada coin.

You can check my history if you'd like to see what I am referring to, but my point is, the last time this was a thing was the lead up to, and during the last bull run of 2021, so it may be a good sign that the bull might come early this time around... well this and the fact that Bitcoin and Ethereum are approaching all-time highs again, which we all know is when profits are taken, and then put into the alts, kicking off that sweet sweet alt rally and all the gains that will come from it!

Nvidia may set it off early too, because depending on earnings today, all the just in it for the gains folks might sell, and they'll all need a new place to park their money for to earn 100% plus gains this year, and we all know that's got the cryptocurrency market written all over it.

I get the United States me and my business partner would need to file more legal paperwork before we launch as those are considered securities but honestly it's w/e, can't be much more paperwork than selling off equity as is. 

-update-

Yeah after discussion on here and looking at recent ICO drops I'm gonna say no to doing an ICO. the entire field is just way too scammy and we simply cannot and will not tarnish our brand this early on by having it look like some get rich quick scam like most ICOs are. I'm still semi open to the idea but unless we can find a suitable way to differentiate ourself within the space (especially since our company isn't focused 100% specifically on crypto) I'm not gonna bother.

What am I missing?,0,1aw0rh4,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1aw0rh4/why_isnt_amkt_more_popular_what_am_i_missing/,8,"I'll admit, I'd not even really heard of AMKT before I saw /u/Joe-M-4's[ most recent update](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/19bbkvm/i_bought_1k_of_the_top_10_cryptos_on_january_1st/) on his yearly $1,000 buy of the top-ten crypto currencies. I'd probably have dismissed it as just another of the thousands of other coins and tokens on the market these days had it not been for that post, but when I read what it was I had a full-on Eureka moment.

It's not really a coin in its own right, rather it's a bit like an index-fund. If you're not sure what that is, I'll try to explain:

In the non-crypto world, you can (Instead of buying shares from specific companies) invest in something like the S&P500 to invest a little bit in a lot of companies at once. The idea is rather than betting on specific companies, you bet on the market as a whole - market goes up, S&P goes up. If some companies flatline or decline, chances are others will make up for it. 

It's worth knowing that 99 times out of 100, you cannot beat the market and I believe the same is true of Crypto. So a general ""good rule of investment advice"" is just to invest in the S&P500 (Or the FTSE 100) and don't think too much about it. If the economy is good, your investment is good.

So a crypto token that essentially does the same thing -tracks the top 15 coins and weights them by market share - makes a _lot_ of sense. If BTC goes up, it goes up. If ETH goes up, it goes up. If DOGE goes up, it goes up and so on and so forth.

A lot of folks on here will suggest that you just go all-in on BTC - and that's fine. Others suggest a mix of BTC and ETH - which is also fine. You do you. But more often than not, I see people suggesting things like ""70% BTC, 20% ETH and 10% in whatever you want"" - which makes sense from a ""I want to invest in the big boys but I also wouldn't mind having exposure to the smaller coins in the hope they moon a bit"". The idea of something like AMKT is that it does all this for you. And you don't need to think about it, it'll rebalance automatically on your behalf. It's as ""fire and forget"" as crypto investments can get. Even if BTC tanked tomorrow and fell out of the top cryptos, AMKT would rebalance to whatever took its place.

I'm not shilling this, nor am I affiliated in any way with them, I genuinely just think it's a great idea and when people post on here with ""I have x to invest, what should I buy"", I am surprised that nobody is suggesting it. In fact, there's almost _zero_ discussion about AMKT itself, beyond /u/Joe-M-4's yearly updates.

So what am I missing? I feel like I'm taking crazy pills or I've missed something entirely. Why isn't this more popular?",2024-02-21,0

On top of that, a little research showed me that binance chain uses a mechanism whereby your validation power is proportional to your staked bnb.

Would that mean that Binance can fake transactions if they have more than 50% staked bnb?

Option 1: AI Narratives

Considering the rise of AI technologies, some argue that investing in AI-related crypto projects could be a game-changer. Would you put a significant chunk of your budget into AI-driven cryptocurrencies, betting on the potential growth of this sector? 

Option 2: Gaming and NFTs

On the other hand, the gaming and NFT space has been gaining substantial attention. With the metaverse hype and the intersection of gaming and blockchain tech, would you diversify your investment into gaming tokens and NFT projects?

Option 3: Diversification

Alternatively, some investors swear by diversification. Spreading your funds across multiple projects might mitigate risks and capitalize on different sectors within the crypto space. How would you distribute your 10k ‚Äì all in one or two promising projects, or diversify across several?

I'm curious to know your take on this! What factors would influence your decision, and do you have any specific projects in mind? Let's discuss and learn from each other's insights. üöÄ

Is market manipulation too easy for small/micro cap crypto? Like Solana tokens?

I asked because I've traded large caps, and medium caps regularly. Using traditional charts, patterns, and behavior recognition, you could typically make good predictions on how the market will go. With that said, yes there's still market manipulation involved in large, and medium caps, but due to the sheer volume of traders, market manipulators have to use specific methods to move prices.

But when it comes to small and micro caps, market manipulators can zoom in on the individual, move the price, and empty the coffers of larger investors.

For example, you accumulate a large holding of a certain token. On the 5-minute chart it shows all the buys and sells, most small caps have five to maybe 50 transactions happening at one time, along with the wallet data in a list of purchases.

With just a click you can go to the person's wallet and see exactly how many tokens they hold, and if that person stands to cash out in a big way, market manipulators can take the price lower the value and force the person out of their position. 

This leaves the only people who truly benefit from small cap crypto being the token creators, or early whales. Of course every once in awhile someone will tell a story about how they made millions out of $100, which is probably a lure to entice the inexperienced crypto investors.

Now I do have some experience, and I've watched several times as a token is being dumped, where as soon as I hit my stop loss, the price immediately rebounds. When looking at the transactions on the 5-minute charts there are only 8-15 transactions happening. This lets me know that it's a group collectively acting on the price movement, and will force a sell-off if you are too savvy and collect too many tokens.

This is just my opinion, tell me what you think.",2024-02-20,0

Btc dominance is currently at 53%. It peaked at 55% the week of December 4th 2023 and crashed to 50% by the end of December. This is is the same time the stock market broke out. 
Since then it has closed the week and got rejected hard TWICE at the 3rd range boundary of 53%. 

The first time was the pump when etf news came out. And the second time, was valentines day. When btc was at its peak on valentines day hitting it‚Äôs own third range boundary on its price chart.

Two separate events, two different prices. And yet it still got rejected at 53%. This is coming at a time when eth breaks out, and many other coins starting to pop their heads up! Absolutely wild.

That‚Äôs not the only confluence we have though. Valentines day is also when the top two stable coins, usdt and usdc, close the day in new lows after crashing already 61%. From nearly 17% dominance when everyone was shitting themselves in June 2022 to 6% now with btc dominating half the market at 50k a piece. 

It is clear as day people are spending their stable coins and apparently now, their retirement funds mostly on btc ü§Øü§¶ two separate days of positive price action, both getting rejected from taking any larger piece of the pie. 

In conclusion, I think we‚Äôll look back and realize  that the velocity of excitement really peaked out for btc on valentines day. Hopefully we still get an alt season. I wish you all the best of luck.

Typically we see charts and percentage gains calculated from the time of halving. This method anchors Bitcoin price action to dates, rather than price action. In the below chart, we look at the Bitcoin halving cycles, but calculated as of the low price of that cycle. So in the data below, each cycle actually begins BEFORE the halving date.

This method allows us to view Bitcoin's price action THROUGH the halving cycle.

&#x200B;

[SOURCE:  CoinCodex \(price as of \\""close\\""\)](https://preview.redd.it/48ru9iwsosjc1.png?width=866&format=png&auto=webp&s=246cf691bbf96811a8c56b8cb32593a8351b13ca)

The chart below shows each halving cycle.

The x-axis represents how many days past the low.

The y-axis represents the % growth from that cycle low.

The dot marker for each line represents the halving date for that cycle.

So using our current 2024 cycle as an example: Day 0 represents November 22, 2022 when Bitcoin crashed to \~$15,780 after FTX collapsed. We are currently 455 days past that low, and Bitcoin's price today is 228% of that low.

&#x200B;

[SOURCE:  CoinCodex \(daily price as of \\""close\\""\)](https://preview.redd.it/eni2hpavosjc1.png?width=1806&format=png&auto=webp&s=d69ccb0465933e190bc2b28f4600c09909da3742)

So what can we see from this chart?

1. **It takes over 1,000 days for each cycle to reach the new All-Time High (ATH)**
2. **Each new ATH has become an increasingly lower % of the low**
3. **Our current 2024 cycle is tracking well to previous cycles**

This data would suggest that we are \~500 days from our next ATH, with the ATH coming in closer to 8-10x of the low ($120-160k).

That being said, obviously this is all bullshit. It's really impossible to observe trends with only a few data points, especially considering the massive economic variables not shown in the chart (10 year bull market, near zero interest rates, Covid, spot ETFs, etc). It is tough not to be excited though when we take a step back and realize Bitcoin is sitting at $52k today, a few months before the halving, with institutional money just beginning to pour in.

Solana's posted inflation schedule is adrift from reality. The asterisk symbol is its only truthful piece of information. So let's follow it and see where it leads.

[These figures are misleading](https://preview.redd.it/b0c8kozaqrjc1.png?width=717&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ef25f0224d7e0ac35e1fc3169cbb11fabc992d9)

# EPOCH YEAR

From Solana Official Docs:  Solana's annual inflation is currently 5.515%. Note that this is an 'epoch-year', or \~ 180 epochs.

Okay now WTF is an epoch-year? An easier explanation than this.

**MEANWHILE ON PLANET SOL**

On Planet Sol, a year spans 180 epochs.  1 epoch = 2.5+ days.  Epoch years range 450 to 630 Earth days.  See for yourself.

[Actual inflation rate will vary](https://preview.redd.it/2t6vibotqrjc1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b0e74de593a8154ad09a9f8500484a683d4a702)

But hold on.  ""Non-stakers pay stakers?"" What's that about? Merits a closer look.

# NON-STAKERS PAY STAKERS

New SOL issue pays Validators. Solana rewards remaining new issue to Stakers.

Problem: New SOL inflates currency and fee burn's insufficient.

Solution: Reward shields Stakers from inflation. Non-Stakers get no reward.  Non-Stakers pay for inflation. They become the yield for Solana stakers.

Non-Stakers Pay Stakers.

For those who asked, No, Solana DOES NOT have a fixed supply. Its MAX supply is like a moving island that flows upstream.

By 2032, Solana expects to circulate around 775 Million SOL

Solana's definitely a performer. Smart investors can earn so long as they're mindful of its tokenomics issues.

Over the last 12-months, 1000% ROI.üî•

# SOL to $1000;CAP to $441 Billion

* $45 Billion market cap must climb to $441 Billion to reach $1000 p/c
* To achieve that, it must capture greater share of DeFi & NFT market
* To have a chance at those markets, Solana can't tip over. Like never again.
* Solana must raise its fees

Solana's current fee structure guarantees it can never compete with Ethereum.

[Solana isn't collecting enough in fees ](https://preview.redd.it/tv9gev31ezjc1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d4a08ef6a04712beb7a28d5b9ba7aefa4e38799)

# CLOSED-SOURCE CENTRALIZATION

Etherscan is an open book for crypto projects. Right down to the source-code.

Go on Solscan and good look finding any open-source code.

High node count and active devs are canceled out by Solana's closed-source smart contracts for:

* DeFi
* NFTs

One person can change the code at any time without notice. This is the same as CeFi or proprietary apps; not crypto or open-source.

Isn't possible these hedge funds accumulated crypto overtime for a while through coinbase, their custodian, making the inflows not impacting the market at all at the moment? 

If they accumulated crypto at a lower price point, the shares they are selling are at current price but this liquidity would go straight to their pocket not actually pouring into the market. I'm not sure if I'm missing something but I don't see why this wouldn't be possible. What are your thoughts?

2845,Yield Farming vs Staking,18,1avjxrn,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1avjxrn/yield_farming_vs_staking/,22,"In the world of decentralized finance (DeFi), two popular methods for earning passive income are yield farming and staking. Both offer unique opportunities and risks, making them compelling options for investors looking to maximize their digital asset holdings.

**Yield Farming:**  
Yield farming, at its core, involves providing liquidity to a DeFi protocol in exchange for rewards. It‚Äôs akin to being a stakeholder in a bank, where your deposited funds are used for various financial activities, and you receive a portion of the profits in return. Yield farmers deposit cryptocurrencies into liquidity pools, which are essentially smart contracts containing funds. In return, they receive liquidity provider (LP) tokens, which can then be used in various ways to earn additional rewards.

**Staking:**  
Staking, on the other hand, is the process of actively participating in transaction validation (similar to mining) on a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain. By locking up their tokens, stakers help maintain the network's security and efficiency. As a reward, they receive a portion of the transaction fees or newly minted tokens. This process is less resource-intensive compared to traditional mining and offers a more predictable income stream.

Sorry if this post doesn't align with the spirit of this subreddit. If so, please suggest where I should post instead.  
I'm exploring the option of sending a significant amount of money to my spouse in the US using cryptocurrency (thinking about USDT). As a non-resident living outside the US, I have a few questions:

Are there any US gift tax implications for sending crypto to a US citizen spouse? How does it work for non-residents?

I'm also interested in understanding the most efficient way to transfer crypto in this context. Any insights on minimizing fees and ensuring a smooth transaction would be appreciated.   
I could send it through conventional means like SWIFT but the fees are around 5% and I wanted to see if there are more cost-efficient solutions.

####NEVER KEEP YOUR COINS ON A CEX.

In the last years it became clear that most CEX - just like banks - recreated *fractional reserve cryptobanking*. Therefore it is necessary to know your risk when dealing with those entities. A best practice if one wants to use a CEX in a more safe way is to keep your money for as short a s possible under the control of the CEX, It helps the CEX staying honest and it will save you some headaches in case something goes wrong. In that sense centralized instant swap services (non-custodial CEX) with all their downsides may in some cases be preferable over regular custodial CEX aka cryptobanks. ""Good"" exchanges will even tell you about the risks and recommend you to not store your coins with them.

####USE NON-CUSTODIAL CEX (INSTANT SWAP EXCHANGES) WITH CAUTION

Centralized instant swap exchanges which come with their own set of problems and risks can be a good way for many to route around CEX, But often they come with higher fees, shotgun KYC or are selective scams like ""Changelly"" and depending on liquidity they can halt or freeze the exchange process.

Best to use an aggregator like Trocador.app that has a security bond for transactions of up to $1000 and gives you a clear indication about competitive pricing and KYC risk.

#What exchanges to use then?
There are plenty of better however still more inconvenient solutions that are preferable over using KYC/CEX:


Exchange method | Exchanges| Trust level
---|---|----
DEX | bisq, Haveno | ‚úÖ escrow
P2P | LocalMonero. AgoraDesk, Robosats, Zapit, Peach Bitcoin| ‚úÖ escrow

Electricity | XMRrig, Monero GUI, Grupax | ‚úÖ trustless
Earning | any products or services | low - ‚ö†Ô∏è high (scams)

Buy 1 ETH for $3,000

Stake ETH into stETH

Turn stETH into wstETH

Use wstETH to mint mkUSD

Use mkUSD to borrow more ETH

Stake ETH into stETH...

This is how you create magic money and turn 3k into 30k. You double, triple, quadruple count the same collateral aka leverage it.  DeFi's total market cap pumps dozens of billions overnight in a bull market and also crashes 90% in a bear market because of it.  It's all FAKE money.   You create more ""money"" from nothing and stablecoins are a key ingredient in that recipe. They allow you to leverage up, fast.  This is no different than fractional reserve banking where your $3,000 bank deposit turns into $29,999 new money created from thin air.  To achieve such a feat, it takes 100 cycles of deposits. See my picture.   Crypto never reaches 100 cycles, because the bubble bursts sooner rather than later.   Fiat ""economists"" even call this process a ""business cycle"". A more appropriate name is a bubble driven by ponzinomics and irresponsible money creation due to greed.   If you read crypto twitter, you will see people talk about liquid staked tokens (LST like stETH) and liquid re-staking tokens (LRTs like reETH) as the next best thing in crypto since sliced bread.   WRONG.   It's the next big bubble or ponzi. EigenLayer should not excite you, it should WORRY you!

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n47f7x0odpjc1.jpg?width=1009&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fab228a6e2c2c54328ce4906bf105a81405ed0fe

Once you start seeing this ""amazing"" new LRT token being used to mint stablecoins on your X feed know that the bubble is about to reach its peak.  The higher the market cap of those new shinny stablecoins backed by LRTs tokens, the bigger the bubble.   Remember, $3,000 is the actual collateral for $30,000! That's a 10x leverage.   If ETH is 3k and it crashes by 10% or $300, the bubble deflates by 3k! That's 3k gone in your new shiny LRT stablecoin!   Such stablecoins will go to zero in the worst case scenario. This is how a liquidation cascade starts and panic begins.   Why does this concern me?   Because it will hurt native ETH holders that don't even stake their ETH. Picture this.  Let's say the LRT bubble grows to $50 billion. Actual backing? $5 billion in ETH or even less.   How exactly can $50 billion exit or sell at a profit using $5 billion of ETH collateral?  It can't.

What happens next is people get wiped out. LST and LRT tokens crash vs ETH's price by 10%, 50% or more. Any stables backed by LST/LRT tokens depeg and crash even more.  In the process, as $50 billion of fake money wants to exit, it will drag down ETH's price beyond a normal correction or crash. ETH is the liquidity of last resort for LST/LRT tokens.  Worse. It will drag down BTC's price as well. Because people will become DESPERATE to exit at ALL costs, even if they lose 50% of their money or more. BTC is the liquidity of last resort in crypto, just like the Fed for USD.  This is why bear markets are BRUTAL. They correct such imbalances. They are necessary and do well to punish such greed.   Don't believe me?   Have you heard of Blast L2? That's an ENTIRE network that will use LST tokens and stablecoins backed by LSTs to give its users ""native yield"".   Those users have no idea what's coming in the next two years and they deposited BILLIONS on Blast L2.   Projects always seek to create more yield to attract users, but that comes at the risk of an entire network like Blast going insolvent if they don't control their greed.   Do you trust them to put breaks on making free money?

In the last crypto cycle, Terra Luna UST imploded to 0 from $50 billion. It also used a stablecoin for their project. It double, triple, quadruple counted the same money while pretending it was real. Greed took over.  You need to EXIT early and well before that $5 billion in real collateral is gone. Cash out and don't ape back. That includes removing all assets from networks like Blast L2.   You are only safe on NATIVE chains like ETH or BTC.  This time, the bubble will use ETH LRTs and associated stablecoins. I'm concerned and few people will write about this because it puts a break on this bubble and greed.  I've seen too many crypto cycles repeat the same story.

This is nothing new. At the end of the day, crypto is a free for all. There's no regulation, but at least we can educate.   Why risk your ETH for 3-6% yield when ETH will 2-5X this cycle?   Funny enough, this LST/LRT bubble will also be the reason ETH will pump hard because all those tokens will LOCK-UP ETH as collateral in a huge pyramid.   When Vitalik decided to take Ethereum from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake he enabled and allowed the creation of such ponzimonic mechanisms.   For this reason alone, Bitcoin is superior.   Don't be fooled by this market and don't let greed take over. It ends badly.

Trying to post his on a mobile browser is a terrible experience. Sorry about that! And LTC is down 27%. My god, where did I get this math?

A few notes: Even though I tried to put $865 equally into each project, some were not exactly $865. Some were maybe $850, while others were $870, but the majority were closer to exactly $865. And the total of X and Y coins purchased might actually be off by a few percent because I rounded off some when adding it to my portfolio tracker. I also used many different modes of purchasing the coins to avoid getting hacked and losing it all, from eToro to Binance to Coinbase. Also, some were purchased a few days later but the majority were purchased on July 12th.

Here is a [screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/Z8PRNQE.jpeg) of my portfolio tracker. What I took away from this investment experience is:

1. Diversification is king.
2. This was a huge gamble.
3. I plan on doing this when the market crashes by 75%.
4. **I wish I had DCAed.** I honestly have no idea why I did not. There were times I could have bought the best performing ones at a major discount.
5. Reverse r/CC.
6. Due to a few kings (HNT, SOL... I know it is hated here, RUNE, and INJ), I was able to pretty much 2x my investment.
7. LTC what the hell are you doing?

My advice to you:

1. Do not invest in any of the crypto projects that have already 5x or 10x. They will not retain their value. I have done this many times since 2017, and every project in my portfolio that has done 5x or 10x in the last year has fallen just as much during a bear market.
2. Funnily enough, even though LTC was my worst-performing one, it was actually the most resistant to price crashes during the bear market. At a few times, it was actually up tremendously %wise, but I never sold because the gains were minimal $wise and not worth it at that time, relatively speaking. So even though it was the worst performing, it is actually a good store of value if you do not care about long-term gains.
3. Seriously, do not buy any crypto projects that have already *mooned*.",2024-02-20,0

I took most of my crypto to other exchanges when they first blocked US users but I didn't move my Monero at the time because not many exchanges supported it so I just left it and said I would figure it out later (yeah dumb move, I should have put it in my own self custody wallet at that point).

Now with it being delisted from binance I am trying to get it out but as a US user I am only allowed to withdrawal (can't trade) and Monero withdrawals are currently suspended. To complicate things customer support says as a US user I only have 7 days to withdraw before my account is blocked again (maybe for good).

I am not sure how I am going to get my Monero out at this point. Anyone else in a similar situation to me? Any advice?",2024-02-20,0

I realized this when last year I wanted to send my nephew a bit of BTC as birthday gift, but didn't want to reveal the balance of my wallet. (I know I can transfer it to exchanges then to him, but this defies the purpose of crypto). 

I appreciate the function of store of value rather than the medium of exchange (stablecoins do better in this) of Bitcoin. 

At the moment, Monero is the most successful privacy coin. Other than privacy, it has two other features: a) 2 minutes block time (v.s. 10 mins of Bitcoin), b) tail emission: miners are reward 0.6 XMR for each mined block forever.

As far as I understand, the 2 mins block time of Monero is to facilitate the function as medium of exchange. The tail emission is to ensure the network exists in the long run in case miners only view it as a medium of exchange. (If miners view it as a store of value, they would speculate that the transactions fees in $ would be high enough to compensate the mining cost).

The downside of 2 mins block time is the blockchain size is huge. It takes quite long to sync the balance on Monero wallet unless you run a 24/7 node. The downside of tail emission, is the supply is infinite although it is still disinflationary in the sense that the inflation rate converges to 0% in long run.

What do you all think about a version of Bitcoin that is fully private like Monero? Let it retain the other features like 10 mins block time and the max cap of 21 mil tokens.",2024-02-19,0

Yes, I can imagine we all want to earn interest on our Bitcoin if nothing else to just have more (we can't have enough). 

But the systems just aren't there yet. The lack of any sense of regulatory safety (dirty words, I know) means that coins are simply subject to their own TOS that can change at a whim and does nothing for you as a consumer

No matter the ""military grade"" security or insurances, it doesn't matter when shit truly goes down. An apology and a ""sorry we fucked ya"" is all you will get.

Personally, I would only ever begin to ""trust"" fully regulated organizations and even then, as a far as I can throw 'em. 

True, non custodial, true risk free interest bearing assets, imo, as of this moment, are simply not possible, in terms of Bitcoin. (So no, I'm not advocating for Bitcoin ""banks"", just saying that government backed insurance to me still carry a bit more weight, I'm not a total anarchist üòâ)

Gaming on the blockchain would very likely be slower than doing it centralized, probably more costly for the end user as we would pay for transactions which are now being processed by the game developers/distributors.

I can‚Äôt think of a single argument why gaming would need a blockchain, anything that can be done on a blockchain can be done just as well, if not better on a centralized system.



-(re)selling of skins? Can already be done on steam.

-reselling of games currently can‚Äôt be done, but why would any distributor/developer want to help in facilitating this, it will cost them revenue.

2890,Privacy on Ethereum: a different approach from Tornado Cash,0,1auf3v1,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1auf3v1/privacy_on_ethereum_a_different_approach_from/,7,"One of the biggest problems cryptocurrency faces right now is the US government setting a dangerous precedent by criminalizing the largest privacy project in the space: Ethereum's Tornado Cash smart contract.

It's hard to overstate how harmful this is to cryptocurrency adoption. Without privacy, cryptocurrency can never be a mainstream financial instrument for retail and business payments. There is just too much risk in conducting payments on a financial platform that leaks all of your financial activity to the world.

The justification for the sanctions on Tornado Cash is to stop North Korea from laundering the proceeds of its crypto heists through Tornado Cash, but reports since the sanctions were implemented suggest the sanctions have done nothing at all to slow North Korea's crypto theft efforts.

Meanwhile, the sanctions have had a devastating chilling effect on the privacy space on Ethereum, and with it, hopes of a crypto payment system that is viable for mainstream use. This, in turn, has stunted the development of an industry that promised to give liberal democracies, like the US, a significant economic advantage over authoritarian states that naturally reject cryptocurrency. In other words, to marginally constrain the fundraising efforts of a minor geopolitical threat ‚Äî North Korea ‚Äî the US has forfeited a major geopolitical advantage over peer rivals like Russia and China through stifling the development of a burgeoning crypto sector centered in the US and its European allies.

Needless to say, I see the potential criminalization of all privacy on the blockchain that the Tornado Cash sanctions portends as disastrous on every front, and worthy of lobbying against at every turn.

One way the crypto space could push back against the surveillance state and its anti-privacy efforts is to develop a legal privacy protocol and make it wildly successful. The more successful a privacy protocol is, the more political protection it has against potentials prohibitions.

So far, standalone crypto privacy protocols like Zcash and Monero have escaped legal sanctions, and I think a strong argument can be made that this is purely due to aesthetics.

The Tornado Cash smart contract address on Ethereum was mistakenly viewed by regulators as a custodian of funds and by a judge as a traditional business contract that could be construed as property of a definable entity (see Van Loon v. Department of Treasury viewing the TC smart contract as property of Tornado Cash's developers), thus becoming a target of sanctions law. In contrast, off-chain privacy protocols like Zcash don't face this issue as their transaction encryption mechanisms that clients call to shield transactions are off-chain, eliminating the misinterpretation of a smart contract address as a custodial address.

So on that basis I asked ChatGPT to devise an Ethereum-based private transaction scheme that avoids the main problem with Tornado Cash: the reliance on constant addresses.

The scheme described is a sophisticated system designed to facilitate private transactions on the Ethereum blockchain without relying on any constant smart contract address. It achieves this through a combination of off-chain computation, zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), a dynamic address discovery mechanism, and on-chain verification. Here's an overview of the entire scheme, from setup to execution:

- **Setup Phase**
  - Development of On-Chain Verifier Contracts: Multiple verifier contracts are deployed on the Ethereum blockchain over time. These contracts are responsible for verifying the ZKPs submitted to them. The addresses of these contracts can change.
  - Implementation of a Dynamic Address Discovery Mechanism: A system is set up to enable the discovery of the current addresses of the verifier contracts. This could be a smart contract that acts as a registry, a decentralized naming service like Ethereum Name Service (ENS), or another form of decentralized identifier (DID) system.
  - Establishment of Off-Chain Computation Nodes: These nodes are set up to handle transaction details (like amounts and recipients) off the Ethereum blockchain. They are responsible for generating ZKPs that prove the validity of transactions without revealing their contents.
  - Creation of an Off-Chain Transaction Pool: A mechanism is established to pool transaction requests. This adds an additional layer of privacy and aggregation.

- **Operation Phase**
  - Transaction Initiation: A user initiates a transaction by sending its details to an off-chain computation node. This can include the recipient's address, the amount, and other relevant data.
  - Off-Chain Computation and Proof Generation: The off-chain node processes the transaction details and generates a ZKP. This proof attests to the validity of the transaction without revealing any specific details about it.
  - Dynamic Address Lookup: Before submitting the proof to the blockchain, the off-chain node (or the user) uses the dynamic address discovery mechanism to find the current address of the appropriate on-chain verifier contract.
  - Proof Submission: The ZKP is submitted to the discovered address of the on-chain verifier contract.
  - On-Chain Verification: The verifier contract, identified via the dynamic discovery mechanism, verifies the proof. If the proof is valid, it confirms the legitimacy of the transaction.
  - Executing the Transaction: Following successful verification, the transaction can be executed on the blockchain. This could involve updating states, transferring funds, or interacting with other contracts.

**How it Avoids Constant Ethereum Addresses**
- By using a dynamic address discovery mechanism instead of a fixed address for the verifier contract, the system can seamlessly function with changing addresses.
- The decentralized and flexible infrastructure, including multiple verifier contracts and a system for dynamically discovering their addresses, avoids dependency on any single contract's address.
- Handling sensitive transaction details off-chain removes the need to interact directly with a specific on-chain contract for processing these details.

**Advantages**
- The scheme provides enhanced privacy through the use of ZKPs and reduces blockchain load by offloading computation.
- It offers flexibility and upgradability without disrupting existing processes.

**Challenges**
- The technical complexity and dependence on off-chain components require sophisticated cryptography and smart contract development.
- Potential latency issues due to the multi-step process, especially the dynamic discovery of contract addresses, could introduce delays.

In summary, this advanced scheme represents a privacy-preserving approach for conducting transactions on Ethereum, circumventing the need for a constant smart contract address.",2024-02-19,0

This is the 2nd year in a row I've used zenledger mainly cuz most other tax platforms don't integrate well with Nexo. 

I learned my lesson after 2022 taxes so last year I moved my funds on nexo to where the rest of my funds are on coinbase. Here I'm thinking ""I only have a small # of transactions on nexo, I'll format my csv, plug in the coinbase API and I'll be golden""... WRONG

I waste 4+ hrs Sat cuz zenledger can't do basic math. For example: if I convert 0.5 eth to 0.5 cbeth and then sell that eth moments later what is the total price? Answer: insufficient balance you sold this with a balance of 0 cbeth in your coinbase wallet. Turns out zen ledger doesn't understand conversions and the online support after hrs of back n forth struggled to understand why it wouldn't count the conversions when I followed their directions step by step ho get the API key setup...

Their answer on Sunday. Manually add in transactions for every cbeth conversion you did last year. Okay simple enough I guess... except it's not cuz the site is glitchy and if u make one mistake then you have to delete your csv file and start over. After starting over multiple times I finally get close to being done but my capital gains look way off so I refresh the Coinbase API which in turn deleted all my manual transactions... 6+hrs of entering in data later and I finally think I've got it ready to go... 

Wrong again. My eth balance on coinbase according to zenledger is still 0.17 eth off from where it should be and now the option to edit transactions and review is gone and I wasn't done editing. Plus logging in and out/refreshing the screen isn't working... Okay wtf

Are they maybe trying to mimic by BTC amount purchases when I setup the recurring buy? I am at a loss.

I looked into it and found an even more interesting (potentially big) fact:

**Between 2017 and 2021, the total supply of Bitcoin increased** ***faster*** **than USD inflation**: 

* the total supply of Bitcoin went up by 12,8%, while 
* USD inflation went up by 10,5%. 
* This means that if we adjust for inflation AND the increased supply, the high of 20k$ in 2017 was ""worth"" 19,6k$ by 2021 (-1%). 

**Between 2021 and 2024, the total supply of Bitcoin increased** ***slower*** **than USD inflation**: 

* the total supply of Bitcoin went up by 3,8%, while 
* USD inflation went up by 13,8%. 
* This means that if we adjust for inflation AND the increased supply, the all-time-high of 69k$ in 2021 is now ""worth"" 75,7k$ (+9,7%). 

**Conclusion****: this is first cycle during which the total supply of Bitcoin has increased slower than USD inflation**, and we can reasonably expect this to be the norm from now on. 

Obviously, it's also fair to point out that there is no real rationale behind the all-time-highs of Bitcoin (so none of this really means anything), and that USD is not the only currency in which Bitcoin is being traded. This analysis is just for fun, but still interesting to think about, I think.

I hope my math is correct, the calculations are based on these figures ([sauce](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/total-bitcoins)) plus the ones from my previous post:

Protocol level governance makes Zenon future-proof and the ability to support virtually any execution environment in silo‚Äôd virtual machines makes it the ideal base layer for the rapidly advancing needs of developers.

Today, Bitcoin consumes the most computing power in the world. The problem is that there is no decentralized way to efficiently direct this computing power. As such, tremendous power rests in the hands of a few. 

As technology such as AI advances, and the global demand for computational energy emerges, it will become absolutely crucial that this power is decentralized. 

To solve this problem, anonymous developers fair-launched the Zennon network in 2019, and through a process of progressive decentralization, the Zennon network is now fully decentralized. 

Zennon is strategically positioned as the only decentralized Layer 1 network to guarantee equal access and opportunity for all people of the world. Zenon will enable unprecedented digital security and peace of mind while rapidly activating new economies throughout the world. 

Zenon Network is also enabling the secure and censorship resistant internet. Zenon will ensure their fair access to reliable information, uncensored news, private communication, and educational resources.

An honest, inclusive, and prosperous future depends upon decentralized operators, developers, and people like you. Never underestimate your ability to create the future. Join Zennon and participate in the decentralized future, today. The revolution will be Zenonized.

While Trezor on the other hand does not support as many cryptos but is adorn by most due to its open source code and security.

I was hoping to get some user experience on these as YouTube reviews and online articles can only tell you so much.

People who have been here for at least 1 bull/bear cycle know exactly how this works. As crypto start to get popular again, it becomes a honey pot for scams and grifters. Some of them are obvious, while others are pretty sophisticated. I want to share a very recent personal experience so you can also be prepared. **Never underestimate scammers.**

So I have been in the space for a good while (first interaction back in 2017 where I wrote a paper on bitcoin as a postgrad student in finance), and I always had this goal in mind of eventually working for a crypto project, or a company associated with crypto (like analytics companies or credible news sites). I have also been job hunting for the past few weeks, mostly in tradfi. The fact that I have engaged with recruiters in the traditional finance sector, made me forget how scammy the crypto industry usually is.

I have also found some job ads online about ""Financial Analysts"" or ""Crypto Market Researchers"" and I have decided to apply to some; the job descriptions looked ideal for my skills and background.

So I have been contacted by an ""HR representative from 0x"", regarding my application. I immediately got excited because I am familiar with 0x as a crypto project. They asked me some questions via email and I replied. Nothing fancy, stuff like ""what's your experience with crypto, what's your desired salary, etc."" 

Then the ""HR rep"" sent me a link to book a meeting with them via a meeting platform, which I never heard of, but looked legit. Since I have used various (previously unknown) platforms for such meetings, (I've worked as a Business Analyst and I've frequently used different platforms for meetings with software engineers, web developers etc.), I didn't get suspicious of it.

So I went to book my meeting with them by entering the ""meeting code"" I was provided and I immediately saw that the browser tried to download something (I use windows). My heart dropped immediately as I realised this was definitely sketchy. I immediately went and ran anti-virus checks and thankfully the download was blocked by my anti-virus with the notification ""malware detected"". It still took me like 10 mins to calm down because I am fairly sure they can get access to all sort of passwords if they actually infected my pc.

I am still not very relaxed about it and I reported that recruiter. I thought it seemed too good to be true but again, a lot of factors of recent experiences made me get complacent. I am usually very, very sceptical, especially when it comes to crypto. 

I know that many of you here eventually would like to work for a legit project in the industry, and so do I. But please, always be extra careful when interacting with ANYTHING NEW. Whether it is a recruiter, a new platform, a dapp, a coin, a person etc. **ALWAYS be sceptical.** The centralised internet is not safe, so imagine how a decentralised one would look like. 

Please keep this in the back of your mind for the future as well. **If and when the industry grows organically, so will the scammers, and so will the sophistication of their schemes.** Have a good day.",2024-02-18,0

	‚Ä¢	While I previously lived in the US, I‚Äôm not a resident there anymore. I have an active credit card for specific services and regularly transfer money from Japan to the US to settle the balance.
	‚Ä¢	Despite residing in Japan, I‚Äôm unable to purchase crypto due to my non-resident status.

I‚Äôm considering sending my savings in Euros to my Spanish account to facilitate the purchase, but I‚Äôm concerned about potential taxation implications in Spain, especially since I‚Äôve never dealt with Spanish taxes and I‚Äôm not a resident there.

Additionally, I‚Äôm open to buying from the US, but I‚Äôm unsure about the tax implications with the IRS. Exchanges often ask for residency, and since I‚Äôm not a resident in the US anymore, it adds another layer of complexity.

I‚Äôve had negative experiences with exchanges so keep all my crypto on self storage. I don‚Äôt want to sell my portfolio but want to see if there are any privacy first ways of spending.

If anyone has any recommendations please let me know.

2921,Awareness of Fake Rabby Wallet app in Appstore that has Drained many people's crypto!,30,1atfvgy,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1atfvgy/awareness_of_fake_rabby_wallet_app_in_appstore/,17,"I am making this post with the hope that many of us help Report, leave a review to prevent others from falling for the scam, and if someone knows someone in a position to help at Apple, to hopefully get it taken care of because people have lots their life savings because of this Fake Wallet App

I created a post on Apple Discussions to hopefully get awareness and some eyes, if it can be upvoted there also: [https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255482851?sortBy=best](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255482851?sortBy=best)

This has been reported by many people, but the app is still in the appstore.  The problem is the Real Rabby Wallet ([https://rabby.io)](https://rabby.io)/) has an app under review by apple, so this scammer's approved AppStore App called ""Rabby Wallet & Crypto Solution"" is tricking people into thinking it is the genuine one, they enter they seed phrase or private key, and moments later all of their life savings, crypto belongings are GONE!  

The Genuine Rabby Wallet not out yet is made by Debank,  this fake one is made by some obscure company.  What is very concerning is how a closed ecosystem like Apple Appstore would allow blatant use of the real logo, impersonating the real wallet, causing to huge amount of funds lost (I have seen well over $100k stolen already from the Rabby Discord) 

Apple needs to take down this application and help those users, it has been up for 4 days, with many reports and reviews submitted (by myself and others) 

The Fake Rabby Wallet Appstore Link: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rabby-wallet-crypto-solution/id6477841721](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rabby-wallet-crypto-solution/id6477841721) (They have since bought various fake reviews, just look at the fake names)  Mine is not published but you can see one that was that says they are farming private keys. 

If anyone knows how to escalate this with someone at apple, please do! Lets make sure no one else gets scammed!  This is insane and should NEVER happen on Apple Ecosystem, how does a counterfeit Crypto Wallet make it on the appstore that just steals their money posing as the real one. 

Here is the tweet from Official Rabby Account warning: [https://twitter.com/Rabby\_io/status/1758476458559738181](https://twitter.com/Rabby_io/status/1758476458559738181)

2937,Let's not get scammed,31,1asxgsx,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1asxgsx/lets_not_get_scammed/,30,"Hi everyone, I'm making this post because this mental model has helped me avoid getting scammed in the past and I figure if it helps one of you then it's worth it. This model relates crypto actions to classic banking to help identity actions that aren't safe.

1) Giving out your seed phrase. 
This is like giving someone your credit card number, expiry date and pin and telling them to go wild.  NEVER give out your seed phrase to anyone, ever. Scams that say they need it are like someone telling you they need your card and pin to allow you to use Amazon or something - clear BS.

 2) Connecting your wallet to a site.
This doesn't have a clear equivalent in tradfi but it is a bit like putting your credit card down to pay in a restaurant. If we forget about contactless payments for a moment, the restaurant has your card and some details but can't make a payment because they don't have your pin.

Connecting your wallet should therefore be treated like this - would you trust that site to have your card details other than pin? If not, don't connect!

Connecting your wallet should NOT involve signing a transaction. If it does, that is a scam most likely.


3) Signing a transaction
This is like putting your credit card into a terminal and entering your pin. So, this is ok for a legitimate site but absolutely not ok for an illegitimate one. 

Something to be aware of is that in crypto when you sign a transaction, this comes with a separate thing called token approval and the amount approved is often infinite. In that case you trust the site to only take what they said they would. This is a bit like in tradfi entering your pin into a terminal that says infinite $ as the amount, and then trusting the terminal owner to only take an amount of $ that they said they would.

To avoid this, you can set a finite spending amount in your wallet. Most wallets now offer this as part of the transaction, you can usually press 'max' to set the approval amount to the transaction amount. In that case, you only allow the site to take whatever number of tokens you specified, not all of them.

Also consider getting a transaction previewing app like Pocket Universe or Fire. These are browser extensions that will preview what a transaction will do if you sign it, so you can avoid signing transactions that are going to drain your wallet.

Approvals of infinite amounts of tokens last forever. To end them, go to a contract approval checker like Unrekt and revoke the approvals.

4) Giving out your public (wallet) address
This is like giving someone your bank account number and sort code so that they can pay you. It is safe to do this as there's no way someone can steal your tokens just from having your public address.

It is worth keeping in mind that in crypto, everyone can see your transactions. So if you give someone your public address, they get the ability to see everything you've done with that wallet and wallets related to it. For this reason, you may want to set up multiple wallets that never interact with one another to keep some of your activities pseudononomous.

That's it, hope this is useful for someone. Stay safe out there everyone!",2024-02-17,0

Sorry for the probably confusing title. Here is my situation:

I was involved in the Celsius meltdown, and when I got my ETH and LINK back from them, I created a MM wallet linked to my Trezor Wallet to store the ETH and LINK in. When I created the Trezor wallet, I immediately wrote down my passphrase as always, and placed it in two places. This ensures that I know exactly what the password was (no confusion with two copies of it), and if one somehow disappears or is involved in a flood/fire, I have a backup I can take action with.

When I created the Trezor wallet, I also created an associated MM wallet, I entered in my passphrase as I always do and transferred my ETH/LINK from Celsius to MM. Now this was months ago. Today, I go to move my ETH/LINK to a different wallet provider (Rabby) and come to find out that the wallet address associated with the MM wallet is different than the wallet address associated with my passphrase. This indicates to me that either 1) some error occurred in my entering of the passphrase. But let me say, I am so anal about this stuff, there is no way that this happened. I am the type of person to look at my passphrase/where I'm sending coins/etc. 10+ times before actually performing an action. **OR** 2) There was some issue with MM.

Believe me, I am also the type of person that would totally take immediate credit if I was just plain negligent. But that's not me. There is of course a non-zero probability that I somehow fat-fingered this, which I am struggling to come to grips with. The result in either case is the same. End rant.

**What the hell do I do now.**

If the passphrase is effectively an extra word in the seed phrase, is it possible to brute force the passphrase if you have the remaining words and the general idea of what the final word was? How would I go about doing so other than painstakingly by hand?

Also, if it wasn't my fat-fingered mistake, how would I even proceed? Feels like in either way I'm screwed. Feel free to roast, but could use some support. No small sum in this wallet. Thanks in advance.",2024-02-17,0

1) I took a 2 year + break from crpyto news purchases, everything to give me some sanity. i came back because i saw increasing articles on mainstream news about an upcoming bullrun and thought it was time to pull my coins from my ledger to my coinbase account. 

2) mistake 1 - i didn't take the time to read up on recent scams. the nft drop about staking was just pure coincidental bad timing. that dude got lucky and got my shit. be honest and ask yourselves if you are aware of the latest types of scams. they are an amorphous beast.

3) mistake 2 - being bone fucking tired and doing financial shit. I should have gone to bed but told myself to get this one thing done and not have to worry about it tomorrow. well that was the mistake as i wasn't thinking straight. just don't rush i guess is problem i haven't solved yet.

4) scams are not just technical. I'm smart and you are smart but we all do dumb things if we lack exposure. the scam itself isn't just a technical thing but more psychological. if you think you can't fall for it you are wrong. i was overconfident too. 

5) a cold wallet isn't as secure as you think. this gave me a false sense of security and it shouldn't have. the only positive is...

6) i didn't have my eggs in one basket. seriously don't have a single pile in one place. shit happens and backups are SOP.

7) it is just money but it's the loss of plans that sucks more. I believe we all have plans for our funds and when anyone looses a chunk of money all at once there is that realization of how much time you lost and not really money.

2946,The new RENDER is on Coinbase!,0,1ass3ao,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ass3ao/the_new_render_is_on_coinbase/,11,"We can officially convert from RNDR to RENDER on Coinbase.

If you press the convert button, the fees are high and u will lose about 3% of your RNDR. So if you have a 100 RNDR you will only have ~97 RENDER.

However if you sell your RNDR in Coinbase's Advanced Trader view and then buy the new RENDER as a limit order buy, you will only lose about ~1%. So for 100 RNDR you will get about 98.8 RENDER.

Not sure how tax implications work when u convert vs buy and sell. But I wanted to share to the fam! Hope this helps some of yall!",2024-02-17,0

For example, if I have $100 at 25x long on BTC/USD at btc = $50,000, then I wanted to ADD or HEDGE that position with SHORT $50 at btc = $52,000, then I own both positions simultaneously, as opposed to selling of the existing long position.

Does that make sense? I had good fortune with this before the restrictions Binance imposed on US customers

I remember using a VPN I think to achieve this but it's been cracked down on...

# About Pink Drainer

I've talked about the rise of Pink Drainer in previous posts. Pink Drainer is a threat group primarily using phishing tactics to drain victims wallets across many different chains. Additionally, this group has been known to use social engineering to take over influencer social media accounts.

It's relatively easy for the scammer/hacker to setup a malicious website with Pink Drainer code. This particular victim was targeted with an approval phishing scam. According to Chainalysis, victims have lost over $1 Billion to approval scams since May of 2021.

Since April of 2023, Pink Drainer has stolen over31M across 11,785 victims.

2953,AMA: Salty.IO - a Zero Fee Ethereum DEX Pioneering Automatic Arbitrage! Feb 18th 8-10pm (GMT+0),25,1aslgak,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1aslgak/ama_saltyio_a_zero_fee_ethereum_dex_pioneering/,47,"Salty.IO is a decentralized exchange on Ethereum which has pioneered Automatic Atomic Arbitrage (AAA) to generate yield and provide Zero Fees on all swaps.  The exchange is fully decentralized at launch, has been comprehensively audited and is scheduled for launch on April 1st.

&#x200B;

**Key Features and Innovations**

* **Automatic Atomic Arbitrage (AAA):** unique within DeFi, Salty automatically executes arbitrage within user swap transactions themselves - ensuring that arbitrage profits are captured by the protocol itself rather than external bots or miners. The generated profits take the place of swap fees and are distributed to liquidity providers and stakers, allowing for Zero Fees on all swaps. The execution is hyper-efficient and uses 95k gas (less gas than simple vanilla swaps on most other DEXs).
* **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO):** At deployment, Salty.IO is governed entirely by its DAO - with all contracts, parameters, regional exclusions, whitelisting, and functionality controlled by the DAO itself.
* **SALT Token Economics:** The SALT token serves both as a utility and governance token, with a capped supply of 100 million tokens, limited emissions and deflationary mechanisms.
* **Fair Launch and Distribution Strategy:** The project avoids pre-sales or VC funding, opting for a fair launch that includes airdrops and bootstrapping rewards to encourage early participation and liquidity provision.
* **Comprehensive Auditing:** Salty.IO has been audited by Trail of Bits, ABDK, and Code4rena.

&#x200B;

**Upcoming AMA Details**

* u/danielcota, the founder of Salty.IO, dedicated the past year to meticulously designing and developing this project. He will be available in this thread on February 18th from 8-10pm (GMT+0) to answer questions. We encourage you to submit your queries in advance, and Daniel will address as many as possible during the AMA session.
* Additionally, u/aramasc4 from Code4rena will join the discussion, focusing on the security and audit aspects of Salty.IO. They will delve into how the extensive Code4rena audit process has significantly bolstered Salty.IO's security framework.

Hope you're having a Conetastic Day today! Crypto still pumping and lots of exciting things happening in our space. 

I try not to let feelings dictate how I look at these updates but it just felt like this week was an important week for a few of these tokens with some big announcements and things going on. I'll go into more detail about those at the bottom. 

Also, almost forgot to mention that I've added a new token! Per suggestion of u/CrossPuffs I added the Banano token to the tracker. I'll admit I'm not very familiar with this token or community so I'll have to be doing a deeper dive into that later but they've been included starting this week!

So without further adieu here's the data:

Data from last week 2.9.24:

https://preview.redd.it/pxqvfjk00zic1.png?width=685&format=png&auto=webp&s=5000f0b499d1fe2971c6eeec2f362a5a1f979699

Data from this morning 2.16.24:

https://preview.redd.it/b69h4dg20zic1.png?width=685&format=png&auto=webp&s=1df3e22d81e9d514ca9f1ee477b1aef33294e906

1. First thing that jumped out to me is that Cone has taken back over the top spot of that third tier. They had some huge announcements from their AMA on rCC and also from the announcement of their road map going forward that is pinned to the top of their sub. Lots of bullish news of course which has contributed to the pump and increase in sub members. If you haven't taken the time to read into that info, especially the roadmap, I would recommend doing so. 
2. Second thing is that when I was adding in Banano I had no idea where it would fall in the market cap list and I'm pretty surprised that it's above Moons and at the top of that second tier. I'll be interested to continue tracking it to see how it moves with the rest of these.
3. A couple weeks back I talked about Donut would be moving to the Arbitrum One chain and I wanted to see how that would effect things. Earlier this week they started shuttling a few of the Donuts over from Gnosis to Arbitrum. They've dropped a bit since last week but I don't think the move has been enough to show any impact of that yet. Will something I follow in the coming weeks though. Still patiently waiting on mine to get the shuttle ride haha!
4. GONE has been a bit of a surprise to see drop from last week. They've had some pretty bullish news/announcements as well. So I was expecting to see a bit of a pump but maybe it's been more of a sell the news situation instead at this point. They announced their upcoming GoneDex and are really making a push to get on a CEX.
5. Final thing I'll bring up is regarding the fourth tier here. TACO made the move again to pass Plunger but Plunger not going down without a fight. Everybody in the fourth tier picked up MC except POOP (which I think was overdue for a small correction anyways) and MIKO. I feel like every time I do these updates I'm waiting to see Plunger take the final dive off a cliff but so far it hasn't happened yet.

That's all I've got for now, thanks for taking a read. I'll do something I do with my students, if you've read down this far post the funniest meme you can find in the comments to give everyone some laughs. If you see anything I've missed or want to bring up another point please drop it in the comments as well! I appreciate you all so much!",2024-02-16,0

2968,Beginner's Guide | What is Crypto Games,0,1asb7c6,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1asb7c6/beginners_guide_what_is_crypto_games/,9,"As we navigate the intricate web of the 21st century, two dominant phenomena continue to rewrite the rules in technology and finance: cryptocurrency and gaming. 

**What is Crypto Game ?** 

Crypto games, also known as blockchain games, leverage the functionalities of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology to provide an immersive gaming experience. Unlike traditional gaming where players' data is stored on centralized servers, crypto games decentralize this data on a public ledger or blockchain.  
In these games, tokens‚Äîoften non-fungible tokens (NFTs)‚Äîare used to represent in-game assets such as avatars, weapons, lands, or even unique abilities. As a result of tokenization, these assets can be bought, sold, or traded independently of the game itself.  
Some crypto games also introduce the play-to-earn model (P2E), which allows players to earn real-world rewards by participating in gameplay actions or selling their treasured assets via various crypto exchanges.

&#x200B;

 **Why are Crypto Games gaining Popularity?**

* **Play-to-Earn Model:**  
*The P2E model shifts power from developers to players by enabling them to earn real-world value from their time spent gaming.*
* **Ownership and Control:**  
*Players have verifiable ownership of their in-game assets thanks to NFTs' unique properties.*
* **Cross-Game Compatibility:**  
*Some assets earned in one game can be used in another‚Äîthus enhancing user engagement across different gaming environments.*
* **Community Participation:**  
*Blockchain's decentralized nature allows players to contribute to decision-making processes regarding game development and management.*

&#x200B;

 **What are some blockchain/crypto games ?**

* Axie Infinity, Decentraland, My Neighbour Alice, The Sandbox,[Hero of Mavia](https://heybeluga.com/articles/heroes-of-mavia-game-review/),

&#x200B;

R**emember:**

* Crypto games involve inherent risks like market volatility and potential scams. Conduct thorough research and invest responsibly. 
* Start small and avoid investing significant amounts before understanding the gameplay and earning mechanics.
* Never share your private wallet information with anyone.

&#x200B;

TL:DR:   
Crypto games, also called blockchain games, merge cryptocurrency and gaming, storing data on decentralized ledgers like blockchain. They use tokens, often NFTs, for in-game assets, enabling buying, selling, and trading outside the game. The play-to-earn model lets players earn real rewards, and ownership is verifiable via NFTs. Popular examples include Axie Infinity, Decentraland, and Hero of Mavia. **Be cautious of risks like market volatility and scams, start small, and never share private wallet info.**
