*****
> Stock futures rose Tuesday morning after the Nasdaq Composite posted its best daily performance since July.
*****
> Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 2.13%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 506 points or 1.67% and S&P 500 futures jumped 1.88%.
*****
> Strong earnings results on Tuesday morning were adding fuel to a rally that began on Monday. Shares of Johnson & Johnson rose 1.7% in premarket trading after it beat estimates on the top and bottom lines for the third quarter. Goldman Sachs rose more than 2% after strong trading results helped the investment bank beat expectations for earnings and revenue.
*****
> Those reports continued a strong stretch of earnings, including beats from Bank of America and Bank of New York Mellon on Monday.
*****
> The Dow is coming off a strong start to the week, adding roughly 551 points on Monday. The S&P 500 also rose 2.65% for the day. The Nasdaq surged 3.43% as tech stocks rebounded, led by names such as Amazon, Meta Platforms and Microsoft. It was the best day for the tech-heavy index since July 27.
*****
> Fears of a recession and overly aggressive central banks have helped push the U.S. markets to their lows of the year in recent weeks, but the solid start to earnings season may signal that the economy is currently in better shape than feared.
*****
> “3Q and 4Q earnings should confirm fundamentals remain anchored in resilient labor market and Covid reopening. Equity valuation will likely remain tied to global central bank rhetoric and rates, which is turning incrementally less negative. As such, we see equities primed for upside into year-end on resilient 2H22 earnings, low equity positioning, very negative sentiment and given more reasonable valuation,” Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, JPMorgan’s head of global macro research, said in a note to clients.
*****
> “Next year, however, we expect a more challenging earnings backdrop relative to current expectations,” he added.

1060,"Sony cuts PlayStation 5 sales forecast to 21 million units after posting record revenue Sony cut its sales forecast for its flagship PlayStation 5 console on Wednesday, after warning of weaker transactions in its key gaming division.

The Japanese gaming giant said it now expects to sell 21 million units of the PS5 in the fiscal year ending March, down from a previous forecast of 25 million units.

The cut in outlook comes after Sony posted record quarterly revenue in the all-important December quarter which encompasses the holiday season. Sony sold 8.2 million units of its flagship PlayStation 5 console in its fiscal third quarter, which runs from October to December. Sony has sold 16.4 million PS5 units so far in its fiscal year.

Sony also trimmed its fiscal year sales forecast for the gaming division by 210 billion yen to 4.15 trillion yen, saying it expects a decrease in sales of hardware.

The company’s challenge now lies in trying to keep up momentum for the PS5, which was released more than three years ago. In October, Sony made available a refreshed version of the console with better specs.

Rival Nintendo has been grappling with a similar issue, managing to keep interest in its near seven-year old Switch console thanks to new game releases and movies associated with its famous characters, like Super Mario.

Sales at Sony’s gaming business rose 16% year-on-year to 1.4 trillion yen in the December quarter, the company said on Wednesday. However, operating profit fell 26% in the division, due to increase losses from hardware due to promotions in the period as well as a decline in sales of first-party games.

Sony also lowered its sales forecast for the entire company to 12.3 trillion yen from 12.4 trillion yen for the fiscal year.

Sony beat analyst expectations by a wide margin in its fiscal third quarter when it reported results on Wednesday.

Here’s how Sony did in the December quarter versus LSEG consensus estimates:

Revenue: 3.75 trillion Japanese yen ($24.9 billion) versus 3.58 trillion yen expected

Operating profit: 463.3 billion yen versus 428.4 billion yen expected

Sony said that it will partially spin off its financial services business via a public listing. The company plans to distribute slightly more than 80% of its shares of Sony Financial Group through dividends in kind as a result of the spinoff, in a listing due to take place in October 2025.

Sony’s financial services unit saw revenue in the December quarter rise more than 1,100% to 311.7 billion yen. The company said this was thanks to a rise in sales at its insurance business.

Sony also reported a 21% jump in sales in its image sensor business, which it sells to companies like Apple for smartphones.

Meanwhile, Sony in January scrapped a planned merger with Indian firm Zee Entertainment. The deal, which was negotiated for more than two years, was seen as a way for Sony to get a foot into the lucrative Indian entertainment market.

Hiroki Totoki, Sony’s chief financial officer, said on Wednesday that India has “great growth potential,” adding that the company will “seek various opportunities” in the country and will look into plans to “replace” the failed merger with Zee.

I am confused about how t bills work here’s a few questions I have about it:

2. How much can I make on average with t bills if I buy $29,000 worth every 3 months and  just rinsing and repeating? 

3. When using fidelity for purchasing T bills what does the expected yield mean? Is that my annualized rate assuming I reinvest for 1 year?

2. That the initial number was 45 Billion.
3. That the other 55 Billion would or could be 'released' at a rate of 1 Billion per month.

Needless to say natural Gas has tanked recently. I did not see it coming with European price cap etc. and the talk of banning gas stoves as well as warmer winters for the most part. I'm in a pickle on to cut my losses on this or just wait and hold for a demand spike later in 2023 enough to get me out with no losses on this.

2205,"For investing in pre-IPO companies, what broker are you investing with? I am with Equityzen but considering to move to another one. I am investing in pre-IPO companies with a broker Equityzen. When you invest with Equityzen, investments are usually structured as parts of a funds. In other words, Equityzen acquires shares of a pre-IPO company and converts it to a fund and sell it to retail investors. So what you own is a part of a fund that owns shares of a single pre-IPO company.

As you are a LLP (limited liability partnership), Equityzen has a sole discretion whether to participate in a tender offer (i.e., a process of pre-IPO company buying back their shares).

My problem is that Equityzen usually opts in tender offers. Although I made a handsome profit of 200% from tender offers over a couple of years, my expectation is not to step out with such early profit, but to hold them longer until IPO (or being sold to a big company) for a greater profit.

My another concern regarding tender offers is that pre-IPO companies may buy back a large number of shares before going for IPO to maximise the capital inflow. If Equityzen opts in tender offer at such stage, then a risk-to-reward ratio of my pre-IPO investment would be  damaged substantially.

So I am searching for a broker where I can directly own shares.

\- Which brokers are you investing with?

\- When a company goes for IPO (or sold to a bigger company), your broker updates you the news and advise your next step (e.g., how to sell your shares)?

\- does your broker also updates you major news or deal of the company such as tender offers or others?

Any advise would be appreciated. Thank you so much in advance for sharing your experience.

&#x200B;

EDIT: at last I am considering partially Forge (as I know only Equityzen and Forge). If anybody here is investing with Forge, please let me know your experience with this broker.

I did try to write an article about this in past, but did not have much time to write it. Today I will try to go more in depth behind my investment into Mullen Automotive. (Update) I already put a good few hours of my Saturday into this. I could continue, but I think I will stop it here. Please note that different sources share different numbers. My research is NOT financial advice, to be honest I mainly wrote it for myself to see what I am doing now when investing. Please if you like my analysis, please be sure to upvote this article or follow me.

(Update from TGS Trades) Average CTB for all existing borrowed shares = 102%
Average CTB for new borrowed shares ranges from 176% to 312%
Supporting my analysis. 




**FACTS**

Market Cap is 55.355M

Total assets 403M (went from 255M in June 2023)

Shares Outstanding is 4.13M (29.2% insiders and other companies and rest for public)

Current price is 13.40 (+5.59%), 13.3 (after maket)

*Mullen Automotive has a total shareholder equity of $351.8M and total debt of $7.3M, which brings its debt-to-equity ratio to 2.1%. Its total assets and total liabilities are $560.0M and $208.1M respectively.*

Total Cash is 214.01M - They are in debt, total debt is 7.3M, but currently quoted earnings + total cash can easily cover this. They are not going bankrupt. (what many people dont know that short term debt went down from 96M as of Dec 2023.

For last year this stock lost -99.8% of its price.

Number emplyees went 118 to 151. (Source: LinkedIn)

*It is good value based on its Price-To-Book Ratio (0.2x) compared to the US Auto industry average (1.5x).*

ROE is -300%

Mullen does not Pay Dividents

P/E -0.0043 (change -92.16% from last)

P/S 179.72 (changed from 0.2 in 2019, good is between 1-2)

**REVENUE**

They are/were unprofitable. I was able to find old income or low income (308K) in past years.

Based on recent news just in Q4 2023 it should be \~12.5M in invoices. The results should be seen in their 10K report this January.

**INVENTORY**

Like mentioned above total assets are worth in 400M. Which is quite decent change from last year (255M). 250M were for large Mishawaka plant that enables them to produce 50k vehicles per year.

**POTENTIAL GROWTH**

June 2023 - 560M, Sept 2022 - 302M (Total Assets)

308K in earnings to whooping 12.5M in just Q4 2023.

Earning dates are to be disclosed rougly around Jan 11th 2024.

Some say they will not report it for this year, I think they will as they delayed their 10K (unusual step)

Some estimate stock jumping by 57.3% growth after earnings (I expect more).

**PATTERNS**

Multiple timeframe analysis indicating steady decline up until now where we see inverse head and shoulders, changing from bearish to bullish market.

MFI increasing

EMA increasing drastically (20 above 50 moving close to 100)

Fib. Retracement from Oct 2023 indicating that we would break resistance break resistance 0.236 and settle at \~50% gains unless we break 18-20 levels as well.

MACD strategy showing Buy and Hold equity increasing last day (above normal the other days)

I am expecting bullish penant (short term retrace is supported by high RSI), but after that breaking those 14 levels stopping at 18-20 levels and above those levels after 10K report.

**RISKS**

Stock split - David Michery after the compliance. (Possible)

8864,"$YELLQ - Revising my (future) PPS estimate of Yellow Corporation's stock (YELLQ) to roughly $18/sh, with medium confidence pushing into the low 20s... After some number crunching sessions using updated details, I've decided to revise my (future) PPS estimate of YELLQ (Yellow Corporation) to roughly $18/sh - with medium confidence pushing into the low 20s.  I expect the company to end up with just shy of $1 Billion in excess proceeds from asset sales, which will later be paid out to existing holders of YELLQ's 52,128,887 shares of common stock (based on % owned).  \*This is after all ""allowed"" secured/unsecured creditor claims have been paid.  The real wildcard is Yellow's outstanding lawsuit against the Teamsters' labor union.  Additional settlement proceeds from that litigation could actually drive this price-per-share estimate much higher, but those details are too unknown right now to make predictions on.  However, it's promising and the company has a strong legal case against the IBT.

&#x200B;

WARN Act claim payouts will not be an issue given the rapid/unexpected deterioration of Yellow Corp's business in July 2023, and other related details.  Also, multiple bankruptcy experts have stated that the company will owe/pay a very small % (if any) towards the Central States Pension Fund ""claims"" - which initially totaled $5B+.  Numerous followers have pointed this out w/ an assumption that it will eat up all shareholder proceeds...which would include LARGE common stock investments from (at least) 3 hedge funds and the U.S. Government.  In my opinion, the CSPF situation is low risk given numerous released details and a strong legal objection from the company.  Assessing that final number paid out will be between $0-$100M.  We'll know much more over the next 60 days.  Happy New Year!"

So, let's talk about a piece of news from the USA. The Biden administration is thinking about the idea of increasing tariffs on some Chinese goods, and that includes electric vehicles (EVs). The goal here is to deal with worries about depending too much on Asia's biggest economy and to safeguard our own industries.

A group of U.S. lawmakers, made up of both Democrats and Republicans, is also showing interest in encouraging the administration to raise tariffs on cars made in China. However, the nitty-gritty details of these tariff changes, like which products will be affected and how much the increases will be, are still being thought about.

It's a bit like the government is considering adjusting the costs of certain things from China, especially electric cars, to make sure we're not relying too heavily on another country and to protect businesses in our own land. Let's keep an eye on how this all unfolds!"

939,"Reddit files to list IPO on NYSE under the ticker RDDT Social media company Reddit filed its IPO prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday after a yearslong run-up. The company plans to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “RDDT.”

Its market debut, expected in March, will mark the first major tech initial public offering of the year. It’s the first social media IPO since Pinterest went public in 2019.

Reddit first filed a confidential draft of its public offering prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission in December 2021.

The social media company, founded in 2005 by technology entrepreneurs Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman, has raised about $1.3 billion in funding and has a post valuation of $10 billion, according to deal-tracking service PitchBook.

Publishing giant Condé Nast bought Reddit in 2006 and then spun it out as an independent company in 2011.

As of October, Reddit had 70 million daily active users and over 100,000 active communities, or subreddits, according to its corporate website. Reddit is one of the most-visited websites in the U.S., according to analytics firm Semrush, but it has struggled to build an online advertising business comparable to tech giants like Facebook-parent Meta and Google-parent Alphabet.

It’s also faced challenges with developers and moderators.

In June, several prominent Reddit moderators locked subreddits as part of a blackout to protest the company’s decision to increase the price third-party developers pay to use its application programming interface, or API. At the time, Reddit said the pricing change was necessary because many big tech companies were using data to train large language models.

I haven't had this problem before I was lucky enough to make nice profit off some in the first few months and I let the ones that were not profitable just sit for last 2 years, bad idea for some of these garbage stocks, live and learn."

1910,"What's the role and future of Intel in Taiwan's geopolitical scenario? I don't know why but this topic has intrigued me a lot lately. So I'll start by saying that I'm a complete rookie on this. With this post, I merely intend to throw my thoughts out there to be challenged so I can learn from you guys.

From a geopolitical point of view, Intel strikes me as the ideal solution to the West. But their stubbornness over the last two decades has been a huge disappointment for the industry. Delays, reduced reliability, unfulfilled promises, and an overall loss of trust from pretty much everyone. If I'm not mistaken, that has been the consequence of poor management and the refusal to explore either fabless chip design or to spin out the Fab as a service business.

From what I've been reading, Nvidia and AMD have managed to get better chips, not because they have been better at designing them, but because the increased efficiencies of TSMC allowed them to go for lower nm.

If I understand this correctly, TSMC managed to get more efficient than Intel at manufacturing chips mostly for a couple of reasons: Taiwan's government subsidies and economies of scale. Functioning as a service that fabless chip designers could use to produce their chips has caused TSMC to engage in *a lot* more volume of chip manufacturing, as it's logical. That allows the economies of scale to kick in and make the processes more efficient. That paired with huge government support has the manufacturing at TSMC substantially more efficient than the one at Intel.

Now TSMC is 100% based in Taiwan, which is a geopolitical ticking bomb. And everyone is now scrambling to diversify their way as far away from China and Taiwan as they can. I guess the Chips Act is the most obvious move from the US government in that direction. This is prompting Samsung and TSMC to invest in opening new fabs in the US. Europe seems to be in a similar direction, but perhaps with milder strokes.

[I'm reading](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/165c0mq/they_would_not_listen_to_us_inside_arizonas/) that TSMC is struggling to replicate its way of doing business in the US. That should pose a problem to the political move the Chips Act intended.

But I haven't mentioned Intel. They have experience in opening and managing fabs on American soil. They have obvious support from the American government and they have now embraced the idea of offering their fabbing services to fabless chip designers - which from my understanding should make their processes substantially more competitive.

Now my conclusion of this whole thing is that Intel's success at spinning out new fabs that benefit from economies of scale is the key to this whole geopolitical knot. Maybe Samsung is another key player in this? I can sense there's *a lot* I'm not understanding or missing but I can't point my finger at what is it. Maybe someone over here can educate me a bit."

260,"AMKOR – AMKR – Is an absolute bargain at today’s price and is an AI boom stock for the future   

Let’s face it – this AI boom isn’t going away any time soon. I say this as a guy who had decided entirely that he missed the NVDA train, then proceeded to YOLO a $700 call right before close yesterday (then panic sell it for a $2500 win, but $2300 less than I could have sold it for if I held it a mere 20 minutes longer), I’m officially convinced that AI is the next mega growth space in the market. 

AI requires chips. NVDA has somewhere in the neighborhood of 90% of the market of these GPU’s, something that doesn’t appear will be challenged in the immediate future. While many of the other major tech players have decided they are going to enter the space – this isn’t a process that happens particularly quickly, and I think it is reasonable to expect that NVDA’s dominance in this space should continue for at least the next couple of years. 

The US has a desperate need for independence in the semiconductor space, and AMKOR is a company that will help take us there. 

The pandemic was an absolute screaming example of why we need more control over the chip supply chain – as chip shortages caused supply chain debacles that brought many electronic industries to a halt (the auto industry as well). The resulting inflation created by this issue (among any other issues) was pronounced enough that Biden initiated what I believe to be the most important and prominent success of his administration thus far – the CHIPS and Science act – pledging to give something like $39 billion in grants/incentives to US based across the supply chain to bolster domestic production capabilities. 

Once a chip is manufactured, or at least the ones required for AI tasks, they are required to be packaged via a process called CoWoS – or Chip on Wafer on Substrate. This process is fairly complex, and there aren’t many companies worldwide that are able to package this way currently. Contrary to popular believe – the “Chips Shortgage” that we have faced in recent years isn’t actually a shortage of chips – but rather the inability to package chips using CoWoS quick enough to keep up with the absolutely insane demand.

TSMC – Taiwain Semiconductor Manufacturing Company – is far and away the largest current packager for CoWoS chips (they actually manufacture NVDA chips as well, but that’s an entirely different wall of text all together. NVDA has actually built a moat of sorts around the GPU chip industry). However – there are several major problems with NVDA’s reliance on TSMC for chip packaging. 

* TSMC cannot currently keep up with the demand. Not even close. This was reiterated by their chairman as recently as September, and he has stated it will be several years before they can keep up with the NVDA CoWoS needs. 
* Even if TSMC could keep up with NVDA’s needs (they can’t) – there are tons of other major players entering this space that have a need for CoWoS packaging – which will further create demand for more packaging facilities. 
* TSMC currently manufacture all almost all their chips in Taiwan. While they have agreed to new plants in Germany, Japan, China, and the United States, Taiwan’s national security considerations (and the US’ interest in this as well) mean they will likely continue to manufacture their most advanced chips in Taiwan. They’ve actually had to get approval from the US government to manufacture/package their less advanced chips at their two facilities in China. 
* TSMC will always have the imminent threat of action that China decides to take. This is likely as big of a catalyst for the Chips Act as the supply chain shortages were. The US doesn’t want to be reliant on what China decides to do or not do in regards to Taiwan when it comes to our chips. 

All of these items leave a massive opportunity for new players to enter the space, and I believe AMKOR will be a major player that fills that role in the future. 

There are many reasons why I’m bullish on AMKR specifically, but I’ve outlined a few of the major reasons below. 

* AMKR is the only US based company currently that has the ability to package CoWoS chips. The Biden administration has repeatedly stated again and again how important it is for the US to have the ability to package chips domestically. 
* AMKR is 55 years old. They have stood the test of time. They aren’t some brand-new start up that is entirely dependent on debt or issuing massive amounts of new shares to fund their growth. 
* AMKR actually pays a dividend making it attractive to boomers as well. It’s dividends have also purely been covered by free cash flow – amounting to just 18% of its free cash flow last year. They have also increased this dividend by 25 % each year on average. 
* AMKR liabilities have been decreasing every year as a percent of their assets. 
* AMKR has a strong balance sheet, with free cash continuing to grow every year. 
* AMKR has started development of a massive manufacturing and packaging facility in Peoria, Arizona – building a $2bb plant there that will have 500k sq ft of ‘clean room space.’
* AMKR expanded their already existing partnership with Apple for Chip packaging in November. Apple has already pledged to be the first and largest customer of said plant. Through this partnership, Apple has already worked extensively on the strategic vision and manufacturing capabilities for said facility in Peoria. 
* AMKR has applied for a grant from the Chips act to develop said facility. I believe they will get said grant. 
   * a. As I mentioned previously, they are currently the only US company with CoWoS capability. This is important to the Biden administration. 
   * b. James Joo-Jin Kim (whose family founded AMKR, and who are the largest shareholders currently), have a lot of ties to Penn. Biden has a lot of ties to Penn. While I haven’t found any direct relationship between the two, I would like to believe that if Biden has an leverage on where these grants are dispersed, AMKR is ‘likable’ in this sense. 
* AMKR’s current market cap is only $7bb. Plenty of room for this baby to run, especially given its segment. 
* And finally, best for last, AMKR surged in June upon rumors that NVDA was directly helping AMKR with packaging solutions for CoWoS AI Chips. Amkor 2.5D chip packaging nearly doubled from 3,000 wafers monthly in early 2023, to 5,000 by year end, and projections of 7,000 by end of 2024. 80% of these are for NVDA. 

That’s all I have for today. I’ve burned 1.5 hours of my work day typing this out. I am normally an “invest in the 401k,” day trade lotto plays type of guys. For the foreseeable future, I intend on acquiring more and more shares of AMKR stock, and continuing to buy Options as far out in the future as I can – currently stacking the 09/20 $35 Calls. My hope is that AMKR will get increased attention through a grant from the CHIPS act, production beginning on their new facility, an official partnership with NVDA, and reports of increased chip packaging production, leaps will open up that I can begin acquiring as well. 

TL:DR – AI Stocks go rocketship boooom. AMKR has yet to truly lift off. Plenty of catalysts to send it to the moon. "

1750,"Seeking Insights: Apartment Building vs. Strip Mall Investment in Suburban Growth Area I'm contemplating between two real estate investments: a 30-50-unit apartment building at $1,500 rent per unit or a strip mall with 7-12 units, leasing at $15-20/sqft/year for 2,000 sqft spaces. The location is a suburban area near a metropolitan hub, with a growing population.  
I'm looking for your wisdom on a few fronts:  
Profitability: Which type of investment has shown better returns in similar markets? Considerations include construction costs, operating expenses, and income potential.  
Experiences: If you've tackled similar projects, what challenges did you face, and what strategies led to success?  
Market and Location: How do local conditions sway your choice between residential and commercial real estate? What location characteristics are key for success?  
Financing and Taxes: Any advice on handling financing terms and tax implications for such investments?  
I am currently leaning towards the apartment building, because it just feels like a safer option for some reason. Even though the population ere is growing, I will often see stores with for lease signs in the windows and many open spaces. The way I see it, the demand for housing is always there whereas there is probably a limit to the number fo successful shopping areas within a county.

# **Dow closes more than 300 points lower, posts worst week since June as Silicon Valley Bank collapse sparks selloff: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/09/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)**
*****
> Stocks tumbled Friday as tech-focused lender Silicon Valley Bank shut down following losses in its bond portfolio, prompting the biggest bank failure since the global financial crisis and sending shockwaves through the banking sector.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped for a fourth consecutive day, finishing 345.22 points lower, or 1.07%, to close at 31,909.64. The S&P 500 lost 1.45% to settle at 3,861.59. The Nasdaq Composite shed 1.76% to end at 11,138.89.
*****
> All the major averages capped off the week with losses. The Dow fell 4.44% to post its worst weekly performance since June. The S&P dropped 4.55%, while the Nasdaq lost 4.71%.
*****
> Regulators took control of Silicon Valley Bank on Friday, after shares tumbled Thursday and the bank struggled on Friday to find another company to buy it. Regional bank stocks tumbled in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank’s demise, with the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF lost nearly 4.4%. For the week, the regional bank fund lost about 16%, its worst week since March 2020 as the pandemic hit.
*****
> “You had a major U.S. bank collapse, the biggest bank failure since 2008, inevitably that’s going to spook the market,” said Sylvia Jablonski, CEO and chief investment officer of Defiance ETFs. The failure, she added, is also fueling concern among investors over whether the contagion spreads beyond SVB.
*****
> Several bank stocks were repeatedly halted on Friday, including First Republic, PacWest and crypto-focused Signature Bank. First Republic dropped 14.8%, and PacWest shed 37.9%. Some bellwether bank stocks suffered smaller losses even as SVB’s fallout wreaked havoc on regional names. Goldman Sachs and Bank of America fell 4.2% and 0.9% respectively. JPMorgan held onto a 2.5% gain.
*****
> “This is gamebook play, where traders and shorter term investors don’t want to be long over the weekend,” said Rich Steinberg, chief market strategist at The Colony Group.
*****
> The turmoil among bank stocks overshadowed a February jobs report, which gave some hints that inflation could be slowing. Payrolls increased more than expected, but investors focused on the smaller-than-expected gain in wages, which may cause the Federal Reserve to rethink its aggressive stance on rate hikes.

> # Payrolls Strong but Unemployment Rises: All Mixed Up

> Another month, another solid employment report. Employment rose by 311,000 in February, on the back of 504,000 in January and 239,000 in December. It’s certainly been a warm winter. This is the labor market that refuses to give in, despite the Fed throwing almost 500 bps (5%-points) of rate hikes at it and gearing up for more.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-10-payrolls-1202x1600.png))**

> # But the unemployment rate rose …
> Yes, the unemployment rate rose to 3.6%, up from 3.4% in January. However, that was entirely for positive reasons.

> The unemployment rate, as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) measures it, is the number of people unemployed who are looking for work divided by the size of the labor force. Last month, the number of unemployed people that are looking for work rose by about 240,000. However, that’s because 419,000 people “entered” the labor force, i.e., started looking for work. That’s a sign of a healthy labor market. People will start looking for work only if they think they can get a job.

> The labor force measure has issues related to how participation is measured – they count someone as being in the labor force only if someone is looking for work. But a lot of people may not do so for any number of reasons, including not feeling confident in the job market or non-economic reasons like not having access to childcare. The measure also can fall over time because of a lot of retiring baby-boomers.

> One way to get around these issues is to look at the employment-population ratio for prime age workers, i.e., workers aged 25-54 years. This measures the number of people working as a percent of the civilian population – think of it as the opposite of the unemployment rate, and because we use prime age, you get around the demographic issue as well.

> The good news is that the prime-age employment-population ratio just hit 80.5%, which is close to the highest level we’ve seen in a couple of decades.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-10-e-pop-ratio-1203x1600.png))**

> It helps to recall that we just had a multi-generational black swan event in the form of a pandemic. But once everything re-opened, the expectation was that things would bounce back immediately. And a lot of numbers did, including GDP, employment, and consumption.

> However, there were also a lot of people who left the labor force amid the pandemic. And what we’re seeing now is that each month there’s a continuous flow of people back into the labor force, and these people are finding jobs quickly. Just over the past six months, 1.5 million more people have come into the labor force as prospects for finding a job improve.

> Make no mistake, this is a really strong labor market in my opinion.

> # Is the labor market too strong?
> It’s weird to even ask that question, but it matters for the Federal Reserve. In their model for the economy, they see a tight labor market as one that results in stronger wage growth. And strong wage growth can drive demand higher, pushing up prices and inflation.

> Well, hopefully, they can rest a little easy on that front. Average hourly earnings rose just 0.2% in February. Over the past three months, wages have been growing at an annualized pace of 3.6%, well below the 6%+ pace we saw last year. It’s getting very close to the pre-pandemic pace of 3.1%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-10-ahe-3m-change-1212x1600.png))**

> This backs up other evidence that wage growth is indeed easing, including the Employment Cost Index, which is the gold standard of wage growth measures. The ECI was running at an annualized pace of 4.2% in Q4 2022, down from 4.8% in Q3. The January-February hourly earnings data suggest that wage growth continues to decelerate.

> The big question is whether the Fed buys this. Powell’s comments this week in front of Congress did not inspire confidence. It looks like a string of hot economic data has left them questioning their decision to ease the pace of rate increases from 50 bps to 25 bps (as of February) – and wondering if they should move that back up to 50 bps at their March meeting. At this point, markets think the outcome is a coin toss, which is not great as Powell simply injected maximum uncertainty into markets.

> But looking beyond the Fed’s March meeting, the big picture is that the labor market appears to remain really strong. This means the economy also remains strong, and that’s not a bad thing as far as markets are concerned. Though it also means the Fed is likely to keep interest rates higher for longer.

*****

> # Panic! At the Fed?

> Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s comments this week during his semi-annual testimony in front of Congress did not inspire much confidence with respect to the path for monetary policy. It seems like Fed officials’ are confused as to what they want to do next.

> Case in point: last month, Powell said that the “disinflationary process has started.”

> Since then, we’ve had a run of strong economic data, including January payrolls, retail sales, and inflation. And it looks like that was enough to spook the Fed. The shift was clear in Powell’s statements this week:

> “Inflationary pressures are running higher than expected at the time of our previous Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.”

> And

> “The ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated.”

> At the same time, he also said:

> “If – and I stress that no decision has been made on this — if the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes.”

> Markets were clearly taken aback by his comments, with equities falling 1.5% on Tuesday (March 7th) and rate hike expectations rising.

> This becomes clear if you look at expectations for their March meeting. Last Friday, markets were expecting a 0.25% increase in the federal funds rate, pricing the probability of that at 72%.

> That’s shifted significantly since Powell’s comments this week. Investors moved the probability of a 0.25% increase down to 28%, and the probability of a 0.50% increase rose to almost 80%.

> This is a huge shift, especially this close to a meeting. Typically, the couple of weeks prior to the meeting is a “quiet period,” where Fed officials don’t give speeches or comments, i.e., anything that may lead to a shift in expectations. The last time this happened was in June 2022, when the Wall Street Journal reported that the Fed was considering raising rates by 0.75% instead of the 0.50% they guided markets toward.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-09-March-rate-hike-expectations-1202x1600.png))**

> # There’s not much reason to panic
> To be clear, the January data was hotter than expected. But this is just one month of data and is likely a rebound from the relatively soft December data (which, at the time, led to increased recession calls) and perhaps positive weather-related effects.

> We’re yet to get February data, but it’s hard to believe the string of hot data continues into February and March.

> Take vehicle sales, for example. Sales surged 19% in January to a 15.9 million annualized pace, the highest since May 2021. But sales pulled back to 14.9 million in February. So the trend is still positive, but nothing suggests that the economy is overheating to the extent that the Fed has to up-end market expectations for upcoming policy.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-09-auto-sales.png))**

> The Carson Investment Research team has been in the camp that the economy will avoid a recession this year. As we’ve discussed before, we believe consumers are in good shape, and real incomes are rising, which should keep consumption humming along.

> This gets to the point that we don’t see the Fed cutting rates any time soon. Expectations for the terminal rate, i.e., the highest rate the Fed will get to, also rose this week. At the beginning of the year, investors expected the terminal rate to end up around 4.9%. That’s now increased to about 5.6% on the back of strong economic data.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-09-rate-expectations-1202x1600.png))**

> The good news is that, at the end of the day, positive economic data is positive. This perhaps explains why equities have remained resilient this year. The S&P 500 is up just under 4% year-to-date, despite rate expectations repricing higher.

> That’s a big shift from last year and a positive one. And we believe equities have the potential to remain resilient, even as the economic data (and the Fed) swing back and forth.

*****

> # This Doesn't Happen Often

> After a surge earlier this week that took the yield on the two-year US Treasury up above 5% for the first time since 2007, concerns over the health of bank balance sheets have caused a sharp reversal lower. From a closing high of 5.07% on Wednesday, the yield on the two-year US Treasury has plummeted to 4.62% and is on pace for its largest two-day decline since September 2008. Remember that?

> A 45 basis point (bps) two-day decline in the two-year yield has been extremely uncommon over the last 46 years. Of the 79 prior occurrences, two-thirds occurred during recessions, and the only times that a move of this magnitude did not occur either within six months before or after a recession were during the crash of 1987 (10/19 and 10/20) as well as 10/13/89 when the leveraged buyout of United Airlines fell through, resulting in a collapse of the junk bond market. As you can see from the New York Times headline the day after that 1989 plunge, just as investors are worrying today over whether we're in for a repeat of the Financial Crisis, back then they were looking at 'troubling similarities' to the 1987 crash. The year that followed the October 1989 decline wasn't a particularly positive period for equities, but a repeat of anything close to the 1987 crash never materialized.

> # 50-DMAs Couldn't Hold

> Worries about banks today left major US index ETFs across the market cap spectrum back below their 50-day moving averages. The uptrend channels that have been formed over the last six months are also getting tested with this week's move lower. You can see the current set-ups in the snapshot from our Chart Scanner tool below.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/50days.png))**

> Looking at our Trend Analyzer, every sector ETF except for Technology has now moved back below its 50-day moving average. Six of eleven sectors are actually oversold (>1 standard deviation below 50-DMA), with Financials (XLF) and Health Care (XLV) at ""extreme oversold"" levels. XLF had been up more than 8% on the year about a month ago, but it's now down 1.93% YTD.

> Technology (XLK) and Utilities (XLU) are the only two sectors up over the last week. Interestingly, Utilities (XLU) has been one of the worst performing sectors so far this year, while Tech has been the best.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/ussectoretfs.png))**

> With Financials seeing such a sharp decline this week, below is a snapshot of various banks and brokers in the sector with the ones highlighted in red all now trading at least 5% below their 50-DMA. As shown, Charles Schwab (SCHW) is down the most over the last week with a decline of 12.6%, which has left it 16.4% below its 50-DMA and down nearly 20% on the year. Other names like Bank of America (BAC), JP Morgan (JPM), and Raymond James (RJF) are in extreme oversold territory as well. Of the major banks and brokers listed, Goldman Sachs (GS) has actually held up the best over the last week with a decline of just 2%.

> # Bearish Sentiment Remains

> The S&P 500's swings higher and then lower over the past week have left sentiment little changed. For the American Association of Individual Investors' (AAII) weekly survey, 24.8% of respondents reporting as bullish compared to 23.4% the previous week. That is the second higher reading in a row but still well below the recent high of 37.5% from one month ago.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/030923-AAII-1.png))**

> Along with a modest bounce in bullishness, bearish sentiment has taken a modest decline falling from a recent high of 44.8% last week down to 41.7% today. That is the first decline in a month, leaving it in the middle of its range since the start of last year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/030923-AAII-2.png))**

> Given the moves in bullish and bearish sentiment, the bull-bear spread remains skewed in favor of bears for the third week in a row.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/030923-AAII-3.png))**

> Following a sharp eight percentage point decline last week, neutral sentiment has bounced rising to 33.4%. Albeit higher, outside of last week, that reading would be the lowest since the end of 2022.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/030923-AAII-4.png))**

> Although recent weeks have seen the AAII survey return to deeply bearish sentiment, other surveys are not nearly as pessimistic. While the AAII survey's bull-bear spread sits well over a standard deviation below its historical average, the NAAIM Exposure index continues to show only modestly long positioning among active managers. Currently, that reading is 0.2 standard deviations below the historical norm. Meanwhile, the weekly Investors Intelligence survey is actually showing respondents are reporting as more bullish than has been historically normal.

> # A Closer Look at Seasonality

> We talked a lot about how February (especially the second half of February) could be a potential break for stocks, well the good news is that we now see many signs of better times potentially coming soon.

> Here’s what the average year for the S&P 500 looks like. Looking at the chart below, the blue line shows gains from January through April, and November and December are normal. It is the middle part of the year that stocks tend to struggle.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blog-164.png))**

> Lately, things look a little different. Looking at only the past 20 years showed that stocks tended to bottom in March. This is likely due to major bear market lows taking place during this month in 2003, 2009, and 2020.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blog-273.jpg))**

> We’ve shared before that pre-election years tend to be strong for stocks, lower only twice going back to World War II and up nearly 17% on average, making this historically the strongest year of the 4-year Presidential cycle. Looking at these years it is once again common to see the second half of February weakness and a tradeable low in late February.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blog-321.jpg))**

> Building on this, we found that pre-election years of a new President do even better, up close to 20% on average. But wouldn’t you know it, right about now tended to be a consolidation period before late March and April strength.

> What about years that started off with big gains? When stocks gained more than 5% in January (like 2023) we found that a consolidation period took place now and into April. The good news is that eventual gains of close to 23% on average were how things ended up, suggesting any potential consolidation here could potentially be used as an opportunity.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blog-599.png))**

> Lastly, I’ve seen other places combine many of the things I’ve just discussed and make one composite combining them all. I did that and we called it the Carson Cycle Composite. This proprietary composite looks at the average year, pre-election years, pre-election years under a new President, the past 20 years, and years that had a 5% January. As you can see, this year started off stronger, but as of early March is right in line with what the average composite looks like. Take note, a gain of 15.6% is what has been the average Carson Cycle Composite.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blog-640.png))**

> The bottom line is many cycles suggest the potential for some type of a consolidation here and now would be perfectly normal, but the likelihood of strength before the end of the year is quite strong.

2706,"RNDR on CEXs  I'm vaguely aware of the transition from RNDR on Ethereum to RENDER on Solana, and seemingly the RNDR token will be phased out. However, RNDR still seems to be traded on CEXs and most recently had a nice pump. As far as I can tell, most if not all major CEXs have yet to convert their RNDR or even trade RENDER at all, and no plans to convert have been announced. But isn't this token going to be worthless eventually? Is this being traded purely on speculation at this point? What's going on?

I'm bullish on Render but is there a point to holding the old token anymore?"

1206,"Should I take VOO’s price into consideration? I really want to invest in VOO but the price makes have second thought.

I am fine to save $1000 per month and invest in the etf, but in the past ten years, the price has surged from $168.88 to $452.62. And maybe after 15 years from now, the price will reach the threshold of $1000. By that time, I am afraid it will be too expensive for me to invest in. SPLG seems to be more affordable, but the market size is too small compared to likes, such as VOO, IVV and SPY, so it makes me feel insecure about it.

And then, another question. I understand the price of VOO follows the performance of S&P500 index, but still it’s traded by people worldwide, how come the price was so stable? If someone want to buy 1 million worth of the etf, why it won’t make the price volatile? 

When it will ever go up it $1000 and limit the access to fewer people, how can the price still stay with the trend? I know it still will, but how?"

Recently, at CES 2024, Richtech announced significant advancements in ADAM's AI capabilities. These improvements are expected to enable ADAM to conduct more complex conversations and replicate human-like actions more accurately. The aim here is to enhance customer interactions and improve operational efficiency in hospitality settings.

# [Dow futures down slightly after erasing earlier losses amid Russia-Ukraine tensions](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/21/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
> Stock futures fell slightly Tuesday morning, reversing much sharper declines earlier, as traders monitor brewing tensions between Russia and Ukraine.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down by 60 points or 0.17%. S&P 500 futures were off just 0.05%, and Nasdaq 100 futures slipped by 0.5%. The U.S. stock market was closed Monday due to the President’s Day holiday.
*****
> All of the declines were well off their overnight lows that saw Dow futures down more than 500 points.
*****
> Oil prices rose, with West Texas Intermediate futures jumping 4.5% to $95.19 per barrel.
*****
> Russian President Vladimir Putin said Monday that he would recognize the independence of two breakaway regions in Ukraine, potentially undercutting peace talks with President Joe Biden. That announcement was followed by news that Biden was set to order sanctions on separatist regions of Ukraine, with the European Union vowing to take additional measures.
*****
> Putin later ordered forces into the two breakaway regions.
*****
> U.K. Health Minister Sajid Javid said Tuesday that “the invasion of Ukraine has begun.” U.S. President Joe Biden has not yet used the word “invasion” to describe the current activity. The nation has also started targeted economic sanctions against five Russian banks and three wealthy individuals.
*****
> The news came after the White House said Sunday that Biden has accepted “in principle” to meet with Putin in yet another effort to deescalate the Russia-Ukraine situation via diplomacy. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the summit between the two leaders would occur after a meeting between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov.
*****
> The Russia-Ukraine conflict has put pressure on market sentiment recently, with the major averages posting back-to-back weekly losses. The Dow fell 1.9% last week, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite slid 1.6% and 1.8%, respectively.
*****
> “While Monday’s episode will have important implications for Russia’s political relations with foreign partners, a significant market event is likely avoided for the time being, but the trajectory in the coming weeks will be important to monitor from a rising market risk perspective,” said Ed Mills of Raymond James.
*****
> In early earnings action, Home Depot reported quarterly profit of $3.21 a share, three cents better than estimates, and said it sees earnings and revenue growth this year. Shares rose 1.4% in premarket trading.
*****
> Macy’s popped more than 7% in premarket trading after beating on the top and bottom lines of its quarterly results. Macy’s also authorized a new $2 billion share buyback program and announced a 5% dividend increase
*****
> In deal news, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt shares surged 14.4% after the company said it would be taken private by Veritas Capital in a deal worth $21 a share, representing a nearly 16% premium from Friday’s close. The deal is expected to be completed in the second quarter.
*****
> Traders are also keeping an eye on the Federal Reserve, as the U.S. central bank is expected to raise rates multiple times starting next month. Traders are betting that there is a 100% chance of a Fed rate hike after the March 15-16 meeting, with expectations tilting toward a 0.25 percentage point move, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool.
*****
> Expectations of tighter monetary policy have put pressure on stocks, particularly those in rate-sensitive sectors like tech, and have sent Treasury yield sharply higher to start 2022. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield ended last week around 1.93% after briefly breaking above 2%. The 10-year began 2022 trading at around 1.51%.
*****
> “All eyes are on the Fed,” Strategas investment strategist Ryan Grabinski wrote in a note released Friday evening. “As of today, the market is expecting the Fed to raise interest rates at nearly every meeting this year. Despite that, we left Monetary Policy as Favorable for now because the Fed is continuing to purchase Treasuries (an accommodative policy action).”
*****
> Meanwhile, Wall Street is preparing for the tail-end of the corporate earnings season, with Home Depot and eBay among the companies set to report this week. It has been a solid earnings season thus far: Of the more than 400 S&P 500 companies that have posted fourth-quarter earnings, 77.7% have beaten analyst expectations, according to FactSet.

Everyone is getting more sick and obese in US honestly so hospital business should doing nicely. Healthcare workers are doing 12 hour shifts and they want comfortable clothing. One emergency room doctor said all of his colleagues wear Figs so he is buying the stock. Semrush data (yes I know its not exact) shows a nice increase in visits to their website. At $6.80 I think it can go to $8 on good earnings and guidance.

Short BYND Nov 9

This brand only caters to 1 type of person - 'junk food vegans'. Vegans who eat for health know this stuff is cheap and full of crappy oxidative oils, they would opt for a burger made from nuts, seeds and veggies. Omnivores won't touch it because they can buy even grass fed ground meat at half the price. This stock should be in the single digits. Semrush visits are down which doesn't mean much since people are not buying on their website but less people are looking into the company.

https://preview.redd.it/jbyqomjn97gc1.jpg?width=241&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0a4eb496b1c32be9f2d349325d8e67b2ca1978ac

Alaska Energy Metals Corp. Jan. 30 provided a recap of a busy first year of business and an outlook for its 2024 plans at the Nikolai nickel-cobalt-copper-platinum group metals project in Alaska.

&#x200B;

[Core from EZ-23-005, a 2023 Eureka Zone hole that cut 356.2 meters averaging 0.22&#37; nickel, 0.08&#37; copper, 0.02&#37; cobalt, 0.122 g\/t palladium, 0.057 g\/t platinum, and 0.014 g\/t gold.](https://preview.redd.it/ql2dc8zw97gc1.jpg?width=425&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b4c3e69858b58753c700b4284819f68f5cd98eda)

Drawing on CEO Greg Beischer's nickel exploration background, the management of Millrock Resources Inc. decided to set aside the project generator mineral exploration model and refocus the company on exploring large deposits of nickel and associated metals needed for the transition to low-carbon energy.

As a result, Millrock rebranded as Alaska Energy Metals in April of last year and began exploration of Nikolai, a highly prospective nickel project that Beischer is very familiar with due to his involvement in its discovery while working as a lead geologist for Inco in the 1990s.

While Inco's exploration did not turn up the large deposit of nickel massive sulfides it was seeking, the exploration did discover what is turning out to be an enormous trend of disseminated sulfides enriched in nickel, cobalt, copper, and PGMs needed for lithium-ion batteries and other clean energy technologies.

Immediately upon its formation, Alaska Energy began demonstrating that the Eureka Zone on its flagship Nikolai project was indeed a large deposit of disseminated nickel sulfides enriched with cobalt, copper, and PGM byproducts. At the same time, the company resumed the hunt for higher-grade massive sulfide nickel mineralization across the 23,361-acre (9,454 hectares) project about 80 miles (130 kilometers) southeast of Delta Junction, Alaska.

""I am very proud of what we have accomplished in just 10 months. We've successfully rebranded and recapitalized the company; no small feat given challenging market conditions,"" said Beischer.

The company's first year of success was aided significantly by its C$2 million (US$1.5 million) investment to purchase a well-kept and organized database from roughly C$30 million of exploration carried out since Beischer first explored the Nikolai property in 1995.

This dataset contained enough drill information to calculate an NI 43-101-compliant resource for Eureka Zone.

According to the inaugural calculation, two relatively small open pit deposits along the much longer Eureka Zone trend host 319.6 million metric tons of inferred resource averaging 0.22% (1.55 billion lb) nickel, 0.02% (115 million lb) cobalt, 0.05% (372 million lb) copper, and 0.13 grams per metric ton (1.34 million ounces) palladium-platinum-gold.

Alaska Energy is already having this resource updated to include the eight holes it drilled last year, all of which hit 200- to 300-meter intercepts with grades very similar to the resource.

Highlights from the 2023 Eureka Zone drilling include:

• 341.6 meters averaging 0.23% nickel, 0.08% copper, 0.02% cobalt, 0.107 g/t palladium, 0.051 g/t platinum, and 0.011 g/t gold in hole EZ-23-001.

• 296.6 meters averaging 0.23% nickel, 0.09% copper, 0.02% cobalt, 0.115 g/t palladium, 0.052 g/t platinum, and 0.013 g/t gold in hole EZ-23-002.

• 324.6 meters averaging 0.23% nickel, 0.08% copper, 0.02% cobalt, 0.119 g/t palladium, 0.053 g/t platinum, and 0.011 g/t gold in hole EZ-23-003.

• 317.2 meters averaging 0.23% nickel, 0.08% copper, 0.02% cobalt, 0.109 g/t palladium, 0.049 g/t platinum, and 0.012 g/t gold in EZ-23-004.

• 356.2 meters averaging 0.22% nickel, 0.08% copper, 0.02% cobalt, 0.122 g/t palladium, 0.057 g/t platinum, and 0.014 g/t gold in hole EZ-23-005.

In addition to supporting an updated resource estimate, samples from the 2023 drilling have been submitted for deportment studies to identify what minerals the metals are found in, which will be followed by bench-scale floatation tests to determine recovery rates for the metals.

&#x200B;

[Click on image for larger map of Eureka Zone resource pits, along with historical and 2023 holes drilled at the Nikolai nickel-cobalt-copper-platinum group metals project in Alaska.](https://preview.redd.it/nvu0c19z97gc1.jpg?width=425&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e44031e4be3dabdeb60d56a66786356123a6696d)

The deportment studies are slated for completion by the end of March, and the initial floatation studies by mid-year.

""With all our 2023 drill results now in hand, we will soon publish an updated mineral resource estimate for the Eureka Zone and will receive bench-scale metallurgical test results,"" said Beischer.

Building on the momentum set by its 2023 success, Alaska Energy is now looking to raise the funds to carry out a much larger 15,000-meter resource expansion and exploration drill program at Nikolai in 2024.

This campaign is expected to include resource expansion drilling at Eureka Zone, as well as testing high-grade nickel massive sulfide targets identified with 2023 geophysical surveys carried out at Canwell, a Nikolai claim block about 12 miles (19 kilometers) northwest of Eureka.

7488,"Did you know the healthcare spending in the U.S. takes up more than 21% of the national GDP: (OTCQB: MITI) Mitesco, Inc. We all use some form of health care, whether it's a yearly check up or more frequently. The most common form of health care is through primary care, which led me to try and find some investment opportunities in that sector and ultimately finding Mitesco. Primary care services have expanded to include mental health, physical health, wellness check-ups, urgent care, and broken bone and vaccine services. A pretty interesting statistic is that the spending on healthcare in the U.S. takes up more than 21% of the GDP. 

**Brief Overview**  
Mitesco, Inc. operated the Good Clinic, which is committed to improving the quality of care, reducing costs and enhancing consumer convenience in the health and wellness space through the acquisition and implementation of innovative technologies and services. The company's focus is on developing a portfolio of healthcare technology solutions companies, and the team has considerable experience in crafting deal structures that support long-term organizational value.

The Good ClinicTM uses a primary care model that employs nurse practitioners instead of physicians. This allows us to offer significant savings compared to traditional physician-based care.The primary care delivery model is being refocused on a clinical relationship focused on prevention, addressing the client’s goals and early detection. This is already resulting in continuous, long-term relationships, producing better outcomes and higher reimbursements per client and loyalty. 

The focus on maximizing fee-for-service revenue is resulting in primary care becoming more of a triage clinic, with shorter appointments and more prescriptions or referrals to specialists. At Good Clinic, they take the time to understand and treat the whole client, with an average appointment length of 39 minutes. They deliver personalized care plans that are tailored to each client's individual needs.

The company has six clinics in the Twin Cities and is working to increase growth by selling directly to employers for their employees on a recurring monthly fee basis. This concept replaces the old onsite clinic model that has been hurt by the increase in remote workers and having just a single location.

**Future Growth**

https://preview.redd.it/hgv7l9hpzk5a1.png?width=1217&format=png&auto=webp&s=4df9a4311f929bddd19eac108da44e6798efe8a5

With three clinics currently in development, their plan is to open an additional 50 clinics over the next three years, based upon the availability of capital. The company plans to expand its clinic business through organic growth and targeted acquisitions, as well as through the acquisition of technology solutions that will improve clinic operations.

**Final Thoughts**

Mitesco has the mission to provide quality care that is cost-effective and convenient for consumers. With the provision of primary care services can help to stem the rising tide of hospitalizations, prescription drug use, and chronic disease incidence. Mitesco seems to have all the capabilities to aid in curbing those factors. The primary care physician market is estimated to be worth $260 billion in 2021 and is predicted to grow at a compound annual rate of 3.2% from 2022 to 2030. So evidently there is a massive market for Mitesco and Good Clinic to navigate through.

Cup and handle setup on the W and D chart, I mean..  keep an eye on AUR in the coming days, most likely will dip a little more before a big move up.

I keep a tight stop loss just in case -

961,"HSBC’s record annual profit misses estimates on China write-down, shares tumble  HSBC
’s full-year 2023 pretax profit missed analysts’ estimates on Wednesday, hit by impairment costs linked to the London-based lender’s stake in a Chinese bank, sinking its shares as much as 5%.

Europe’s largest bank by assets saw its pre-tax profit climb about 78% to a record $30.3 billion in 2023 from a year ago, according to its statement released Wednesday during the mid-day trading break in Hong Kong. That missed median estimates of $34.06 billion from analysts tracked by LSEG.

Chief Executive Noel Quinn also announced an additional share buyback of up to $2 billion to be completed ahead of the bank’s next quarterly earnings report. HSBC also said it would consider offering a special dividend of 21 cents per share in the first half of 2024 after it completes the sale of its Canada business.

With the highest full-year dividend per share since 2008 and three share buy-backs in 2023 totaling $7 billion, Quinn said the bank returned $19 billion to shareholders last year.

HSBC suffered a “valuation adjustment” of $3 billion on its 19% stake in China’s Bank of Communications, Quinn said. In an interview with CNBC following the earnings release, he said this is “a technical accounting adjustment” and “not a reflection” on BoComm.

This write-down was among the items that plunged the bank’s fourth-quarter pretax profit by 80% to $1 billion from a year earlier.

HSBC’s Hong Kong shares reversed gains of about 1% after trading resumed, falling as much as 5%. The benchmark Hang Seng Index
 was up about 2%.

Here are the other highlights of the bank’s full year 2023 financial report card:

- Revenue for 2023 increased by 30% to $66.1 billion, compared with the median LSEG forecast for about $66 billion.
- Net interest margin, a measure of lending profitability, was 1.66% — compared with 1.48% in 2022.
- Common equity tier 1 ratio — which measures the bank’s capital in relation to its assets — was 14.8%, compared with 14.2% in 2022.
- Basic earnings per share was $1.15, compared with the median LSEG forecast for $1.28 in 2023 and 75 cents for 2022.
- Dividend per ordinary share was 61 cents — the highest since 2008 — compared with 32 cents in 2022.
Outlook 2024

HSBC, which has a second home in Hong Kong, said it was focusing on the fastest growing parts of Asia, a continent where the bank makes most of its profits.

In an earnings briefing to investors and analysts, the bank said it has completed the sale of its businesses in France, Oman, Greece and New Zealand, and was in the process of exiting Russia, Canada, Mauritius and Armenia.

3015,"I’m being blackballed from buying crypto … and I have no idea why. Long post, but I’m going to try to give as much information as possible so someone might be able to help me out.

About a week ago I put in my regular order for BTC on Coinbase. No issues.

A couple days ago when BTC dipped I went to buy more (my strike price would’ve been perfect), but the website asked for me to enter my payment method. I had it saved so that was weird, but ok. I checked the payment methods and found that my info was still there. I deleted it and reentered, then went back to the buy screen. Once again, it was asking for me to enter my payment info. Once again, it was still there, just not available on the buy screen.

I contacted customer support and was told there is a security lock on my account (why didn’t they just say that instead of being sketchy about it?) and they needed to do an account review. I was told also told
“*for the security of our users and accounts, we are not able to provide specific information regarding how this determination was made*."" 

Then also: “*Please note: that we can't guarantee a change to your current account status, and any decision based on our review will be final. For security reasons, we're also not able to provide additional information about this account review. We also don't have an estimated time when the review is completed*."" Ok, whatever, I’ll just do my business elsewhere.

I moved over to crypto,com and tried to make the purchase there. At the final window after processing the payment the notification “rejected” came up. I tried again, same thing. I contacted my bank and they said there was no issue on their end, they sent the funds and a minute later the funds were returned. My statement reflects. They suggested waiting a day then trying again.

So now the price is going back up from what I wanted (bummer), but I still wanted to buy some more. I tried on both coinbase and crypto and got the same issues. Can’t find a way to contact crypto,com customer service, and there’s no useful help articles.

So, I can’t buy crypto.

I’d try again with another exchange but I’m curious what the hell is going on and why I can’t buy. Any advice?

Edit: checked again today, and tried to pull the BTC from my transaction two days ago out of coinbase… and my account is restricted from sending crypto. Am I about to be ~~robbed~~ protected by ~~these f*ckers~~ my diligent and civil-serving law enforcement agency?

**Edit: I’ll keep the updates here so people can avoid my same mistakes. The general idea so far is that I made two purchases within a couple hours of each other that totaled just under $10,000, which could have flagged in the feds system as structuring to avoid tax inquiry. The boys in blue are likely doing an investigation right now to see what’s up. Given I haven’t done anything illegal, this should be cleared up with time. Again, I’ll let you fine folks know when I know.**"

RENO, NV, Jan. 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NewMediaWire -- Bullet Blockchain, Inc.

Looking for advice…
I’m having my second child next month, and once she gets a SSN, I was planning on opening a UGMA for her and one for my 17 month old son.
Does anyone recommend a good brokerage to go through? Like Fidelity or Vanguard?
Somewhere user friendly lol

I have a financial advisor at Raymond James, I think he’s retiring soon, but would prefer to kind of do this myself and allocate online and once the kids are old enough, choose investments together.

I’m consciously considering a UGMA over a 529, leaving the decision up to my kids about college, etc.  We live in CT, they’ll be 21 when the account transfer to them, and I’m feeling pretty hopeful I’ll raise them right to not piss away my efforts lol I know it’ll all be theirs and ultimately I’ll have no say. 

Also, once I do open the accounts, any recommendations on what to invest in to start with?  Like VOO or VTI?

Was planning on an initial deposit of around 1-2k each, then make contributions around the holidays of a couple hundred.  Unless we should plan for more?

The scenario is, an unemployed person with no other income, had invested in cryptocurrency awhile back and their investment is now at a profit of $150,000. Let’s say their cost basis was $1 for the sake of simple calculations.

Can they, by the end of 2024, sell $47,000 worth of the crypto, all under the 0% tax rate so they’ll pay $0 in taxes.

When 2025 starts, they rebuy $47,000 of the same crypto, and by the end of 2025, sell a other $94,000 worth of crypto. The net profit would be $47,000, again all under 0% tax rate.

Repeat until all investments have a net profit of $0 while still keeping the same holdings.

Is this illegal?

Edit to clarify: The goal is not to cash in profit tax free, but to turn $150,000 in profit into a holding with $150,000 cost basis, tax free. It can take as many years as it needs. Is it even legal to sell at Dec 31st and rebuy Jan 1st?"

600,"LUNR “BASED” DD **Preface:** I am not an astrophysicist, nor am I an acoustic space nerd. This is my first space stock. I am fairly new to investing in general. This is DEFINITELY not financial advice. I’m sure this will be highly regarded going forward…

Intuitive Machines symbol LUNR has launched Nova-C to deliver payloads to the moon. This will be the first moon landing completed by america in over 50 years and as far as I know, the first moon landing completed by a private company. The Nova-C is only a day away from being in the moon's orbit and about two days away from landing. The success in the landing will be a monumental moment for this company, but also incredibly pivotal. This will be revolutionary for the commercialization of space and the Nova-C is just the beginning. With goals of delivering payloads and eventually retrieving precious materials from space, this company clearly has a strong future. For more general information and more technical DD reference this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1atnihy/the\_value\_of\_lunr\_and\_why\_it\_could\_spike\_up\_500/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1atnihy/the_value_of_lunr_and_why_it_could_spike_up_500/)

**Will it Fail?:** I was nervous to bet on the launch because we’ve seen countless failed launches, but how many failed landings have you seen? We haven't landed on the moon in awhile, but we have never failed an actual landing. Now, to be fair, we’ve had failed moon missions because of technical difficulties in the spacecraft that occurred BEFORE the actual landing. Such as [Apollo 13](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/ap13acc.html#:~:text=The%20Apollo%2013%20malfunction%20was,it%20to%20lose%20oxygen%20rapidly.) or Intuitive Machines leading competitor, [Astrobotics, recent failure because of a fuel leak/Native American Curse](https://apnews.com/article/moon-landing-launch-private-nasa-0987b31b201b78c3935f1bfbf9a7cade) (more on that later). When have we ever failed a landing on the ISS? Never. Now again, I am not talking about missions being aborted before attempting touch down, I am talking about the literal moment of landing, which at this point is really all that’s left for the Nova-C. We have never failed this. (If we have someone please send me a source, most of this information was gathered in about 30 minutes.)

Is there still a chance we fail the landing? Of course. Are the chances of failing lower than ever? Yes. Our technology for trajectory and directional control in space has been stable for a long time, breaking out of the atmosphere is the hard part, the landing is straightforward. Especially for this company! They SPECIALIZE in accurate landings. Bard said this, “Intuitive Machines: Uses Nova-C, a single-stage lander designed for precise lunar landings and delivering payloads. They leverage existing technologies and partner with other companies for specific needs.” They're landing tech is perfected beyond belief, just look at this [inspiring animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYK5n6fcnyc).[ ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYK5n6fcnyc)

On this current mission they are set to deliver [5 NASA payloads](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=IM-1-NOVA). That means, fucking NASA, trusts this company to handle their billion dollar instruments, instead of just delivering it themselves. Apparently it's cheaper for NASA to deliver this way, but either way that is a lot of trust. THIS company will be responsible for aLL commercial payloads going forward. They will have a monopoly on delivering custom contracted research equipment and other payloads to space. Here are all the payloads the Nova-C is carrying:

&#x200B;

[Current Update: Nova-C is expected to be in the moon’s orbit by the 21st. They plan on announcing the time of the landing tomorrow, the 20th. They are currently looking to land sometime in the afternoon on February 22nd and will be live streaming the event on their website.](https://preview.redd.it/xjwy342mmmjc1.png?width=646&format=png&auto=webp&s=5efed552c58b4831c4756efec759ae2eda004954)

I’m planning on purchasing 1000 or so shares tomorrow, I will post a screenshot when I do.

Bonus Bull: Their main competitor has [**LITERALLY BEEN CURSED BY NATIVE AMERICANS.**](https://apnews.com/article/moon-landing-launch-private-nasa-0987b31b201b78c3935f1bfbf9a7cade)

**“Astrobotic drummed up its own freight business, packing the 6-foot-tall (1.9-meter-tall) Peregrine lander. On board the lander: a chip of rock from Mount Everest, toy-size cars from Mexico and ashes and DNA of deceased space enthusiasts, including “Star Trek” creator Gene Roddenberry and science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke.**

**The Navajo Nation recently sought to have the launch delayed because of the human remains. saying it would be a “profound desecration” of a celestial body revered by Native Americans. Astrobotic chief executive John Thornton said the December objections came too late but promised to try to find “a good path forward” with the Navajo for future missions.”**

Nova-C clearly has god on their side, but do they also have anime? We’ll see…

TL;DR: Rocket go up, Stock go up"

I am trying to create a tear sheet for any stock where I download its financial data, and can create a simple quantitative report on one page. I would appreciate your input. Are there any elements that you would add or delete?

8108,"Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for the week beginning July 4th, 2022 "
3773,"$EW.V looks to be ready for a game changer in early 2024, deals are starting. NZ, Romania and Future: 
After the NZ sale will be completed I expect the partner to drill a new well in Spring. Why else would they sell if they not want to continue operations? That totals the sale to USD 1.35 mln is CAD 2 mln. A big win in negotiations as last half year gross profit was only 125K.

Add the 2 mln to the CAD 5,2 mln cash and we got CAD 7,2 mln which is 8 cents per share and no debt nor decommissioning liabilities. Market cap is 5,4 mln. https://www.eastwestpetroleum.ca/news/news-releases/agreement-for-the-sale-of-new-zealand-oil--gas-properties

Now we got 15% ownership in Romania with NIS update to be expected with lots invested in exploring (estimated spending is USD $60 mln) at lower oil and gas prices. We would be producing with NSR% deal were it not for sanctions. Hopefully we get a large sum of cash in the sale. https://www.eastwestpetroleum.ca/projects/romania/

8 cents cash + Romania 15% assets VS stock price 6 cents My conclusion: BUY:EW #2024 here we come!

Let's hope management will (and I will push myself management hard for these changes after the holidays as well):

Make great deals with the cash, hopefully royalty deals, no production costs risk then for us.

Do a dividend as the inflation is painful to have cash. Please invest in good projects carefully but don't leave millions to collect dust on the balance sheet. That declines in value with inflation. We have 5 mln in cash since 2020, that's a lot of inflation! We don't need to hold so much in cash!

Inform investors with steady press releases with also using press releases for Quarterly financials.

Update the website and make (and keep updated) investor presentation.

Share buyback will be welcomed.

Share consolidation perhaps will be welcomed."
8331,"Everything you need to know from premarket so you know what the hell is going on before you start trading today **ANALYSIS:**

* Firstly, NVDA earnings are today. 
* Bloomberg is showing an 11% predicted volatility on earnings, as shown below. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/C1nuTr6](https://imgur.com/a/C1nuTr6)  
* NVDA is lower in premarket on continued profit taking, but we can notice a few things. Firstly, skew, which was pointing sharply lower has now reversed upwards, as IV in OTM calls increases. 680 was a key gamma level where traders tried to buy the dip from yesterday.   
 As we know earnigns are a risk. Earnigns when the stock is up 50% in the last quarter are an even bigger risk. We saw that in other earnings reports, like Google’s where good earnings were still punished based on valuation. 
* Bulls on NVDA are for the most part holding their positions.
* This is the net gex profile for NVDA, skewed mostly to calls still on all expirations. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/IlFyzTE](https://imgur.com/a/IlFyzTE) 
* On the 1 week to expirations, we can see more hedging for the earnigns. This clears up and the profile is again biased to calls when you look at monthly expirations. So traders hedge into earnings s that makes sense, but outlook still bullish. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/hzs6fu8](https://imgur.com/a/hzs6fu8) 
* Key levels for NVDA are:
* Call resistance at 700, although lots of calls on 750 too
* Put support is at 640
* Put support from 0dte options is at 650
* These will be key levels going into the earnigns print. 

——

* China points higher today as markets react to the cutting of 5 year rate yesterday. We noted on weekend that it seemed skew for Hong Kong was pointing higher and we could see calls building on 17k. It seems that traders are still expecting 17k to hit. 

A look at Oil:

* Spot price falls at the moment, as volatility continues as traders buy ATM puts to hedge for volatility.
* However, we can see from skew that there is a bullish divergence there on Brent. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/xtjaHfa](https://imgur.com/a/xtjaHfa) 
* Volatility continues due to the hedging and the evercahgning geopolitical landscape, as well as ever changing Fed expectations. 
* But overall, outlook still looks bullish. 

A look at BTC\\

* Looks like we can be seeing a local top here. IV in OTM calls is reducing, block trade flows also reduce. Skew points lower. May see some correction. 

A quick look at indices then:

* Volatility skew does point down as traders hedging with put options, but money flows from hedge funds hit new high yesterday. Funds are buying the dip, and not expecting it to last in medium term. A lot in the short term will depend on NVDA though. 
* Finally, if we look at Mag7 skew, we do see signs that market can continue to price correct. 
* We see Mag7 skew lower, which often leads the market. Traders are seeking some protection from the volatility in short term. 

**DATA LEDE:**

* KEY IS FOMC MINUTES WHICH IS RELEASED 2 HOURS BEFORE MARKET CLOSE. 
* Japan tankan business survey gives first negative reading on business sentiment since April 2023. 
* Japan Balance of Trade Numbers:
* Overall balance of trade was less negative than expected. 
* Exports grew more than expected up 12% YOY, ahead of expectations of 9.5%
* Imports fell more than expected, by 9.6% vs 8.4% expected.
* This means more exports and less imports, points to greater demand for JPY. Would expect JPY to rise on this. But JPY down on Japanese gov downgrades and business survey weakness. 
* Australia Wage Price index:FASTEST PACE OF RISE In 15 YEARS. 
* YOY comes 4.2% vs 4.1% forecast. Last quarter’s data revised up to 4.1% from 4%.
* QOQ comes 0.9% vs 0.9% forecast. 
* Hotter than expected wage data points to stickier service inflation and thus, a more hawkish RBA. 
* UK Record budget surplus for January:
* UK Chief secretary says that they still won’t speculate if tax cuts are affordable or not in the budget. 
* US mortgage demand numbers:
* Mortgage demand takes a hit, interest rates cross back over 7% on reduced rate cut expectations pushing up bond yields. 
* EU Consumer Confidence NUmbers:
* Later we have FOMC minutes - likely reveals more of what we know, continue to explain that we need to see more of the same data to be confident of cuts. Slight hawkish tone probably. 
* FED SPEAKERS: BOSTIC speaks, as does Bowman. 

**MARKETS:**

* SPX - yesterday, found support around 4955, before recovering back to 4977. Before Europe opened, was trading at 4972, dropped slightly on European open as FTSE100 sold off. 
* Nasdaq: Slightly lags SPX and DJI. This is due to the big sell off in PANW. Low of day yesterday was 17,400, before recovery to 17,550. Lower in premarket,. 
* DJI - Trading at around 38,500 in premarket, slightly down, at the low of the day from yesterday. 
* HKG market higher today on cutting of loan prime rate. Was up almost 4%, as high as 16,800, before paring some gain to 16,460. 
* China meanwhile is up 2% to 11,890. Key level here will be the 12k level, which it was rejected off of. 
* GER40: low of yday was 17,020. Trading quite flat. Today got a bit of a boost at open and is up 0.42% to 17062. This comes as we are seeing higher open interest on 17.5k
* UK market down 1%
* Gold higher again on softer dollar and Middle East geopolitics - 5th consecutive green day in a row. 
* OIL: down 0.8%. Little bit of correction here, as was trading 78.5 yesterday. Volatility is persistent but skew keeps higher, just with more hedging. 
* Bond yields slightly lower ahead of FOMC minutes later. 

**FOREX:**

* AUD was higher on hawkish wage data. 
* Dollar was lower into the FOMC minutes, pared slightly. 
* EURUSD and GBPUSD slightly lower back to 1.08.

# [Stock futures fall with bank shares under pressure from Moody’s downgrade: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/07/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures retreated Tuesday as a decline in bank shares dampened investor sentiment.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked lower by 191 points, or 0.5%. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.5% each.
*****
> Bank shares fell broadly after Moody’s downgraded the credit rating on several banks, including M&T Bank and Pinnacle Financial. The credit agency also placed Bank of N.Y. Mellon and State Street on review for a downgrade.
*****
> Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase traded lower in the premarket. The SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) slipped 2.3% in the premarket, while the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) dipped 2%.
*****
> Earnings season continued. UPS shares dropped more than 5% after the delivery giant reported weaker-than-expected revenue for the second quarter. The company also lowered its full-year revenue outlook. Educational tech company Chegg popped about 23% after reporting second-quarter revenue of $183 million, beating analysts’ estimate of $177 million, per Refinitiv.
*****
> The corporate earnings season has so far been better-than-expected. Roughly 86% of S&P 500 stocks have reported quarterly results, and nearly 80% of them have beaten Wall Street’s expectations, according to FactSet.
*****
> “The good news is that the earnings trough/recession is likely coming to an end, with earnings growth expected to accelerate over the coming quarters,” said Dylan Kremer, co-chief investment officer at Certuity. “Looking ahead, earnings projections seem a bit lofty to us relative to revenue growth estimates, particularly starting in Q1/24.”
*****
> On the economic data front, traders are looking ahead to July’s consumer price index report, out Thursday. The inflation metric could put Wall Street’s belief in a soft landing to the test. Economists polled by Dow Jones are calling for a monthly increase of 0.2% in July and a year-over-year rise of 3.3%.
*****
> Wall Street is coming off a strong performance Monday. The 30-stock Dow surged more than 400 points, or nearly 1.2%, for its best day since June 15. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.6%, and S&P 500 closed higher by 0.9%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and the S&P 500 broke four-straight sessions of losses.

2397,"Selling stocks at loss - taxes Question…bought stocks at $20,262.88

Sold stocks at $6930.70

My realized loss for 2023 was $13,332.18.  For taxes I can claim a $3000 loss each year until that amount is used up?

So when I file my taxes in 2023 I’ll take a $3000 loss

2024 taxes = $3000 loss

2025 = $3000 loss

2026 = $3000 loss

2027 = $1332.18 loss

2934,"Let's not get scammed Hi everyone, I'm making this post because this mental model has helped me avoid getting scammed in the past and I figure if it helps one of you then it's worth it. This model relates crypto actions to classic banking to help identity actions that aren't safe.

1) Giving out your seed phrase. 
This is like giving someone your credit card number, expiry date and pin and telling them to go wild.  NEVER give out your seed phrase to anyone, ever. Scams that say they need it are like someone telling you they need your card and pin to allow you to use Amazon or something - clear BS.

 2) Connecting your wallet to a site.
This doesn't have a clear equivalent in tradfi but it is a bit like putting your credit card down to pay in a restaurant. If we forget about contactless payments for a moment, the restaurant has your card and some details but can't make a payment because they don't have your pin.

Connecting your wallet should therefore be treated like this - would you trust that site to have your card details other than pin? If not, don't connect!

Connecting your wallet should NOT involve signing a transaction. If it does, that is a scam most likely.


3) Signing a transaction
This is like putting your credit card into a terminal and entering your pin. So, this is ok for a legitimate site but absolutely not ok for an illegitimate one. 

Something to be aware of is that in crypto when you sign a transaction, this comes with a separate thing called token approval and the amount approved is often infinite. In that case you trust the site to only take what they said they would. This is a bit like in tradfi entering your pin into a terminal that says infinite $ as the amount, and then trusting the terminal owner to only take an amount of $ that they said they would.

To avoid this, you can set a finite spending amount in your wallet. Most wallets now offer this as part of the transaction, you can usually press 'max' to set the approval amount to the transaction amount. In that case, you only allow the site to take whatever number of tokens you specified, not all of them.

Also consider getting a transaction previewing app like Pocket Universe or Fire. These are browser extensions that will preview what a transaction will do if you sign it, so you can avoid signing transactions that are going to drain your wallet.

Approvals of infinite amounts of tokens last forever. To end them, go to a contract approval checker like Unrekt and revoke the approvals.

4) Giving out your public (wallet) address
This is like giving someone your bank account number and sort code so that they can pay you. It is safe to do this as there's no way someone can steal your tokens just from having your public address.

It is worth keeping in mind that in crypto, everyone can see your transactions. So if you give someone your public address, they get the ability to see everything you've done with that wallet and wallets related to it. For this reason, you may want to set up multiple wallets that never interact with one another to keep some of your activities pseudononomous.

That's it, hope this is useful for someone. Stay safe out there everyone!"
3618,"A Promising Lithium Miner for 2024 : Li-FT Power Ltd. (TSXV: LIFT, OTCQX: LIFFF, Frankfurt: WS0) &#x200B;

Li-FT Power Ltd. (“**LIFT**” or the “**Company**”) (**TSXV: LIFT**) (**OTCQX: LIFFF**) (**Frankfurt:** **WS0**) is a mineral exploration company engaged in the acquisition, exploration, and development of lithium pegmatite projects located in Canada. 

A ‘pegmatite’ is an igneous rock created underground when interlocking crystals form during the final stages of magma of this.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t2jt7mo1gvcc1.png?width=270&format=png&auto=webp&s=d01e9b248e3415cb9fe7f7a5220b8584362e6789

Before I get into the aspects excellent lithium company, I want to alert traders to the volatility of this stock. If you are a day or momentum trader, keep LIFT in your sights.

The 52-week range is CDN$4=CDN$11. You can read 3 analyst targets below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q0d856o2gvcc1.png?width=1368&format=png&auto=webp&s=2221a76f2c6ff636703170ca9bac8d2780060dff

Why Lift? One fact is that LIFT has almost CDN18 million in cash and NO DEBT. Not only are you buying into a superb proxy for lithium, but LIFT—again, unlike many of its peers –has the financial muscle to explore further and develop. LIFT also has four properties (Moyenne, Rupert, Pontax and Moyenne) in the James Bay region of Quebec and one, Cali, that lies within the Little Nahanni Pegmatite Group in the Northwest Territories, near the Yukon border.

Now, we return to our regular programming.

On, January 9, 2024, LIFT released some great results.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yxdwond4gvcc1.png?width=1237&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f93ff7ab5f74c1fac06498fec1d1e5de3bcff79

**Highlights:**

* YLP-0125: **23 m at 1.50% Li2O, (Fi SW)**
* YLP-0138: **12 m at 1.51%** **Li2O, (Nite)**
* YLP-0135: **12m at 1.04%  Li2O         (BIG-West)**
* including 4 m at 1.62% Li2O
* YLP-0134:**mat1.07%Li2O,(BIG-West)**
* including 5 m at 1.65% Li2O

Francis MacDonald, CEO of LIFT, comments, “This week, we are releasing results for the first holes from the Nite pegmatite. The first interval of 12 m at 1.51% Li2O is of similar grade and width to the surface expression of the dyke. Fi Southwest also produced an excellent intersection this week, located, 200 m below the surface. We continue to encounter high grades at these depths.”

Seasoned metals investors who want to look beyond gold and silver are getting involved. In contrast, new investors are drawn into the space by electric vehicle (EV) demand forecasts and government initiatives to build EV infrastructure. (Investing News)

These are significant numbers. Lithium deposits typically have average grades of 1 to 3% Li2O and are commonly associated with tin, especially tantalum (Ta) mineralization. Nearly all of Australia’s resources are associated with granite pegmatites of the Archean age, found within the Pilbara and Yilgarn cratons of Western Australia. Here’s a list of intercepts worldwide. Check out eight from the bottom. I’ll save you the trip LIFT.

LIFT checks most of them in the world of hypothetical checkboxes, if not all. The significant supply /demand gap will lessen as new finds are well found.

LIFT’s most recent Corporate Deck

Analysts’ Coverage.

A new study published in *Science Advances* hypothesizes that the McDermitt Caldera — on the border between Nevada and Oregon — contains more than double the lithium concentration than any other bed of clay globally, around 20 to 40 million metric tons in total. (Nevada current)\\

Ain’t going to happen tomorrow, and the keyword is hypothetical. It still won’t be enough to take away today and the foreseeable future for quality juniors such as LIFT Power."

Powell also noted that interest rates could rise more than markets anticipate if inflation numbers do not abate, reversing some of the prior market optimism that rate hikes would soon ease.

> “The risk, however, is that premature easing in financial conditions, and in turn, a pick up in growth expectations, may be counterproductive from an inflation fighting point of view. Indeed, post the hot January payrolls report, a number of Fed speakers this week have talked up rates expectations, pushing back on Powell’s dovish talk.” Barclays analyst Emmanuel Cau wrote in a Friday note. “As a result, the disconnect between the Fed’s own rates forecasts and market pricing has noticeably narrowed, which has hurt US equities.”

2167,"Advice on starting a 529 for my niece To keep it as brief as I can, I just found out I am having a niece. And I would like to start saving in a 529 account to help her with college when she is older. Anyway I live in NY, but the kid will be raised in PA. I see each state has their own plan with benefits. My question is would it be more beneficial for me to have it as a New York 529 because I live here or in PA since that’s where the kid will be raised and likely go to college. 

For extra context I will be putting myself as the beneficiary, and switching it over to her once she is old enough, if that matters."

Big Developments in the CLEAN WATER and PFAS space:

**EPA proposes GenX, PFAS be treated as hazardous waste**

The Environmental Protection Agency is proposing to add nine per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, including GenX, to its list of chemicals that should be treated as hazardous waste.

EPA Administrator Michael Regan signed the proposal Wednesday to modify the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, to include the nine PFAS, their salts, and their structural isomers, according to a release.

“This  change would facilitate additional corrective action to address  releases of these specific PFAS at RCRA hazardous waste treatment,  storage, and disposal facilities,” the release states.

**This is coming together as BLGO had envisioned.  This, if enacted, would mean that Legacy GAC and IX system will become much more expensive.**

&#x200B;

**Keep in mind the BLGO AEC generates 1/48000th of the waste footprint of carbon systems.**

As of today **not even our basher** community **was able to find a better PFAS remediation solution.**

Any market share in this trillions of dollars remediation market will make many happy investors.

* **Stage one of a big contract was executed- regulatory demand might initiate stage two.**
* **The first purchasing order by a municipality was PRed a couple of months ago.**

https://preview.redd.it/s397kmmawmgc1.png?width=1140&format=png&auto=webp&s=c25f2caa7e34ccb1614ebd4812d6ad0bfbd0d6de

&#x200B;

Here is the initial reaction from BLGO:

Tonya Chandler, president of the newly formed subsidiary BioLargo Equipment Solutions and Technology and the BLGO CEO Dennis Calvert:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Reaction From BLGO to the EPA release](https://preview.redd.it/8fjg9uwn2ngc1.png?width=1362&format=png&auto=webp&s=13e46ff1516fb811fef17723695d08cd0496caf0)

**Let's dive in more:**

You might think how could a tiny $60 Million market cap company have developed the potentially best solution for PFAS remediation?

Members of BLGO's Engineering have been with BioLargo for five years and joined the team all   at once after being laid off by what was **one of the largest engineering  firms in the world, Chicago Bridge & Iron**, before being merged into  McDermott International Inc. (MDR:NYSE)

They have been key people in cleaning up some of the biggest contamination problems.

**Calvert   said the ""group has become a cornerstone of innovation, and it has   services that give us entrée to just about any customer in the world.""**

BLGO was presenting their tech for the first time at the biggest water convention in North America WEFTEC and their tech got a ton of attention.

This is the video that played as a loop -

[**The BioLargo AEC - the effective, sustainable solution for removing PFAS from water**](https://youtu.be/unx9coSjIuQ?si=PNeoiqkIExnMOZhH)

**BioLargo Aqueous Electrostatic Concentrator (AEC)**

One of the most thrilling developments is the commercial adoption of   BioLargo's AEC technology for PFAS collection by a municipality. PFAS,   or Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a group of man-made chemicals notorious for their longevity in the environment and the human body.   BioLargo's AEC technology could become a go-to solution in the massive   global cleanup market, estimated to be worth a stunning $13 trillion

PFAS contamination affects drinking water supplies all around the world.

**As of today, BioLargo has the most effective and most efficient targeted PFAS Collecting Tech in this $60 Billion/Year US  market**

https://preview.redd.it/6e6bbnfswmgc1.png?width=3186&format=png&auto=webp&s=166963312ef091f640b4fb882f42323b95213ad7

Per-   and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are an expansive group of   man-made chemicals found in countless manufactured goods including   electronics, non-stick cookware, food packaging, and more. Overwhelming   evidence links them to health effects including cancer, developmental   disorders, and thyroid dysfunction.

PFAS   are now known to contaminate thousands of drinking water supplies in   the U.S. and around the world. PFAS also contaminate lakes, rivers, and   other surface water. They have been detected in the polar ice caps. 

**BioLargo Aqueous Electrostatic Concentrator (AEC)**   is designed to provide a rapid, effective, and   affordable concentration of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)   in water. It works by separating PFAS compounds in an electrostatic   field and forcing them through a proprietary membrane system.

* Business model: sell, install, service, exchange membranes through project life
* Removes 99% of PFOA and PFOS in a single stage. Capable of “non-detect” levels, Meeting new EPA requirements
* Produces   very little waste - up to 40,000 times less than carbon alternative   (\~80,000 lbs of waste from carbon vs \~2 lbs of waste from AEC)
* We handle all the PFAS- laden Waste, making regulatory compliance easy and affordable
* Low energy cost, No chemicals required

BioLargo   just PRed the first purchasing order by a municipality that was   recommended by the best-rated environmental engineering firm in NJ.rces   to address key challenges, including climate change, emerging   contaminants like per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and   cybersecurity.“

**And BioLargo has** [**The BEST PFAS TREATMENT**](https://www.bestpfastreatment.com/) **- Must click the link for all the info about the tech!**

BioLargo   just PRed the first purchasing order by a municipality. The tech was   recommended by the best-rated environmental engineering firm in NJ.

John W. Clark, Jr. President of Lake Stockholm Systems, Inc. said,

>“After   an extensive review of the available technologies, including input  from  our engineers and the state of New Jersey, we selected the  BioLargo AEC  to ensure the drinking water in our community was free of  harmful PFAS  chemicals. BioLargo’s solution will give us the peace of  mind and  guarantee that we can meet remediation requirements, both  today and in  the future.” 

BioLargo’s President and CEO Dennis P. Calvert commented,

>“Lake   Stockholm Systems recognized our technology as a more eco-friendly,   regulation-friendly, and cost-effective long-term solution for treating   water contaminated by PFAS. We believe the success of this project will   play a big role in attracting further municipal water treatment   customers, many of whom are still under the misconception that carbon   filtration or ion exchange are the only options for long-term PFAS   remediation.”

https://preview.redd.it/2yfjiw23xmgc1.png?width=3176&format=png&auto=webp&s=52822362d547b6ceece2a0a92b845e3727b39dd1

Mr. Calvert continued,

>“Our   technology reduces costs customers pay to dispose of the harmful and   hazardous waste produced by any technology removing PFAS from water. For   example, where a carbon system might produce 80,000 pounds of  hazardous  spent carbon at the end of its life, we can treat the same  volume of  water and produce less than five pounds of solid waste. With  CERCLA and  RCRA regulations looming, which will require handling  PFAS-laden solid  waste as hazardous materials, legacy technologies  simply won’t be able  to compete with the AEC in this area.”

&#x200B;

The   first 8 AEC channel partners are also on board that are preparing for   the national launch of the AEC technology, and regulations are playing   into our hands as well.

We see  new  destruction technologies getting invented and as of today we were  not  able to find a technology that would not benefit from a AEC   implementation ahead in the process -That is why it was recently named:

# [Dow futures are flat after failed First Republic is sold to JPMorgan: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/30/stock-futures-are-flat-after-dow-notches-best-month-since-january.html)
*****
> U.S. stock futures hovered around the flatline Monday after the major averages logged gains for April, and traders assessed the takeover of failed bank First Republic.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow climbed 21 points, or 0.06%, while S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures were flat.
*****
> The moves come after news that JPMorgan Chase has acquired all of troubled lender First Republic’s deposits and a “substantial majority of assets,” according to a release. JPMorgan’s shares rose 3% in premarket trading on the news.
*****
> “This takes away the uncertainty for the market,” Sarat Sethi, managing partner at DCLA, told CNBC’s “Worldwide Exchange” on Monday. “What you’ve seen now is an agreement where depositors will be taken over, and you’ve got some type of guarantee there. That’s important for the market because, you don’t want to see this kind of thing unravel.”
*****
> First Republic reported last week that deposits tumbled more than 40% in the first quarter, triggering further declines in the already struggling stock. Shares have cratered 97% since the start of the year.
*****
> The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) rose about half a percent in the premarket, as investors bet the crisis that ignited in March had been contained.
*****
> Stocks are coming off a winning week and month. On Friday, the blue-chip Dow added 272 points, or 0.8%, while the S&P 500 rose 0.83%. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.69% as Big Tech earnings took center stage.
*****
> For the month, the Dow gained 2.5% to notch its best monthly stretch since January, while the benchmark index gained 1.5%. The tech-heavy index posted marginal gains. Earnings reports from major tech companies dominated much of last week’s market debate, fueling the narrative that earnings are faring better-than-feared, despite many widespread macroeconomic concerns.
*****
> So far, a little over half of S&P 500 companies have reported earnings, with more than 79% and about 72% surpassing earnings and sales expectations, respectively. First-quarter earnings are currently on track to fall 3.7% for the period, a smaller drop than the 6.7% decline projected on March 31, according to FactSet.
*****
> “There was definitely a very positive surprise on the big tech earnings,” said Jan Szilagyi, CEO of Toggle AI. “There was a certain trepidation going into the earnings season,” as expectations called for relative weakness.
*****
> Monday kicks off another busy week for earnings, with results from Norwegian Cruise Line and MGM Resorts. Reports from Pfizer, Starbucks, Advanced Micro Devices and CVS Health are due out later in the week.
*****
> Reports from many of these technology giants helped to lift some market confidence, he added.
*****
> In other news, investors anxiously await the latest rate hike decision from the Federal Reserve, due out Wednesday at the conclusion of the central bank’s policy meeting. As of Monday morning, about 89% of traders anticipate a 25 basis point rate hike, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool. Wall Street will closely monitor remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, offering clues into the central bank’s forward policy path.
*****
> Wall Street also awaits ISM manufacturing data, construction spending and S&P Global manufacturing PMI on Monday. April’s nonfarm payrolls report is on deck Friday.

Does that specific account need $25k, or am I good since the total of the accounts is over $25k?

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 4th, 2022.

# **Markets will be looking for clues from the Fed ahead, as historically strong month gets underway - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/01/markets-will-be-looking-for-clues-from-the-fed-ahead-as-historically-strong-month-gets-underway.html)**
*****
> The stock market is heading into what promises to be a volatile second quarter, but April is traditionally the best month of the year for stocks.
*****
> The major indices were higher in March, but they turned in a weak performance for the first quarter, the worst since the pandemic. Investors have been worried about rising interest rates, the war in Ukraine and inflation, which was made even worse by disruptions in commodities exports from both Russia and Ukraine.
*****
> Stocks are typically higher in April, and it is historically the best month of the year for the S&P 500. The S&P has been higher 70% of the time and has gained an average 1.7% in all Aprils since World War II, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. For all months, the S&P averaged a gain of 0.7%.
*****
> The S&P 500 was up 3.6% in March, and Stovall said the rally could continue. “I think we get back to breakeven, but then I wouldn’t be surprised if we go through another pullback or correction before we have an end of year rally,” he said.
*****
> Market focus in the week ahead will remain squarely on developments around the Ukraine war and on the Federal Reserve. The Fed on Wednesday is scheduled to release minutes from its March meeting, where it raised interest rates for the first time since 2018.
*****
> There are also a handful of Fed speakers, including Fed Governor Lael Brainard, who speaks Tuesday.
*****
> Greg Faranello, AmeriVet Securities head of U.S. rates, said the Fed minutes could be the highlight of the week since the central bank is likely to provide more detail on its plans to shrink its balance sheet. The Fed has nearly $9 trillion in securities on its balance sheet, and a reduction of those holdings would be another step to tighten policy.
*****
> “The market is curious. They’re going to be looking for some clues in terms of how quickly, how big, what the caps look like,” said Faranello.
*****
> The economic data calendar is light, with factory orders Monday, international trade and ISM services Tuesday and wholesale trade Friday.
*****
> Traders will also be watching for any comments from companies ahead of the first-quarter earnings reporting season, which starts in mid-April.
*****
> “The first-quarter earnings have actually been improving in the last month, so that’s encouraging,” said Stovall.
*****
> # Farewell to first quarter
> The Dow was off 4.6% for the first quarter, while the S&P 500 was down 5%. The worst performer by far was the Nasdaq, down 9.1%. In the past week, stocks were barely changed. The Dow was down 0.1%, while the S&P was up 0.1%. The Nasdaq was up 0.7%.
*****
> Interest rates also moved dramatically during the quarter, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield temporarily touching a high of 2.55% in the past week, after starting the quarter at 1.51%.
*****
> On Friday, the 10-year was yielding 2.37%, while the two-year yield, which most reflects Fed policy, was at 2.45%. The two-year was yielding 0.73% at the beginning of the year.
*****
> Faranello said bond yields can keep going higher on inflation concerns, but they could consolidate before another big move.
*****
> “I think the market is looking for a new catalyst here,” he said. “I just think the first quarter has been about repricing the market, and we’ve done that...The Fed came out very hawkish. We made made a dramatic repricing. Now, we need to see more data to see how this is going to evolve in the second quarter.”
*****
> Stovall said the S&P 500′s first-quarter performance is one of the 15 worst first quarters, going back to 1945. After those weak quarters, down 3.8% or more, the second quarter was better on average. This year’s first-quarter decline was tied with 1994, which had the 12th worst first quarter.
*****
> After those 15 weak first quarters, “we actually climbed 4.8% in the second quarter and rose in price two out of every three times,” he said. But for the full year, the S&P 500 gained just 40% of the time, and was down an average 2% in those years.
*****
> But this year is a midterm election year, and in those years the second and third quarters are typically the weakest. “Of those 15 worst quarters, five of them were midterm election years, and of those five, the second quarter was up an average 1%, and it rose in price only 40% of the time,” Stovall said.
*****
> Stovall said the market could be higher in the second quarter, but it will face headwinds. “Oil prices are likely to remain up. Interest rates are certainly not coming down,” he said, adding geopolitical pressures are likely to remain. “I see the possibility of a 1% gain. We could probably eke out something good.”
*****
> Stocks were held hostage by rising and volatile oil prices in the first quarter, as the world scrambled to make up for Russia’s export barrels. Many customers refused to buy Russian oil for fear of running afoul of financial sanctions on Russia’s financial system.
*****
> After wild swings both higher and lower, West Texas Intermediate oil futures gained 39% in the first quarter, the eighth positive quarter in a row and its best first quarter since 1999. WTI was just under $100 per barrel Friday afternoon.
*****
> # Choppy, volatile market
> Joe Quinlan, head of CIO Market Strategy for Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank, said he is constructive on the market heading into the second quarter, but he sees some rough spots ahead.
*****
> “We’ve got to work through the inflation problem, and the Fed catching up to the expectations of the market,” Quinlan said. “We’ve got to re-anchor inflation. It’s going to be a choppy, volatile year. We’re tilting more toward hard assets, whether it’s commodities, energy and natural gas.”
*****
> Quinlan said he leans towards equities over fixed income, which has also been unusually volatile. “We’re using equities as a hedge against inflation,” he said. “Within that framework is more hard assets, fuels, agriculture complex in general and metals and minerals.”
*****
> In the second quarter, the stock market will continue to adjust to an aggressive Federal Reserve against the backdrop of what should have been a solid economy. With 431,000 payrolls added in March, jobs data continues to be strong, but there is a fear the Fed will raise interest rates too quickly, derailing the economy and spinning it into recession.
*****
> Traders in the futures market expect the Fed will increase its fire power at its next meeting in early May, hiking interest rates by 50 basis points, or a half-percent. The Fed’s first rate increase was a quarter-point at its March meeting.
*****
> The market is pricing in the equivalent of eight quarter-point hikes, and Treasury yields have moved higher with stunning speed as market expectations for interest rates shifted. The two-year Treasury yield rose above the 10-year yield, or inverted this past week, for the first time since 2019. That is viewed by the market as a warning sign for a recession.
*****
> Fed officials have signaled they want to move to trim the balance sheet soon. Kansas City Fed President Esther George this past week said the Fed’s balance sheet will need to decline significantly. She said the Fed’s holdings of Treasurys may have depressed the 10-year yield, causing the yield curve to invert.
*****
> Faranello said interest rates could still head higher on inflation worries, but rates could consolidate after their recent run higher. The yield curve could also remain inverted.
*****
> “We can stay like this for a year-and-a-half. Everyone’s screaming a recession is coming...I don’t think the yield curve is telling us a recession is just about to happen,” Faranello said.

> # Here Comes the Best Month of the Year

> After one of the worst starts to a year ever for stocks, March has seen a huge bounce. Incredibly, the S&P 500 Index is only about 4% away from new all-time highs. The big question is can the near-term strength continue?

> “The good news is stocks really appear to love April. Not only is it the best month on average since 1950, but it has also been higher an incredible 15 of the past 16 years as well,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&P 500 has indeed closed green in April in 15 of the past 16 years.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Blog-3.30.22.png))**

> Taking a deeper look at April reveals that it’s not just the best month for stocks since 1950—it’s also the best month in the past 20 years and the second best month in the past decade. If there is one flaw, it is that in a midterm year it ranks only seventh and is barely positive.

> # Asset Class Performance by Weekday

> As Vladimir Lenin once wrote ""There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen."" For investors, each passing day of late has felt like a month, as Powell's Pivot, the Ukrainian conflict, rampant inflation, supply chain constraints, and COVID have caused rapid shifts in investor sentiment, leading to heightened volatility. With each day feeling like an eternity, we decided to look into the average performance by weekday to provide you with insights into trading patterns based on the day of the week.

> The last twelve months have seen a divergence in performance from the norms of the last 30 years. On a trailing 12-month basis, the S&P 500 has performed poorly on Mondays and Tuesdays before gaining steam from Wednesday through Friday. This diverges from the patterns seen over the last thirty years, in which Thursday and Friday struggled relative to the performance over the first three trading days of the week. This year, oil has averaged gains on every day of the week, but the strongest performance has occurred early in the week, which is interesting as Monday and Tuesday have tended to be the worst days of the week for oil over the last 30 years. Bonds have performed poorly in the beginning of the week over the last twelve months but have partially recovered in the last two trading days. Over the long run, the safe asset has traded narrowly with only Wednesdays averaging a loss. Tuesdays and Thursdays have been strong days for the US Dollar over the last twelve months, but these days tend to result in flat to negative performance when looked at over the last 30 years.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/SPX-daily-chg-by-WD-032822-2.png))**

> Below we summarize the cumulative performance by weekday for the S&P 500 over the last 30 years. As you can see, Tuesday has been the best performing day by far, booking performance gains of 160.5%. Wednesday has posted a cumulative gain of 83.6%, which lands the day in second place. Friday and Thursday have been the weakest days, booking a cumulative gain of just 27.4% and 28.2%, respectively. Monday lands in the middle, recording a cumulative gain of 41.3%. As outlined above, the recent shift in weekday performance deviates from the norms of the last 30 years as investors have come out of the weekend with fears but concluded the week with optimism.

> # Strong Performance at the Tail Ends of Breadth

> While the index turned lower today on weaker breadth, the recent rally for the S&P 500 has come on strong breadth resulting in the 10-day advance/decline line to surge to some of the highest readings on record. Monday and Tuesday saw 99th percentile readings in the 10-day A/D line and even after the decline today, the current reading remains in the 96th percentile. At Monday's high, the 10-day AD line reached the most elevated level since October 2020. On a sector level, in the past week Financials, Health Care, Materials, Real Estate, and Tech also all saw 99th percentile readings in their own 10-day advance-decline lines.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/033022-SP-500-AD-Line.png))**

> In the matrix below, we show the average forward performance of the S&P 500 broken down by the percentile range that the index's 10-day AD line is in. Generally, lower readings in the 10-day AD line have been followed by stronger returns whereas higher readings have been followed by weaker returns. That is, except for the most elevated readings. Readings in the upper decile have actually been followed by more consistently positive and stronger than normal average returns for the S&P 500. In other words, strong breadth is typically a more negative signal for the S&P 500 going forward, but an extremely strong breadth reading has actually been positive.

> # Down Q1 Midterm Years & Bear Market Bottoms

> As we enter the last month of the Best Six Months, the market logged its first down quarter in two years since the beginning of the pandemic. Going back to 1930 when our S&P 500 data begins Q1 was positive 55 years and negative 37 times over the 92-year span. Overall, years that advanced in Q1 were up 46 of the 55 years or 83.6% of the time with an average gain of 13.2% for S&P 500. Years when Q1 was down, were positive only 16 of the 37 years or 43.2% of the time for an average loss of -0.1%.

> What jumped out at us were the midterm years that had losing first quarters. In the table we compiled here, the events during these years have an eerie resonance to what’s happening today in 2022. War, conflict, inflation, recession, and rate hikes were common themes in these midterm years. Only three of these 10 midterm years had sizable gains: 1938 (War in Europe), 1942 (WWII) and 1982 (Secular Bull). Losses carried over into Q2 in all but 3 years: 1938, 1942 and 2018. Third quarters rebounded in all but three years: 1966 (Vietnam), 1974 (Oil Embargo/Watergate) and 2002 (Iraq). The only real Q4 blemish was 2018 when the Fed hiked rates too briskly.

> In general, after a down midterm Q1, losses tended to carry over into Q2 and the market began to find its footing in Q3 and rally into Q4. Protracted crises in 1962, 1966, 1970, 1974, and 2002 delivered the most negative results though all had significant bear market bottoms. At the Q1 crossroads in 2022 we are faced with similar conditions. Persistent hyperinflation (Jeff’s large iced black coffee is up 29% in the last month from $3.02 to $3.89), a rising rate environment that’s stoking inverted yield curve/recession fears, the brutal war in Ukraine and the new Cold War 2.0 with Russia are threatening a bear market on the backdrop of the heightened volatility we have been warning of since our Annual Forecast in December.

> # Bears Go Back Into Hibernation

> The last couple weeks of the first quarter have seen equities reverse a sizable portion of this year's losses and sentiment has rebounded in sync, though, bullish sentiment turned slightly lower this week in spite of the S&P 500's move higher. From the weekly AAII sentiment survey, bullish sentiment shed 0.9 percentage points coming in at 31.9%. Even after that decline, the current level of reported optimism remains above all others (outside of last week) since early January, but bullish sentiment still would need to rise another 6 percentage points to move back up to its historical average.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/033122-AAII-Bull.png))**

> While more investors are not reporting much optimism, fewer are outright bearish. Bearish sentiment fell for a second week in a row falling another 7.9 percentage points to 27.5%. With a little over a quarter of respondents reporting as bearish, this sentiment reading is at the lowest level since November. That is also now the biggest two-week decline in bearish sentiment (22.3 percentage points) since November 2009 when it had fallen 23.74 percentage points in a two-week span.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/033122-AAII-Bear.png))**

> Finally, we would note that given bearish sentiment has plummeted at a historic rate without much of an increase in bullish sentiment, neutral sentiment has picked up the difference. That reading clipped above 40% this week for the highest level since January 2020.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/033122-AAII-Neutral.png))**

> Other sentiment surveys like the Investors Intelligence one and NAAIM's Exposure Index have also pivoted more bullish this week. As a result, our sentiment composite is close to zero meaning across these three indicators, sentiment is now only just slightly below the historical average.

2912,"Navigating Crypto Purchase Challenges as a Diplomat Without Permanent Residency: Seeking Advice Hello everyone,

I’m encountering some hurdles purchasing crypto due to my diplomatic status and lack of permanent residency. Here’s my situation:

	•	I work as a diplomat in Japan without permanent residency. My salary is deposited into a Japanese bank account, my employer retains my taxes and I file  annually in my home country. My only income is my salary. 

	•	Although I maintain bank accounts in my home country and Spain, I rarely use them. As a dual citizen of my home country and Spain, my Spanish account has minimal activity, and I’m not a resident of Spain.
	•	While I previously lived in the US, I’m not a resident there anymore. I have an active credit card for specific services and regularly transfer money from Japan to the US to settle the balance.
	•	Despite residing in Japan, I’m unable to purchase crypto due to my non-resident status.

I’m considering sending my savings in Euros to my Spanish account to facilitate the purchase, but I’m concerned about potential taxation implications in Spain, especially since I’ve never dealt with Spanish taxes and I’m not a resident there.

Additionally, I’m open to buying from the US, but I’m unsure about the tax implications with the IRS. Exchanges often ask for residency, and since I’m not a resident in the US anymore, it adds another layer of complexity.

Recently, a friend suggested exploring the Palau Digital Residency. Has anyone navigated this process successfully, particularly opening a bank account in Palau for purchasing crypto?

I’m open to any advice, ideas, or alternative solutions to facilitate my crypto purchase. Your insights are greatly appreciated!"
574,"Investing in the life cycle of racing simulators for Formula 1 This is a due diligence on the growth of the e-sim market by having found tonnes of trades all correlated to each other adding to my returns. 

The e-sim game racing business is HUGE. The whole life-cycle provides so many opportunities, i'll share a few here. This is a photo of the simulators in the Red Bull Ring last time I visited. 

https://preview.redd.it/g42j6vtbvqjc1.jpg?width=539&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6c6d6cd131da90e5cbfceff195f0665ddefe6f4d

 The two most realistic ones are Thrustmaster and Fanatec and these two also already sponsored by Formula one (a billion dollar industry). On top; when i was at the Red Bull Ring F1 track in Austria, Fanatec was there too; 

https://preview.redd.it/fv32samqvqjc1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=985176748132fd040425f8131ddfbceac73d7cb9

Problem is, (the F1 circus) is owned by Liberty Media Group. A bunch of corporate capitalist fat cats.

They basically only earn on licensing rights and entertainment. And they believe they don't earn enough and threaten every body. ViaPlay is for example of the main streamers in Europe; and well, let’s say they overpaid a little for the ‘licensing rights to showcase the races’. The firm is basically dead, but people keep throwing ‘debt’ in there. It’s all fraud and greed (i’ve had emails back and forth).

https://preview.redd.it/q2mn5v9uvqjc1.jpg?width=599&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb9499015273fac76c3b9b02924d2996f69c41d0

Liberty Media wants Formula one to become some kind of ‘Disney Attraction’ - something to never forget. Disgusting. FIA (the governing body who sets out the rules for the races are already clashing with Liberty Media).

[**https://english.elpais.com/sports/2023-01-30/fia-and-liberty-media-in-spat-over-control-of-formula-1.html**](https://english.elpais.com/sports/2023-01-30/fia-and-liberty-media-in-spat-over-control-of-formula-1.html)

Drivers have been complaining about ""formula one becoming 99% politics and 1% meritocracy racing.

https://preview.redd.it/zmkquf3zvqjc1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c9ee325902b89b98857e4b9769c33d0d7016258b

Btw that kid won the F1 world tournament. Now Thrustmaster looks private, but it isn't. It's owned by Guillemot corporation (French listed stock).

Fanatec is a hidden gem under ([http://Endor.Ag](http://endor.ag/)) stock - German. 

Fanatec has a tiny market cap so I suspect the Chinese might want to take them over. Why? The sim racing market is huge and will go in the billions coming years.

Because Fanatec already has the name, sponsors, I mean, a 100m market cap stock with formula one sponsoring.

https://preview.redd.it/zmd4eg64wqjc1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=721b81c637715f38d8b096a2f8126ff2cb8473c6

On top Liberty Media which owns all this crap does nothing else but earn on ""licensing of TV rights"". And it's not enough, although it broke the European counterpart to stream F1 completely; ViaPlay a Scandinavian streaming stock, but basically dead... To late to short that one.

[https://www.gpblog.com/en/news/244896/viaplay-is-in-financial-distress-according-to-woerts.html](https://www.gpblog.com/en/news/244896/viaplay-is-in-financial-distress-according-to-woerts.html)

Liberty Media requires more liquidity, they still own Sirius Radio. I suspect (I saw Warren Buffet a few days ago upping their stake in Sirius) and I immediately thought of Spotify (which never made a profit and should be dead).

Or that they sell it off. Buffet in his latest filing:

Sirius XM Holdings (SIRI)

*""Berkshire significantly boosted its stake in satellite radio provider Sirius XM Holdings during the fourth quarter. Berkshire now holds more than 40 million shares worth about $220.1 million at the end of 2023. Berkshire held just under 10 million shares at the end of September 2023""*

The competition comes out of China. Moza racing (Chinese race simulators); [https://mozaracing.com/about-us](https://mozaracing.com/about-us)

Are climbing up because they can offer cheaper prices. Moza as entity is secretly hidden under;

*Shenzhen Gudsen Technology Co Ltd.*

They don't have financial documentation on their website. Smells like ""state sponsoring"". Educational guesses don’t always have to be wrong. But we know the simulator business is growing massively...

https://preview.redd.it/7bmr7dihwqjc1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=044308a4e9c347ce3636095b539cbd69dde63722

[**https://www.alongtheracingline.com/sim-racing-revolution/**](https://www.alongtheracingline.com/sim-racing-revolution/)

However Thrustmaster and Fanatec are already in bed with F1, have the sponsors. Massively undervalued.

The way I see it for trading;

* small long stake in Sirius, just like buffet has done
* small long stake in Endor (as no one knows Endor but do know fanatec)
* small long stake in Guillemot corporation (thrustmaster)
* small long stake in Emerson Electric Co.
* deep otm put on Liberty Media

Initial input was around $50k, return is already >10%. I've been playing Liberty Media the whole of last year during the F1 events and doubled my returns. Listened to the investor calls and they basically want to make Formula One in some form of destruction derby. 

I am leaving ViaPlay the F1 streaming alone. On accounting fundamentals they dead already. Or will die soon. Why the long poisitions? Simulators are used by the real drivers and the fans. A simulator requires accessories. There is a ‘lifecycle’’. In other words if the market expects the simulator market to grow I also expect more simulators.

[**https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/inside-story-how-red-bull-s-f1-simulator-really-works/639880/**](https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/inside-story-how-red-bull-s-f1-simulator-really-works/639880/)

In other words; *electromechanical actuators*. Thus **Emerson**.

I'm trying to capture as much of the lifecycle of this simulator. From first block to finalized in the VIP hall in an F1 track. I am running additional code on correlation between 

1) Tires - Pirelli is a listed stock

2) games - Like Electronic Arts 

This basically makes one ‘whole event’ - (the growth in sim racing) - into a various wide variety of plays that all seem feasible and backed up by facts. But i've got these in place already. 

That excludes that during even F1 race I have trades in place (airlines/hotels/etc). Exuberant people enjoy paying premiums. "
8630,"New Cybersecurity Play to Take a Closer Look at (CSE: ICS) ‘Smart Cities” use various software, user interfaces and communication networks alongside the Internet of Things (IoT) to deliver connected solutions for the public. Of these, the IoT is the most important. The IoT is a network of connected devices that communicate and exchange data.

How is AI used to tackle cybercrime? In cybersecurity, AI is frequently used to distinguish “good” entities from “bad.” AI-powered security systems offer real-time alerts to potential threats and continuously monitor networks, devices, and applications, removing dangerous human delay and response.

Investors would agree that a cybersecurity component would be critical. Keep reading.

Since its inception, the Digital Dubai Office has launched over 130 initiatives in partnership with government and private sector entities. Some key initiatives include the Dubai Data Initiative, the Dubai Blockchain Strategy, the Happiness Agenda, the Dubai AI Roadmap and the Dubai Paperless Strategy.

**Sobering up**

Revenue in the cybersecurity market is projected to reach US$166.20 billion in 2023. Security Services dominates the market with a projected market volume of US$87.97 billion in 2023. Revenue is expected to show an annual growth rate (CAGR 2023-2028) of 10.48%, resulting in a market volume of US$273.60 billion by 2028.

By 2030, cybercrime revenue will reach USD10.5 trillion. By no means a small market, that growth is 25% higher than the current market. That’s a merde a load of money. Not to mention the physical cyber damage potentially done.

**Salient Initiatives**

*  a challenge between Dubai’s government and semi-government data strategy partners to accelerate the collection and submission of data.
* The ethical AI Toolkit has been created to provide practical help across a city ecosystem

Dubai has retained its top spot in the Middle East and North Africa region regarding global engagement after ranking 23rd out of 156 cities in this year’s Global Cities Index.

It is the third consecutive year that Dubai has claimed a spot in the top 25 of the index, management consultancy Kearney said. Globally, the region is in 50th place.

Combining these and other functions into a single, connected infrastructure to create more efficient, intelligent systems requires balancing smart cities and cybersecurity. More innovative communities are vulnerable to a city cyber-attack because of the increased connectivity across multiple functions.

What kind of attacks? More straightforward to list what will not be attacked. Short, likely nonexistence list.

I would also bring your attention to this Deloitte piece, which, while it must make you an expert, will pretty definitely give investors the consequences of eschewing a cybersecurity system. The potential catastrophic risk to Smart City technology is both obvious and frightening.

“*According to our survey, not all smart city technologies pose equal risks,” the authors wrote. “Cybersecurity experts judged emergency alerts, street video surveillance, and smart traffic signals to be riskier than other technologies in our study. Local officials should, therefore, consider whether cyber risks outweigh the potential gains of technology adoption on a case-by-case basis and exercise particular caution when technologies are both vulnerable in technical terms and constitute attractive targets to capable potential attackers because the impacts of an attack are likely to be great.”(****UC Berkley 2021****)*

Basically, I plan to save and invest 30k a year for 5 years into index funds (from my jobs), and then wait for the bear market cycles in bitcoin. I will then buy it up by selling my stocks and hold for at least a year. 

I’m not setting a goal as to how much, but I assume with the bitcoin pumps if I can catch them over the course of 5 years, it will be enough for me to build my own multifamily rental property of 2-4 units that I pay for in cash with no loans. 

That property would in theory retire me and I’d be 32 and a half maybe 33, and I’d then move to South America where the cost of living is cheaper. 


How doable do you all think that plan is? Will bitcoin provide remarkable buying opportunities in the next 5 years? I hope so

Vivos Inc. (RDGL): Gearing Up to Nuke Cancer with RadioGel

Forget boring old stocks – Vivos Inc. (RDGL) is brewing a radioactive cocktail that could revolutionize cancer treatment, and savvy investors are taking notice. Their secret weapon? RadioGel™, a game-changing hydrogel infused with tiny yttrium-90 microparticles that deliver a targeted punch to tumors, leaving healthy tissue unharmed.

 This minimally invasive approach promises to be:
* More effective: Than traditional radiation therapy, with its collateral damage to healthy tissue.
* Less toxic: No harsh chemicals or surgery, reducing the risk of debilitating side effects.
* More convenient: Outpatient procedure, no need for lengthy hospital stays.

But that's not all. Vivos' RadioGel™ has a secret weapon of its own: the FDA's Breakthrough Device Designation (BDD). This prestigious accolade recognizes RadioGel™'s potential to be a game-changer in cancer treatment, granting Vivos:

* Fast-tracked approval process: Bringing this life-saving tech to patients sooner.
* Enhanced visibility and credibility: Attracting investors, partners, and top oncologists.
* Potential for premium pricing: Recognizing the unique value proposition of RadioGel™.
The BDD is a rocket booster, propelling Vivos towards:
* Expanded insurance coverage: Making RadioGel™ accessible to more patients.
* Widespread adoption by hospitals and clinics: As they see the clear advantages over traditional treatments.
* Exponential revenue growth: As demand for this revolutionary cancer fighter soars.

With a $50 billion global cancer treatment market ripe for disruption, Vivos is poised to grab a significant chunk. Think about it: a company with a cutting-edge technology, regulatory tailwinds, and a massive addressable market. Is it any wonder investors are buzzing?

Vivos Inc. (RDGL) is not just a stock; it's a beacon of hope in the fight against cancer. By investing in Vivos, you're not just making money, you're potentially backing a technology that could save countless lives. Buckle up, because this healthcare revolution is just getting started, and Vivos is at the forefront.

Remember, this is not financial advice, and you should always conduct your own research before making any investment decisions.

Having said that— I am SUPER excited and will be adding to my position. I’ve held this stock for years, as it’s one that I firmly believe in."

Lots of good advice on investing but I'm curious how many people have an idea of how much money you have to start with in order to create more? The cliche goes you have to spend money to make money.

4076,"Bitcoin price volatility might be a thing of the past? I was thinking about how the price has moved since the ETF introduction (lets ignore the 49k to 38k 'dump'). It's been fairly steady, maybe 2-3k up or down over a week......and here we are still at 50-52k ish.

Anyway, it got me thinking about how the ETF's can and probably will try to control the price, make it less volatile and give it steady, slower increases. I mean, they own a massive amount between them (not just in the ETF's), so as the price looks like it's climbing too fast (whatever that may be), they will sell off to try to temper that climb. And will buy aggressively as the price is going down, to try to balance it out. Is this possible? It may require all of the ETF funds to collude together to get it to work, basically one massive whale. I think it's happening already.

My reasoning for it is that they want to give their clients a steady profit each year, much like the V500 fund, and they definitely dont want to see a 70-80% dip during a bear market, like has happened after the last bull runs.

&#x200B;

It'll still be voltaile, compared to many other assets, but the large climbs to crazy heights then massive drop offs will kill the interest in the ETF's i think.

&#x200B;

So, i think this coming bull run might not be anything like what we are hoping and predicting. We may not get past 100k, but we also may never drop below about 80k after that. They will try to stabalise it and create those 10-15% profit cycles, but they will be very predictable (to them in control).

PayPal's growth story is showing a new trend: the number of people signing up for new accounts isn't going up much anymore, but the amount of money moving through PayPal is still on the rise. This is because the folks who already have PayPal are using it more often.

Venmo, which is part of PayPal and popular for sending cash to friends, isn't adding as many new users or seeing more money flow as it used to. So, it looks like PayPal might be hitting a high point for now, where just about everyone who might want an account already has one.

The challenge for PayPal will be to keep its current users interested and spending, while also trying to find new ways to grow. Whether this is just a short pause or a sign that they've reached their limit, we'll have to wait and see. But right now, PayPal's still a big name in how people send and spend money online."

7003,"'The S&P Phenomenon' (why Uber popped when it got added to the list) Last Friday when it was announced that Uber would be joining the S&P 500, shares shot up +5.2% at the Monday open. That’s pretty wild; adding \~$6 billion in market cap just because you’ve been added to another index?

Turns out it’s actually a pretty common thing, often referred to as ‘The S&P Phenomenon’, and there is actually some good reason for it. The two main reasons are probably: 1) The inclusion in ETFs; and 2) Investment Funds with the S&P 500 as their benchmark.

https://preview.redd.it/6tsj50h8d45c1.png?width=2422&format=png&auto=webp&s=c80eb9b6f6eab4347b6c7452b61002b135b57fb7

**Inclusion in ETFs:** When a company gets added to an index, any ETFs that track that index need to go out and buy shares of the company equal to the expected weight that the company would hold at inclusion. As you can see below, the Top 3 S&P 500 ETFs manage around $1.2 trillion dollars. The S&P 500 has a market value of all listed companies of around $41 trillion so the inclusion of Uber - current market cap of $122 billion - would give it a 0.3% weight in the index. That means just the top 3 ETFs alone would need to go out and buy around $3.5 billion of Uber stock relatively quickly. *Which will move the price.*

  

https://preview.redd.it/jk2mt0tid45c1.png?width=1492&format=png&auto=webp&s=d26952360ac62b77efafea67983f6117a08cd503

**Investment Funds with the S&P 500 as their benchmark:** The impact here is pretty much the same as with ETFs; albeit less strict, but potentially larger in impact as the world of mutual funds and other managed equity funds are still much bigger than ETF land. Benchmarks are the most common way to evaluate a fund’s performance, and it sets a goal post for the individual mandate. And in the equity world, the S&P 500 is the biggest benchmark by far.

For a concentrated, say, 30-company fund, not having Uber doesn’t represent much risk of missed alpha, but for a more diversified mutual fund, choosing not to include Uber effectively represents a synthetic short position. If you like the company, then you’d be ‘overweight’ it in your fund (hold more than 0.3% of it). Negative on the company? You might hold less than 0.3%. Can’t decide or haven’t done the work yet? Then it’s better to be market weight until you’ve figured this out so as not to represent a drag on your portfolio.

Moreover, because your mutual fund only gets judged against the S&P 500, going ‘off-benchmark’ to buy a company like Uber before its addition presents increased risk. Even if you liked the company before it got added to the S&P 500, you might still want to avoid it, because if an ‘on benchmark’ company in your fund blows-up, you’d have some explaining to do to your investors/CIO/financial advisors. But if you get blown-up by a company ‘off benchmark’, that conversation is even worse. Adding Uber to the S&P 500 opens it up to potentially a massive amount of new investor capital, now that it’s been sanctified.

To prove I’m not just making this up, above you can see that for the last 14 companies added to the S&P 500 the stock move due to the announcement has been pretty material and averages 3.1%.

4991,"How to use Dev3 to generate ERC-20 tokens without coding Dev3 emerges as an innovative platform that allows people to create ERC-20 tokens effortlessly, even without extensive coding experience. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to harness the power of Dev3 for token creation:

**1. Create a Dev3 project and API key**

The journey begins by establishing a Dev3 project. This essential step is not only easy to use but also cost-effective as it is free. Users can start this process without any prior coding knowledge. Creating an API key grants access to Dev3's robust toolset.

**2. Define the token attributes**

Users can start creating tokens after setting up a Dev3 project. Dev3 offers a simplified and intuitive interface that allows users to enter essential token attributes, including the token name and symbol. These attributes serve as the digital dent of the token within the Ethereum ecosystem.

**3. Specify the token owner**

A crucial aspect of creating the [ERC20 token development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/erc20-token-development/) is designating the owner of the token. Dev3 facilitates this by allowing users to specify the blockchain wallet of the intended token owner. For those starting the token creation process, selecting “My Address” is an easy way to assert ownership. Alternatively, users can choose between their address book, which acts as a contact directory, and their respective wallets.

**4. Implement the trac**

By confirming the token attributes and owner details, users move to the trac deployment stage. Dev3 offers a seamless experience by outlining a precise deployment path in this case. Through their blockchain wallet, which opens in a side window, users must sign the transaction.

Dev3's user-centric approach and easy-to-use interface make it accessible to people with limited coding knowledge. This democratization of token creation allows a broader audience to participate in the exciting world of blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi). Dev3's efficiency in simplifying the complex token creation process ensures that users can effortlessly bring their tokenization ideas to life."

The core personal consumption expenditures price index is expected to show a 0.3% increase, according to economists polled by Dow Jones. On an annual basis, the gauge is expected to have increased 4.7% — the same rate at which it grew in the prior month.

> Stephanie Lang, chief investment officer at Homrich Berg, said there’s a push and pull between a soft- landing scenario that’s driven by strong economic data and the Fed, which is positioning for a tougher tone going forward.
*****
> “Even though the economic data has been strong … the Fed has continued to surprise on the upside in terms of how far they could go with their tightening,” she said. “They’ve made it clear that inflation remains their top priority, and they can do that because the job market has remained so strong, but you know, their ultimate goal is to tighten enough that you see some economic weakness so there’s less inflationary pressure.”

# [Stock futures rise after major averages suffer biggest weekly losses of the year: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/26/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
> U.S. equity futures rose Monday, as traders tried to recover some ground following the worst week of the year on Wall Street. Investors also looked ahead to another big week in retail earnings.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 138 points, or 0.4%. S&P 500 futures were up 0.5%, and Nasdaq-100 futures rose 0.6%.
*****
> The major averages Friday ended the day lower and posted their biggest weekly declines for 2023. The Dow finished lower by 3%, its fourth down week in a row. The S&P 500 lost 2.7% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 3.3% for the week.
*****
> Stocks sank Friday and Treasury yields jumped following a bigger-than-expected increase in the latest reading for personal consumption expenditures, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge.
*****
> The early 2023 rally seems to be fading as investors absorb the minutes of the latest Fed meeting, which reiterated the central bank’s tough stance on inflation, as well as recent comments from Fed officials cautioning interest rates could rise higher and for longer than anticipated.
*****
> “As we head into a seasonally weak period, with bets rising that the Fed may go with a 50bps increase instead of a 25bps in March, though still a minority opinion, the short-term market risk remains to the downside despite three straight weeks of losses,” said Louis Navellier, chairman and founder of growth investing firm Navellier & Associates. “The bears are dusting themselves off after getting sacked in January.”
*****
> Concern over tighter monetary policy and persistent inflation have pushed Treasury yields higher. The 2-year rate on Monday hit its highest level since July 2007.
*****
> In the week ahead, investors will be looking for clues about how inflation is affecting consumers and businesses amid a handful of economic data reports and corporate earnings. Durable goods orders are due out Monday morning. Consumer confidence and the ISM manufacturing survey are also on deck in the coming week.
*****
> In earnings, just 6% of the S&P 500 will report but investors are looking for insight into the consumer with several major retailers, restaurants, some travel and entertainment names as well as food companies set to report. Target, Costco, Lowe’s and Macy’s are some of the big names set to report earnings this week.

3991,"Integrated Cyber Solutions Maximizing the Business Engaged with Cell Signaling (CSE: ICS) To understand the effect of AI on all of us — business government and regular folks, we need to understand the concept of Industry 4.0:

*Industry 4.0 can be defined as the integration of intelligent digital technologies into manufacturing and industrial processes. It encompasses a set of technologies that include industrial IoT networks, AI, Big Data, robotics, and automation.*

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gavwl7rj6q5c1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=30704e608af13834232fd58535d089ab6bd8c812

Put another way, Industry 4.0, which refers to the fourth industrial revolution, is the cyber-physical transformation of manufacturing. The name is inspired by Germany’s Industrie 4.0, a government initiative to promote connected manufacturing and a digital convergence between industry, businesses and other processes.

With the background set; now, how does A.I. fit in?

First, the growth of A.I. According to Next Move Strategy Consulting, the ‘artificial intelligence (A.I.) market is expected to show strong growth in the coming decade. Its value of nearly 100 billion U.S. dollars is expected to grow twentyfold by 2030, up to almost two trillion U.S. dollars.’

Eventually, I will get to the effect of AI on the cybersecurity market, but more context needs to be set. As you know, the same chip has two of A.I. The good and the bad. I would add the ugly, but that would be cheesy. Did it anyway.

There are several ways to proxy this sector. But you have to read to the end. Seriously

**Growth of CyberAttacks**

The [Embroker](https://www.embroker.com/blog/cyber-attack-statistics/) blog states some sobering cyberattack stats;

· Attacks set to double from 2023 to 2025

· Attack detection only .05% in the U.S.

· Cybercrime up 600% since Covid

· cybercrime represents the greatest transfer of economic wealth in history

· 43% of attacks target small businesses

· Only 14% cyberattack ready

Lots more stats. None are very favourable for the cybertargets.

On the positive side,

Generative AI enhances decision-making processes by providing valuable insights, augmenting data analysis, and enabling scenario simulations. Generative AI generates diverse and realistic options and helps decision-makers explore alternative strategies, assess potential outcomes, and make informed choices.

That’s all good, but for investors and interested others, we are more interested in how to stop or markedly mitigate devastating — a relative term — ‘ the needle and the damage done.’ (Neil Young 1972).

Given the massive growth of Cyber attacks noted, the facts are that security responses will be needed for a long time.

How is A.I. used to tackle cybercrime? In cybersecurity, AI is frequently used to distinguish “good” entities from “bad.” AI-powered security systems offer real-time alerts to potential threats and continuously monitor networks, devices, and applications, removing dangerous human delay and response.

In cyber security, artificial intelligence is beneficial as it improves how security experts analyze, study, and understand cybercrime. It improves companies’ technologies to combat cybercriminals and helps organizations keep customer data safe. Most importantly, it can also serve as a new weapon for cybercriminals who may use this technology to sharpen their techniques and improve their cyberattacks. (KnowledgeHut)

How can investors play the sector? It is readily apparent that exposure to this vast market is almost necessary. And since the cyberattack/hack market is hard to monetarily quantify and not directly investable, tech and software defences are the way to go.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uc30rgnl6q5c1.png?width=583&format=png&auto=webp&s=d10454a7ed7198c92f148a6e25d086bf2b6b0226

Look at a nifty junior cyber security company\*\*, Integrated Cyber\*\* **(ICS: CSE)**. The company’s website has a plethora of relevant cybersecurity information regarding the incidence of the cyberattack known as ransomware. Pharma tech company Cell Signaling engaged ICS.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3mw2gqjn6q5c1.png?width=1516&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b0231ddc5f8f7a42d0420428c125e838bbbf897

“We believe that cybersecurity awareness must be continuous and digestible. We live in a world where information is consumed and retained in small bites vs. the traditional annual 4-hour mandatory training class,” said Alan Guibord, CEO of Integrated Cyber. “Cell Signaling Technology understands this value and has seen how we efficiently train their teams without extensive downtime — while maximizing the cyber profile of their business.”

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pbk9wfvo6q5c1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3d3864248e564415306c00112b4c414d5a7fa2fc

Cell Signaling engaged Integrated Cyber to deploy and manage its employee awareness and engagement training service powered by KnowBe4, the world’s largest security awareness training and simulated phishing platform.

Suffice it to say I could drone on for pages on the risks/rewards of robust cyber security. All we know is that is a big, underserviced and is only going to get bigger. Being on the side of the good hats is likely a smart move, and a company such as ICS is a compelling strategy. I will leave the conclusion to this tome to Cell Signaling CEO Hasan Barakat:

“Our scientific data is our company’s lifeline and vital to advancing our work related to supporting cancer research and the use of antibodies,” said Hasan Barakat, Cell Signaling Technology, CISO. “We engaged Integrated Cyber and have improved our security profile by training and empowering our employees to recognize potential cyber threats and act accordingly. Additionally, the increased cyber intelligence is helping our employees and their families remain cyber safe outside of the office.”"

However, the Dow and S&P each logged losing own weeks. All of the major averages remain in the green for the month. The Nasdaq is leading the others with a 6.44% year-to-date gain.
*****
> Investors have been weighing the possibility that the Fed is getting ready to slow the pace of its inflation-fighting rate hikes after economic data last week showed a decline in wholesale prices and retail sales.
*****
> On Friday, investors absorbed comments from Fed Governor Christopher Waller favoring a quarter percentage point rate increase at the next meeting. A Wall Street Journal report Sunday, meanwhile, raised the possibility of a spring pause to rate increases — a sign that the Fed could be nearing the end of its rate hiking campaign.
*****
> “With investors growing more confident on the inflation side, it is clear they are now looking beyond the current hiking cycle, to an eventual pause and potentially even cuts down the line,” wrote Deutsche Bank strategist Henry Allen in a note to clients Monday. “But with investors now priced for good news on inflation, the risk is that if inflation does prove more persistent, then we could be in another bear market rally just as we saw last summer.”
*****
> Markets have priced in a 99.7% chance of a 25-basis point hike, according to CME Group data, which would bring the interest rate to a targeted range of 4.5%-4.75%.
*****
> No speeches from Fed officials are on the calendar ahead of the central bank policy meeting on Jan. 31 and Feb. 1. Investors, however, will monitor another batch of economic data, including the Fed’s preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditure price index, due out Friday.
*****
> In the meantime, earnings reports could keep the market on edge, with about 40% of the Dow scheduled to release their latest financial results and offer more insight into how companies are weathering inflation and interest rates. Some of the big names on deck include Microsoft, IBM, Tesla, Visa and Mastercard.

7369,"Stock portfolio tracker focused on long term investing  Hi guys,

I want to share something that I have been struggling with and found a very difficult solution to. I'm sure this will be very useful for the community, since I'm pretty sure all of us share the same needs.

When I started investing, I quickly faced a problem about how hard it is to track my portfolio.

1. I had a few brokerage accounts so I had to manually go through reports for each account.
2. Most data provided by brokers is very complex and a lot of it redundant if you're not a professional trader.
3. Something that is very vital for a long term investor, such as ""yield on cost"" is unavailable etc.

So I started looking for a good tool to track it. I think I went though like 10 google pages and tried almost all of the existing trackers. Most of them are expensive and don't do the job too good.

Most of them just show the data from the broker + aggregate some generic analytics, I'm not interested in.

So since I'm a software engineer I decided to build a simple tool for myself to simply track the aggregate of my portfolios performance (just the +-% graph). And it already felt more powerful than what I've used before!

So little, by little I started adding new things to it and now it does so many cool things, I haven't seen in any other tracker!

My friends and family love using it already and they gave me a lot of feedback. But I think that it's now the time to show it to a bigger audience to hear even more feedback and make this thing even better!

I'm not good at describing so I'm just going to show you a few screenshots.

If you're interested, you can check it out on your portfolios: [https://bull-hold.com](https://bull-hold.com/)

I don't collect any financial, brokerage data etc. All the website asks for is a CSV file with basic data like transaction date (approximate), number of shares, price, etc.

It's free and I don't have any ads on the website.

Please let me know what you think and if you think that some important feature is missing.

Thanks!

Feb CEO, Graham Arvidson comments, “During the quarter, AVL continued its momentum across a range of activities, including the merger with Technology Metals Australia, advancement of the Australian Vanadium Project, construction of our vanadium electrolyte facility and our VSUN Energy vanadium flow battery initiatives.

The consolidation of the Australian Vanadium Project’s contiguous orebody provides a unique opportunity for a project of increased global significance and unencumbered development potential. We anticipate completion of the merger on 1 February 2024 and look forward to welcoming our new shareholders.

The completion of the construction of AVL’s first vanadium electrolyte manufacturing facility was a major milestone for the Company and we were pleased to successfully and safely execute another segment of our ‘pit to battery’ strategy. The facility’s construction demonstrates AVL’s technical and project management abilities which will underpin the development of the larger Australian Vanadium Project. We were grateful to the Hon. Madeleine King MP for opening the facility with us and to all the other attendees at the event for their support.”"
2359,"Pay Extra to Principal or Not I recently bought a house and have about a 6.5% rate. I can comfortably afford the mortgage payments right now and plan to refinance in 1-3 years assuming that rates drop as expected.

I also plan to sell the property in 3-5 years, although that is not a certainty (I may hold it for longer). 

I have plenty of cash sitting in a HYSA and I’m wondering it it makes sense to pay extra toward the principal each month or even as a lump sum right now. I could obviously invest that capital in other ways, and since I’m expecting that interest rates will drop I wonder if it’s worth doing.

My understanding at the moment is that it kind of doesn’t matter, but I’d appreciate hearing some opinions to the contrary. If I didn’t have conviction that interest rates would drop, I figure it would be sensible to pay off the loan faster. If I had a (much) better rate, I’d think paying it more slowly would obviously be more advantageous.

Does anyone have any advice on this? I’d appreciate any thoughts!"

I guess if you have been following this stock you know the parabolic explosion in the price.  

My question is about Trailing stop losses. 

My usual rule of thumb is that I set a stop loss at 7%, but the volatility in this stock is crazy and this thing can swing 7% in a matter of hours.    
I am wondering what others do with trailing stop losses with such volitility?    


I don't want to get stop out too quickly on a short term market movement and have to pay my taxes on my CG, but I do want to protect my profits.    
I have loosened my stop to 15% currently, but there is no logic to that.

My point being is that lyft can do fine in a bull market, but might even possibly thrive in a bear market🤷‍♂️


So the point of this post was for everyone to challenge, poke holes and rip to shred my thesis of LYFT being resilient in a bull or bear market. And from the comments on here it seems either UBER is extremely overvalued (puts on uber) or lyft is way undervalued?!
There are some valid points here but my thesis remains strong that the taxi industry uber/lyft is as old and tried and true as prostitution, and is here to stay regardless of what the economy does, hence why the poorest places on earth regardless of economy still have taxis, that will one day be replaced or challenged by rideshare such as uber/lyft!

2038,"CZR - Caesars Entertainment 'Research' Was in Las Vegas February 7-13, 2024. Stayed at the Horseshoe (CZR strip property). I have a traditional ""lads' trip to Vegas Super Bowl weekend every year (this was my 6th trip) - extended a bit more this year with the Super Bowl in town.

CZRs ""mid-market' properties

Noticed that the high-end properties (Cosmo, Aria) were hopping and jammed. (note: not CZRs properties). 6-8 craps tables operating Thursday and Friday night, with $50-$100 minimums. By contrast, the CZR properties across the street (Planet Hollywood (PH), Paris, Horseshoe, Linq, Flamingo) were much quieter. For instance, PH only had 3 $15 craps tables on Thursday night.

Tables seemed no busier than previous years at the mid-market CZRs properties. Hypothesis is that the ""gambling / partying"" crowd was priced out this year with the Super Bowl in town.

CZRs Execution Risk

PH's marquee 'Heart Bar' was being renovated and converted to a chandelier / glass bar. The new bar was not ready Wednesday-Thursday-Friday during the day of Super Bowl week. (It eventually opened Friday at midnight). Not a good look to have a marquee drinking/party hangout not ready to go for one of the busiest times of the year.

Craps dealers at Paris (Friday night) and Horseshoe (Sunday night) were a long way from being centre-strip Vegas quality. Odds are ""meh"" and limits are high - there is really no reason to make a gambling trip to Vegas - your local casino likely has better dealers, lower limits, and better odds.

CZRs restaurants

Restaurants (Nobu at Paris, Bugsy/Meyers at Flamingo) were busy and an excellent value. So were the cocktails at Vanderpump (Paris).

Conclusion

Overall, the crew this year was a bit frustrated with the CZRs experience and may look elsewhere for our next strip.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 22nd, 2022.

# **Stocks fall Friday to notch weekly loss, S&P 500 snaps 4-week-long rally - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/18/stock-market-news-live-updates-futures-open-to-close.html)**
*****
> Stocks tumbled on Friday as Wall Street’s summer rally faltered and rate hike fears resurfaced, leading the major averages to end the week on a sour note.
*****
> The S&P 500 slid 1.29% to close at 4,228.48, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 292.30 points, or 0.86%, to 33,706.74. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.01% to settle at 12,705.22.
*****
> For the week, the S&P edged 1.21% lower, while the Dow slipped 0.16%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq closed out the week down 2.62%.
*****
> Friday’s halt in Wall Street’s summer rally came as minutes from the Federal Reserve’s July meeting and comments from St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard indicated that the central bank would likely continue hiking rates in the near term, putting a damper on investors’ hopes of a slowdown.
*****
> Despite the week’s moves, many investors and traders are holding out hope for a bounce back.
*****
> “I wouldn’t expect a complete reversal going back to the June lows or something like that, however, the choppiness we’re seeing today and this week does reflect a lot of the bear case that’s out there,” said FBB Capital Partners’ Mike Bailey. “I think seeing the market trade sideways or seeing a bit of a pause in that rally definitely makes sense based on some of the facts that we’re seeing out there.”
*****
> Meanwhile, Bed Bath & Beyond shares cratered more than 40% after Ryan Cohen dumped his entire stake in the retailer. The move seemed to dampen sentiment among meme stock traders who have bet big on the company in recent months.
*****
> In other news, about a $2 trillion notional value worth of options contracts expired on Friday. Options expirations can add volatility to markets as some holders may be forced to move into their positions.

> # September Almanac: Only 4 NASDAQ Wins in Last 12 Midterm Septembers

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/ae0526fdc81e4647a92654fd01bafc40/ea931548fa046435-aa/s500x750/edd7a611bfd1e3a45544584d8d198310a4e18b80.jpg))**

> Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971), Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 (since 1979). September was creamed four years straight from 1999-2002 after four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble madness. Although September’s overall rank improves modestly in midterm years going back to 1950, average losses widen for DJIA (–0.8%), NASDAQ (–0.8%), Russell 1000 (–1.0%) and Russell 2000 (–0.8%). S&P 500’s average September loss improves slightly from –0.5% to –0.4% in midterm years. Although September 2002 does influence the average declines, the fact remains DJIA has declined in 11 of the last 18 midterm-year Septembers.

> # Total Return vs Price Change Spreads

> As we mentioned in today's Chart of the Day, there can be a wide spread between total returns and price change based on dividend yield. Although it doesn't always make financial sense for a company to pay dividends, they can certainly magnify returns all else equal. Click here to start a two-week trial to Bespoke Premium and receive our paid content in real-time.

> The table below outlines twenty S&P 500 stocks that have seen a high percentage of their returns over the last twenty years come from dividends. The average stock on this list has seen over 80% of their gains over the last two decades come from dividends alone. Although the average stock on this list has only seen a price gain of 61.1% since August of 2002, their average total return when factoring in dividends re-invested has been 278%.

> # Bulls Set a New High

> Bullish sentiment continued its recent run of increases according to the weekly AAII individual investor sentiment survey. Hitting 33.3% this week, bulls are at the highest level since the last week of 2021. That 2022 is nearly 2/3 complete and we still haven't seen a bullish reading over 33.3% tells you how negative investors have been this year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081822-AAII-1.png))**

> Bears also ticked up this week reaching 37.2% versus 36.7% last week. While bearish sentiment has only been below 40% for three weeks in a row, that is the longest stretch of sub-40% readings since the start of the year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081822-AAII-2.png))**

> With more bears than bulls once again this week, the bull-bear spread has now been negative for 20 straight weeks.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081822-AAII-5.png))**

> With both bulls and bears higher, neutral sentiment was the only reading to fall this week. Neutral sentiment dropped 1.7 percentage points from 31.2% down to 29.5%. That was only the lowest reading in four weeks as neutral sentiment sits the closest to its historical average of 31.4%.

> # 10-Day A/D Line Overbought for 15 Days

> In an earlier tweet, we pointed out the elevated readings across 10-day advance decline lines in our Sector Snapshot. Not only is the 10-Day A/D line for the S&P 500 approaching one-year highs (as of yesterday's close), but it has been ""overbought"" for the last 15 trading days.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081722-10-day.png))**

> Going back to the start of our data in 1990, there have only been eight other times in which the S&P 500's 10-day A/D line has been overbought for 15 days in a row or more. The last time such a steak was observed was at the start of 2019 which ended at 22 days. That tied for the March 2016 streak for the longest on record back to 1990. We would also note that other than one streak in the first couple of months of 1991, nearly all of these long streaks with an overbought 10-day A/D line occurred since 2010. In other words, consistently impressive breadth by this measure has largely been a recent phenomenon.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081722-Streak1.png))**

> This is not the only impressive breadth signal we have covered of late. For example, in yesterday's Chart of the Day we highlighted that more than 90% of S&P 500 stocks were above their 50-DMAs. Prior times when we've seen that reading spike above 90% have been followed by strong returns in the months and year ahead. Looking at the past times in which the 10-day advance decline line has been overbought for 15 days in a row, forward performance of the S&P 500 has not been considerably stronger than the norm. From that 15th day, the S&P has risen half the time one week out. One and three month returns are more consistently positive but weaker than the norm on a median basis. In the year after the long overbought A/D streaks listed below, though, the S&P was higher 7 of 8 times for an average gain of 11.1%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081722-Table.png))**

> Below is a chart of the S&P 500 since its 2009 Financial Crisis low. As shown, most of these overbought A/D line streaks have occurred as the index was recovering from some sort of sell off. Only one of them (in early 2018) came about at the time of a notable peak in the index.

> # Moving Averages Putting Up a Fight

> Just as the S&P 500 ran into some resistance yesterday at its 200-day moving average (DMA), we've seen the same pattern play out in a number of commodities. Two of the more high-profile ones have been copper and crude oil.

> Copper fell out of bed in the late spring and early summer, losing a third of its value. Along with the equity market, copper has seen a late-summer rally, but things came to a screeching halt right at the 50-DMA last Thursday. Copper has been down on two of the last three trading days and hasn't been able to trade back above that elusive 50-DMA since.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081722-Copper.png))**

> Crude oil has been just as weak as copper lately, trading in a well-defined downtrend and breaking below its 200-DMA in early August. There was a little bit of a bounce last week, but resistance came into play at the 200-DMA, and after making another lower high, it has since made another lower low.

> When stock, commodity, bond, or any other asset class is in a well-defined downtrend, the first thing they have to do to break out of their funks is clear resistance at key moving averages like the 50 and/or 200-DMA. In the case of copper and crude, they have both recently come up short. The S&P 500, again, is facing some resistance at its 200-DMA, but at least it has managed to clear its 50-DMA which it did in the second half of July.

> # Summer Rally Top: Almanac Aggregate Cycle

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/7e8069b2c2bd4e8de914d770f3d6de87/4c5d67735406068a-67/s500x750/5166d3e30c8566f6c5b3725cdf1409b76e765d5a.jpg))**

> Bear market rally or new bull, the 2022 summer rally looks like its run it’s course. With the summer rally pushing DJIA up 13.5% from the June low with S&P up 17.2% and NASDAQ up 23.3% here’s what we are looking at.

> This impressive comeback rally pushed through technical resistance at the June highs. But our indicators and cycles analysis suggest another leg down that culminates in a lower low or retest of the lows at some point in the weak seasonal period August-October ahead of the midterm election.

> Last week’s inflation numbers were certainly encouraging. But we would like to see further confirmation before moving into the bullish camp. We are bullish for Q4 and 2023 but remain vigilant about the potential for another leg down that either tests the June lows or makes a new low.

> In preparation for the 2023 Stock Trader’s Almanac, we developed this brand-new Stock Trader’s Almanac Aggregate Cycle index (STAAC). STA Aggregate Cycle is a combination of the 1-Year Seasonal Pattern for All Years, the 4-Year Presidential Election Cycle and the Decennial Cycle. In the chart here STAAC is all years, midterm years and second years of decades post-WWII from 1946-2021.

> # Housing Descending

> Updates on Building Permits and Housing Starts were mixed relative to expectations for July. While Building Permits exceeded forecasts by 34K, Housing Starts missed forecasts by 81K falling to the lowest annualized rate (1.446 million) since February 2021. Housing represents a large share of the US economy on both a direct and indirect basis, so its health says about the state of the overall economy, Below we have updated our chart of Housing Starts on an average 12-month basis overlaid on top of recessions. Every recession since the late 1960s has been preceded by a rollover in the average rate of Housing Starts, and usually, the rollover starts well in advance of the recession.

> For the current period, Housing Starts remain right near their highest levels of the cycle, but if you look real closely, you can see that the level peaked three months ago. Looking out over history, there are plenty of other periods where Starts declined for a few months but didn't roll over. In other words, based on what we've seen so far, Housing Starts have yet to show signals of an imminent recession. Based on this month's reading and the readings from a year ago, barring a major rebound, the 12-month average is likely to keep declining in the months ahead. Another factor to keep in mind about the historical relationship between Housing Starts and recessions is that in most cases, the recession didn't usually begin until months after the peak of Housing Starts.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081622-Housing-Starts-12-M.png))**

> Taking a closer look at recent trends, the chart below shows the 12-month average of Building Permits and Housing Starts since the start of 2010. It's easier here to see the decline in Starts over the last few months. Building Permits, meanwhile, have continued to trend higher.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081622-Starts-and-Permits.png))**

> On a single-family basis, though, both Building Permits and Housing Starts have shown signs of rolling over. Single-family Housing Starts have been moving sideways for over a year now and have just recently seen an acceleration in the rate of decline while Building Permits have been trending lower for a full year now.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081622-Starts-and-Permits-Single.png))**

> Finally, the chart below compares the performance of Housing Starts over time to the performance of homebuilder stocks using the iShares US Home Construction ETF (ITB) as a proxy. While the two have tended to track each other over time, over the last couple of months, ITB has rallied while Housing Starts have been dropping. Either the market knows something about future developments in the residential housing market or investors have gotten a little offside in their positioning.

1966,"UK investor – HL , Vanguard or Fidelity? Hi all,

I'm a fairly new UK investor and I was wondering what the pros/cons are of Hargreaves Lansdown, Vanguard and Fidelity for someone like me.

I'll be mostly investing in index funds/ETFs.

I've had an account with HL for a couple of years, more for ease than anything else. However, it's increasingly the case that I see funds recommended that aren't available there.

Is Vanguard better for fund availability, and is it worth opening an account with them for wider scope?

I also have an account with Fidelity from way back when. They also seem to offer a wider range of funds, as well as being open to crypto ETFs (this probably isn't the space for that debate, but I admire their flexibility vs Vanguard's stance). However, I'm put off by their trading fees, which seem high.

I'm aware that HL fees can be high, but as I only really deal in index funds and not stocks, and tend to choose funds with lower ongoing fees, that seems to offset the problem.

Or if there's another platform that is better than all three, I'd be keen to hear about it.

Apologies if this question is duplicated elsewhere – happy to just follow a link if so.

Many thanks in advance."

I've been contemplating this for a while, so I've created a spreadsheet to map out a possible exit strategy.

I have:

* Used 10 ETH as an example of my initial holdings (this is just an example of my holdings, do not DM me scam links lol)  

* Set $12,500 as a bullish prediction for the ETH all-time-high this bull cycle.  

* Outlined an escalating sell strategy, ranging from 5% to 25%.  

* Included values in £, because I'm from the UK.  

* Outlined a reinvestment fund, so that I am ready for the next bear market when it comes.

I invested right at the end of the previous bull market, so this is my first entry into a bull cycle. I want to be ready for it, so please let me know your thoughts on my strategy.

Also, if anybody would like an an adapted version of this table please feel free to DM me. I can switch up the values to create an exit strategy for each coin you hold."
1546,"Are you adding a BTC ETF to your portfolio Now that the new BTC ETF’s are available, are you going to add one to your portfolio, and if so, which one and why? 

Personally, I bought some of Fidelity’s new BTC ETF, ticker FBTC. I bought that one because I already have a Fidelity brokerage account so it was easy to do, and also because it has no fees until after Aug 1st when it will then be 0.25%. 

All the recommendations I hear say that if you are going to buy speculative investments, to put no more than maybe 1-5% of your portfolio into them. 

Edit: Not sure why this post got flagged as low effort? Seems like a good discussion to me. Sure has a lot of replies. Maybe it needs more words in the post? Who knows. Maybe this edit will add some and help.

3028,"people are remarking about ""markets"" lately, but has anyone seen bitcoin dominance excluding stablecoins? pardon my dubious speculation...          

So, typically when bitcoin rises there are periods of altcoin seasons that follow. However, are things ""different"" this time? bitcoin is at 52k. Eth is doing well too, but I don't consider it an altcoin.                

But in the macro aspect of things, we have unemployment reaching lows amid an environment where companies are reluctant to hire and rumored to begin layoffs soon if they have not already...           

Something worth remembering at this point is altcoins are far riskier than bitcoin and every time we've seen money printing, years into the future botcoin rises, while banks shutting their doors results in fast upward movement in btc price action.

Fast forward and BTC hits 45k. Just about the price of my car loan. Cool I'll sell. Then I got lazy. I didn't want to go find my chord to get my ledger into my computer.

So let’s say they put up an end cap of Captain Stevie’s all purpose widgets. And I notice that it’s flying off the shelves, so I look up who makes it and buy up stock in that company before it goes national.

2) satellite offices for venders often go up specifically to work with Walmart. Well, if they are opening up an office, maybe buy that too.

They're not just stealing our savings, they're stealing our future earnings too! It's fucking insane and nobody knows it's happening.

929,"ExxonMobil oil production breakeven in Guyana? Couldn't extract any meaningful figure from their Feb 2024 slides.  
[https://investor.exxonmobil.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1156/exxonmobil-announces-2023-results](https://investor.exxonmobil.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1156/exxonmobil-announces-2023-results)  


Does anyone have a good sense of the breakeven levels? Using Petrobas (PBR) as a reference point i infer that it could be sub $35-$40/bl level, but not confident with my analysis.

And since it's lighter crude, easier on the refinery operators to process. Would be more logical that XOM is selling the production at a PREMIUM over certain WTI or BRENT oil benchmark.

[https://oilnow.gy/featured/just-good-guyanas-crude-oil/](https://oilnow.gy/featured/just-good-guyanas-crude-oil/)

  
Following ExxonMobil’s commercial discovery at the giant Liza field in the Stabroek Block offshore Guyana in 2015, it was confirmed that the oil found is of ‘high quality’. The term “High Quality” is commonly used to refer to crude oil which is sweet (low sulphur content) and light (high API gravity).  This means oil which has been determined to rank higher on the American Petroleum Institute (API) Gravity Scale and determined to be of a low sulphur content.  
**This bodes well for Guyana as sweet light crude is the preferred type from which the highest value petroleum products are derived.** However, it is important to note that the price of Guyana’s crude will be dependent on more than just its quality. More on this later.

This means if you're running a multisig, and you lose just ONE of the seedphrases, you could potentially lose access to your vault. Why? Because your wallet cannot figure what addresses you control if it doesn't have the master xpub (multisig config file)

To avoid this, you NEED to make sure you keep a copy of the master xpub of the multisig and back it up safely.

I pity all those multisig users who end up bricking their computer a few years from now, lose their masterxpub (which was only saved in their watch only wallet) and are unable to reconstruct their multisig vault because theyve lost access to just ONE seedphrase.

Since the advent of ETFs, I believe that BTCs price is the sky’s limit. For instance, take a look at Berkshire Hathaway stock. Berkshire Hathaway is nearly a trillion dollar market cap and is trading at 600k. Bitcoin is already at 1 trillion. 

Warren Buffet refuses to stock split because, at the above price tag, the stock will demand quality investors/holders. According to him, this type of investor that purchases Berkshire Hathaway is a long term/diamond handed holder. 

This can be said of bitcoin as well, especially given the involvements of ETFs. Wealthy, long term stock investors will learn about bitcoin through companies like BlackRock and see the historical returns that out performs any other asset. Now banks are wanting in on bitcoin as well. All of which are unprecedented. 

Like Berkshire Hathaway, soon enough bitcoin will hit 600k. When that happens, what type of investor will it be then? Degen traders like the last 15 years, or long term holders that get bitcoins true value?"

EDIT: I have figured it out, USFR is a FRN (floating rate note) treasury fund, very similar to short term treasuries & repos (MMFs) but it is a different product that *does* naturally pay a little bit more. MMFs are risk free because the price is locked in at $1 par, USFR is a traded ETF so its price isn’t locked (still extremely low risk such as short term treasuries), in consequence, slightly higher yield"

They are massively, and it sounds like successfully, expanding production of SiC materials and devices. Gross margins on materials products seem to be quite good, and the entire SiC industry seems supply constrained at the moment. Yeah, EV production may slow momentarily, but does anyone really doubt the long term trend? I also find it likely that as SiC supply grows and costs come down with the sort of scale Wolfspeed is aiming for, there will be more and more SiC uses found/justified. Translation, TAM for SiC products is massively going up and to the right.

So we have a $4B market cap, well funded company ($2B in deposits from customers, plenty of cash on hand to fund manufacturing expansions, applying for gov funding from CHIPs act now) with proven track record demonstrating success in new 200MM boule height material manufacturing. Wolf is trading at ~4x revenue with near term plans to 4x (and then easily get to 10x) manufacturing capacity. No one said building out manufacturing is easy, but with each passing quarter they demonstrate more and more success on this front. The unique scale they are chasing should make them cost competitive with virtually anyone, and as the US focuses on near-shoring/onshoring critical infrastructure manufacturing, their competitive edge should only solidify.

I brought this up yesterday with DXY and the 10YR Yield being on such an incredible bounce while markets did nothing. This shows accurately how wild that bounce is and how much disparity there is right now. Over the last two days (this was from yesterday) the 10yr moved up higher than it had since June 2022. During June 2022 we saw a 13% drop on SPY. Currently SPY is green over 4 days right now. 

I remain under the bias that its is far too early to short this market… and whenever it is finally time to short this market it is going to drop so fast and heavy that its going to feel like fomo.

Incredibly here on SPY we did not get a new supply today and instead are playing out a really nice bull flag here. 

Currently on SPY 493.76 to 494.38 is our critical resistance area. We did see a small drop in buyers today also. 

We have a nice support area at the daily 8ema and 490.84 supply that I would expect us to bounce off if this retrace continues. 

Bulls need to break through the critical 493.76 to 494.38 resistance area with the support of buyers. 

Bears have a window of opportunity to take this lower and under the daily 8ema support near 490 (projected) tomorrow. IF they can do that we have another potential breakdown to the daily 20ema support near 485 (projected) over the next few days.

Despite intraday weakness today the last 10 minutes of the day once again saved the techicals. Buyers came in to support this upside and we even got a new demand at 4961. 

We did not quite come back down to the daily 8ema support of 4938 today to retest that. We have found some extremely strong support around the 4956-4959 area intraday too. 

Bulls need to bounce and close over the supply of 4974 with buyers returning to break us out and get a new daily demand. 

Bears again have an opportunity here to break under the daily 8ema support of 4938 (projected) to then target the daily 20ema support near 4900 (projected).

I actually am surprised to not see a new daily supply here today on QQQ. We once again saw buyers weaken on QQQ which allowed bears to backtest the daily 8ema support. We for the 2nd day in a row held that support. We however are now back inside the same 416.95-428.17 range that we have traded inside of for the last 13 days. 

Bulls need to use these daily 8ema support bounces to push back over 428.17 and target a new ATHs with proper daily buyer support. 

Bears with this bearish engulfing candle and potential failed breakout here have an opportunity to drop us under 8ema support of 424.9 (projected). This would allow that bigger backtest of the daily 20ema support near 420 (projected).

I mentioned yesterday after we failed to breakout and close over 17701 supply that it was our ultimate resistance to watch and keep an eye on. Today we once again found that level to be resistance. This is now 7 rejections and failures to close over 17701 supply. However, we once again for the third day in a row saw bears fail to close under its daily 8ema support of 17560.

Bulls need to use these daily 8ema support bounces to push through 17701 resistance/ supply and close well over that area with daily buyers supporting the price. 

Bears could use this 7th rejection off 17701 as an opportunity to drop us lower under that daily 8ema support and then target daily 20ema support near 17400 (projected).

After two (Really three) massive days on the 10yr yield we are seeing a major retrace here (unsurprisingly). We came into that critical 4.16% to 4.207% triple supply area and had a really hard rejection. 

The daily 8 and 20ema supports of 4.067% has held so far. 

Bears want to see another bounce off daily 8/20ema support here and run it back to 4.16% to 4.207%.

Similarly here on DXY after the massive two day push we saw a small retrace today. We did not get a new supply and are holding nicely onto 104.083-104.165 which was previously resistance and now is attempting to be support. 

Bulls want to see this back under 103.541 supply minimally.

Bears want to see this hard bounce off 104.083-104.165 and push to that 105.086 demand area.

#[Stock futures fall after latest batch of earnings: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/27/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures fell Friday as investors digested the latest round of corporate earnings, including results from Amazon.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell by 108 points, or 0.3%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures slipped 0.3% each.
*****
> Amazon shares were down about 1% after initially rising following the online retailer’s first-quarter results. Meanwhile, Snap tumbled 18% in extended trading following a revenue miss. Pinterest shares fell 14% after issuing disappointing second-quarter revenue growth expectations.
*****
> The earnings season has been better than expected. Of the 261 S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings, about 80% have reported positive surprises, according to FactSet data.
*****
> Still, some traders expressed skepticism that this earnings season is strong.
*****
> “It doesn’t take us out of an earnings recession. We’re still in an earnings recession. And this calendar quarter, which we are in right now, we are going to see the most intense economic contraction and potentially the deepest earnings contraction of what will be a sequential three quarter decline,” Virtus Investment Partners’ Joseph Terranova said Thursday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.”
*****
> On the more positive side, Intel shares climbed more than 4% after the semiconductor firm beat estimates on the top and bottom lines.
*****
> Investors are coming off a strong trading session for the major averages, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 notching their best day since January. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite jumped 2%, posting its best day since March.
*****
> Those gains come after a better-than-expected report from Meta fueled a rally in tech stocks. Investors appeared to shake off light GDP data that could signal the Federal Reserve’s rate-hiking campaign may soon come to an end.
*****
> On the economic front, traders will watch for the latest personal income and spending data, due out Friday before the open. Economists polled by Dow Jones are expecting core prices to have risen 0.3% in March from the prior month. That’s in line with the prior reading.
*****
> The final reading of the April consumer sentiment data is also set to be released Friday at 10 a.m. ET. It’s expected to show a reading of 63.5, which is the same as the previous readout.

1984,"Best asset management business to hold? I’m in a bit of a predicament. I’m currently trying to decide between the 3 powerhouses to which are:

Blackrock
Blackstone
Berkshire Hathaway 

Yes I do own a world index but I want to get a bit of exposure to asset management companies so my question is, in your eyes which one is the best long term investment?

I know blackrock make their money off of fees associated with holding their ETFs.
I know Blackstone make their money off of private equity and also actively manage funds and if I’m not mistaken, they own a lot of real estate.
Berkshire make their money off of dividends and profits from their investments and companies they actually own.

Did I miss anything else?

So once again, my question is what makes the most sense to invest into as I hear Berkshire being recommended a lot and the other 2 not so much. Is there a reason why or is it all down to preference?

Sorry if this is a stupid question.

Thanks."

2942,"did i just get scammed? how bad did i mess up i feel like an idiot typing this. I was just checking my ledger wallet and saw an NFT recieved message for [stakeether.org](https://stakeether.org/).  I went to the website as i did just finish staking my ETH and saw the thing to enter 24 word pass phrase. i  stupidly typed them but didn't hit enter and didn't hit any buttons and thought to myself  in my sleepy state to check what the internet says first. i closed the  site and confirmed it was a scammy.

i checked my ledger and 4.2 ether was gone. am i that much of an idiot that fell for this? did it just read my keystrokes?

is  there any way to reverse this. fuck i'm so tired from life and this is  just the cherry on top. i was planning my cash out soon.

&#x200B;

edit: thank you for the lovely comments, sarcastic, mean, or otherwise. here is some clarification and answers to obvious questions.  
1) I took a 2 year + break from crpyto news purchases, everything to give me some sanity. i came back because i saw increasing articles on mainstream news about an upcoming bullrun and thought it was time to pull my coins from my ledger to my coinbase account. 

2) mistake 1 - i didn't take the time to read up on recent scams. the nft drop about staking was just pure coincidental bad timing. that dude got lucky and got my shit. be honest and ask yourselves if you are aware of the latest types of scams. they are an amorphous beast.

3) mistake 2 - being bone fucking tired and doing financial shit. I should have gone to bed but told myself to get this one thing done and not have to worry about it tomorrow. well that was the mistake as i wasn't thinking straight. just don't rush i guess is problem i haven't solved yet.

4) scams are not just technical. I'm smart and you are smart but we all do dumb things if we lack exposure. the scam itself isn't just a technical thing but more psychological. if you think you can't fall for it you are wrong. i was overconfident too. 

5) a cold wallet isn't as secure as you think. this gave me a false sense of security and it shouldn't have. the only positive is...

6) i didn't have my eggs in one basket. seriously don't have a single pile in one place. shit happens and backups are SOP.

7) it is just money but it's the loss of plans that sucks more. I believe we all have plans for our funds and when anyone looses a chunk of money all at once there is that realization of how much time you lost and not really money.

8932,"Don't dig for gold, sell shovels - $MVIS This saying arose following the California gold rush of the mid-19th century when it became clear that few prospectors made money panning for gold while the suppliers who sold them shovels and picks profited nicely. How can we apply it to the market today and make some money?

&#x200B;

 

**I. Introduction to ADAS**

This due diligence report aligns with the popular saying ""Don't dig for gold, sell shovels"" concentrating on the Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Autonomous Vehicles sector. The objective is to deliver a strategic overview that encompasses the latest technological advancements, market trends, and investment opportunities within this dynamic field. The strategy involves pinpointing key products and companies in the supply chain poised to benefit from the industry's growth and technological progress.

&#x200B;

**II. Autonomous Driving Technologies Industry Overview**

The ADAS & Autonomous Vehicles industry is undergoing substantial growth and transformation driven by evolving consumer preferences, technological advancements, and regulatory initiatives. These technologies aim to augment road safety, enhance transportation efficiency, and provide superior mobility options. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) leverage a combination of sensors, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning algorithms to perceive the environment and make informed driving decisions. In the USA, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) oversees the regulation of this industry.

Automakers are transitioning from passive safety features to active safety measures by integrating ADAS features such as adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assistance, automatic emergency braking, and blind-spot monitoring. ADAS is categorized into different levels based on the degree of automation, as defined by The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). The race to introduce the first automobile with a level 4 ADAS system is underway, with Mercedes currently offering a level 3 system to consumers. ADAS represents a significant source of subscription-based revenue for automobile Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs).

&#x200B;

**III. Government Regulation**

The regulation of ADAS requirements and standards is overseen by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and other global agencies, with Germany taking the lead in regulatory efforts and the USA closely following. Autonomous vehicles are likely to necessitate multiple sensors (camera, radar, lidar, ultrasonics/sonar) for level 3 and above ADAS features, ensuring a high level of redundancy for safety.

Offering a personal perspective, relying solely on Tesla's pure camera vision is deemed ineffective as evidenced by the increasing number of accidents involving Tesla vehicles when Autopilot is engaged. Environmental factors such as heavy rain, snow, and fog can render cameras useless. However, Elon Musk tends to attribute setbacks to government interference rather than acknowledging the limitations of this approach.

&#x200B;

**IV. Technological Advancements in the Supply Chain**

The ADAS and autonomous vehicle industry has experienced a surge in investments and strategic partnerships, indicating growing interest and confidence in the sector. Established automakers, technology companies, and ride-sharing platforms are actively collaborating to leverage their expertise and expedite the development and commercialization of ADAS and autonomous vehicles.

&#x200B;

**V. Conclusion**

When contemplating investment opportunities in the ADAS and autonomous vehicle sector, it is imperative to identify companies demonstrating technological leadership, robust partnerships, and a clear roadmap for future growth. These companies are positioned to lead innovation and capitalize on market trends and evolving consumer demands.

In summary, the ADAS and autonomous vehicle industry is undergoing a transformative phase marked by increased investment and strategic partnerships. Automakers, technology companies, and ride-sharing platforms are actively collaborating to advance technology, share resources, and expedite the market adoption of ADAS and autonomous vehicles.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Microvision, a LIDAR company with a heavily shorted stock, is poised to become a key player in the autonomous vehicle industry and is projected to capture over 50% of the LIDAR market share once deals are announced next month."
2787,"I think I finally understand bitcoin. It's a silent project that operates in the background. There's no face to it. The founders created it and walked away. It's like an elegant clock set into motion that continues to tick. There's no promise of some complex protocol to come 3, 5, or 10 years down the road. It does what it's supposed to now without self promotion from the founders. Since it doesn't need self promotion to thrive, it doesn't fall victim to the vices of marketing from greedy, charismatic leaders, with overly complex projects. Sure, there's Saylor and Novogratz that sometimes fall into that role. But bitcoin doesn't need them to survive and won't need them when they die. The project works now. It does what it's supposed to and it'll continue to do what it's supposed to. It's the money of the future of our science fiction novels.

There's no Krypto Kris marketing shitty debit cards. There's no charismatic Do Kwon doing a Forbes, Steve Jobs photo shoot with a black t-shirt and a white background. There's no J Powell magically expanding the money supply with a cobol fueled wand, creating a 9 trillion USD balance sheet out of thin air.

BTC takes out the corruption of humans, because the humans that created it stepped away. Sure, people will build corrupt systems around it, but BTC itself is a simple, pure, and elegant vehicle silently ticking away in the background until the ticking becomes so loud that no one can ignore it.

1508,"Judge blocks JetBlue-Spirit merger after DOJ’s antitrust challenge [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/16/jetblue-spirit-merger-block-in-win-for-bidens-justice-department.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/16/jetblue-spirit-merger-block-in-win-for-bidens-justice-department.html)

A federal judge blocked JetBlue Airways purchase of budget rival Spirit Airlines, a major win for Biden’s Justice Department, which sued to stop the merger, alleging it would drive up fares for some of the most price-sensitive consumers.  
  
JetBlue’s proposed $3.8 billion purchase of discounter Spirit would have produced the country’s fifth-largest airline, a deal the carriers said would help them better grow and compete against larger rivals like Delta and United.  
  
The decision, handed down Tuesday by a federal judge in Boston, marks a victory for a Justice Department that has aggressively sought to block deals it views as anticompetitive.  
  
“JetBlue’s plan would eliminate the unique competition that Spirit provides—and about half of all ultra-low-cost airline seats in the industry—and leave tens of millions of travelers to face higher fares and fewer options,” the Justice Department alleged in its lawsuit in March.  
  
Spirit shares plunged after the decision was announced and were down 60%, while JetBlue shares swung between gains and losses.  
  
Neither airline immediately commented on the decision.

JetBlue has said access to Spirit’s similar fleet of Airbus planes would allow it to grow quickly when planes and pilots are in short supply, growth it argues it needs to compete against bigger airlines. Years of previous consolidation left United, Delta, American and Southwest in control of about three-quarters of domestic market.  
  
The decision leaves New York-based JetBlue grappling with next steps, tasking incoming CEO Joanna Geraghty with steering the airline on a new path. Geraghty was announced as successor to CEO Robin Hayes after he said earlier this month that he would retire.  
  
The airline operates in highly congested airspace in New York and other cities, and had planned to use Spirit as a way to gain access to more routes and travelers.  
  
JetBlue planned to remodel Spirit’s yellow planes by removing the branding and seats from the tightly-packed planes to provide more of a full-service model.  
  
Spirit had grown rapidly in recent years by offering cheap fares and fees for everything else from seat assignments to carry-on luggage.

1917,"Reddit Plans to Reserve Shares for Its Big Users in IPO, WSJ Reports Social media platform Reddit plans to sell a chunk of its IPO shares to its platform's users, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.  
It aims to reserve an as-yet-undetermined number of shares for 75,000 of its most prolific so-called redditors when it goes public next month, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.  
The users will have the opportunity to buy Reddit shares at its initial public offering (IPO) price before the stock starts trading, a privilege normally reserved only for big investors.  
The San Francisco-based company, which was valued at about $10 billion in a funding round in 2021, did not immediately respnd to Reuters request for comment.  
Reuters in January reported that Reddit has drawn up detailed plans for its IPO in March. It had filed confidentially for its IPO back in December 2021.  
The IPO market has not yet fully recovered as it has been struggling for the last two years with low volumes while several new entrants trade below their IPO prices.  
Reddit's IPO, which has been in the works for more than three years now, would be the first from a major social media company since Pinterest's debut in 2019.

Or did I do something wrong? The history in my wallet shows where I sent my shib, and the eth, but so far nothing

Please gentle I have no idea as to what I’m doing as you can tell, just trying to learn and have some fun with it

Thanks

Update: it still hasn’t shown up, I can look and see where I sent it to a address, at this point I’m thinking I somehow got hacked or scammed 😞😒"
43,"Facebook And Their 30M Users Privacy Data Scandal (Once Again) I guess you've heard about at least one of the Meta privacy scandals (~~because they apparently don't give a fuck~~).

So, this is one of them: over a decade ago, Cambridge Analytica was accused of paying a researcher to collect data from Facebook, including user names, genders, locations, etc. from around 30M people.

And Facebook had no specific policies to assess the results of their investigation into this case, which was discovered in 2015 but not disclosed until March 2018. They also told to the reporters who were investigating this that they had no evidence from their side.

In 2018 they finally disclosed it and were suited by SEC over this incident and the stock drop. Good news is that they recently decided to pay $100M over this, so if you were investor back then and were damaged you [can check it](https://11thestate.com/cases/facebook-sec-fair-fund) (and also I found out that there were fairly small number of filing so you can get bigger payment due to this).

Anyway, I think even if they are paying something now, its their endless saga of data privacy and at some point people would be fed up with it. But tho Meta is one of the M7 for now and I think they would be even more up with the AI and so on implementation."

1233,"How does stock lending work? So I have a pretty basic understanding of stock lending, I understand why people borrow stocks and what they do with the capital once they get it. But the main thing I don't understand is the risks for the lender. Currently I'm trading just using Wealth Simple, and they didn't really list or explain the risks of lending and it just seems too good to be true. 

They make it seem like it's the easiest little passive income opportunity. They also state that:

""User is protected with cash collateral, your loaned shares are covered at a minimum of 100% with cash collateral so that you're fully protected - even if Wealthsimple or borrower's go under""

Does this mean that the risks of the borrower going bankrupt and the lender loosing money is not a possibility with Wealth simples lenders options?"
1892,"Should I take half of my VOO and invest in higher performing stocks with tight stop loss in place?  For the remaining VOO I am invested in I was thinking of putting a trailing stop loss on most/all of it and then reentering after the dip is over and it's back on the upswing again. This way I would avoid major drops in my VOO and would constantly reinvest back in it once the storm is over. It's already happened to me twice over the last month where I was up about 3k on my existing VOO and then the market tanked and I lost most of my gains. Hopefully this idea will help reduce the negative impact. 

As of right now the stocks that I am eyeing to invest the other half of my current VOO in would be IHG, AWI, VST, and CRH. Once these get stopped out from the trailing stop losses that I set then I would reevaluate whether to add them back in or screen new stocks to replace them with that are at least beating VOO over the long term. Of the past 5 days, one month, 3 months, 6 months, one year and have a smooth uptrend relatively speaking without any major dips When comparing against voo as the benchmark."

Cessatech’s first product and lead asset, CT001, is an analgesic **non-invasive nasal spray** for children aged 1-17 years that experience acute pain or pain related to medical procedures. In the pipeline they have CT002 MRI sedation and CT003 Local gel.  


CT001 is based on more than ten years of clinical experience and has already been proven effective and safe in **a clinical Phase II trial in 50 children** at Copenhagen University Hospital (Rigshospitalet). Almost all (94 percent) stated that they would like to receive this treatment again rather than existing alternatives (e.g., oral solutions or injections). In addition, Cessatech has delivered promising preliminary results in a retrospective study based on approx. **300 medical procedures during** a five-year period in a collaborative study between Rigshospitalet and Astrid Lindgren Children’s Hospital. CT001 is currently finalizing the its late stage clinical program.

My prediction is $150,000 based on the following:

The $69,000 peak of 2021 is the equivalent of $89,700 today.

\*\*\*\*\*ETFs have eliminated novel crypto exchanges who mishandle funds, charge ridiculous fees, or require tedious crypto wallet transfers. Furthermore the Average Joe ""hacked my crypto"" stigma is gone with ETFs. Thus attracting the average Joe and Wallstreet

&#x200B;

4634,"Dumb beginners mistake. Need tips Hey Bitcoin People

I made a stupid beginner's mistake. I started with Bitcoin back in 2021 before the crash happened. I then stopped investing during the crash, as befits a complete beginner. But I still put a little bit in here and there. My average buy in is currently worth 15k less than bitcoin. 


Unfortunately I didn't buy my coins on a platform that allows you to transfer them to a cold wallet. Where I have my coins now I can only buy and sell which doesn't do much in the long run. After all, you want to own the coins. 


Now the question is what is the best way to minimize losses? My idea was to sell 10% of my holdings every day and buy bitcoin again on a new platform so that I can transfer the coins to my cold wallet. I'm trying to use dca to make the highest profit on the sale 

Unfortunately, the whole thing is accompanied by losses as I will now be buying at a higher price. But nobody can know when the next dip is and the halving is imminent.

Are there perhaps ways of making less of a loss? Unfortunately, as far as I know, there is no other way out of this situation. Unless Trade republic allows the transfer of bitcoin to cold wallets out of nowhere"

2858,"On July 12th, 2023 I invested $51900 into 60 different projects at $865 equally into each. Here are the results: Worst performing: LTC (-36%); best performing: HNT (+870%). Edit: I mad ea mistake, HNT is up 550%. Trying to post his on a mobile browser is a terrible experience. Sorry about that! And LTC is down 27%. My god, where did I get this math?

A few notes: Even though I tried to put $865 equally into each project, some were not exactly $865. Some were maybe $850, while others were $870, but the majority were closer to exactly $865. And the total of X and Y coins purchased might actually be off by a few percent because I rounded off some when adding it to my portfolio tracker. I also used many different modes of purchasing the coins to avoid getting hacked and losing it all, from eToro to Binance to Coinbase. Also, some were purchased a few days later but the majority were purchased on July 12th.

Here is a [screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/Z8PRNQE.jpeg) of my portfolio tracker. What I took away from this investment experience is:

1. Diversification is king.
2. This was a huge gamble.
3. I plan on doing this when the market crashes by 75%.
4. **I wish I had DCAed.** I honestly have no idea why I did not. There were times I could have bought the best performing ones at a major discount.
5. Reverse r/CC.
6. Due to a few kings (HNT, SOL... I know it is hated here, RUNE, and INJ), I was able to pretty much 2x my investment.
7. LTC what the hell are you doing?

My advice to you:

1. Do not invest in any of the crypto projects that have already 5x or 10x. They will not retain their value. I have done this many times since 2017, and every project in my portfolio that has done 5x or 10x in the last year has fallen just as much during a bear market.
2. Funnily enough, even though LTC was my worst-performing one, it was actually the most resistant to price crashes during the bear market. At a few times, it was actually up tremendously %wise, but I never sold because the gains were minimal $wise and not worth it at that time, relatively speaking. So even though it was the worst performing, it is actually a good store of value if you do not care about long-term gains.
3. Seriously, do not buy any crypto projects that have already *mooned*."
3862,"Breakthrough Bet: Why Vivos Inc. (RDGL) Could Explode After RadioGel's FDA Nod Yesterday, Vivos Inc (RDGL) announced they have obtained FDA’s hard-to-get Breakthrough Device Designation (BDD).

This is a massive first step to entering the human market. Their treatment has been proven successful  in Animals and killed tumors in dogs,cats and horses. 

The human cancer treatment landscape is about to see a seismic shift, and Vivos Inc. (RDGL) is poised to be at the epicenter. With the recent FDA Breakthrough Device designation for their revolutionary RadioGel technology, RDGL presents a potential gold mine for savvy investors. Before you dismiss it as another ""penny stock gamble,"" consider this: high-risk often equates to high reward, and RadioGel has the potential to disrupt the multi-billion dollar cancer treatment market.

So, what is RadioGel? Imagine a gel packed with microscopic radioactive particles that can be injected directly into tumors. This targeted therapy, unlike traditional radiation, delivers its lethal dose to the cancer cells while sparing healthy tissue. This translates to fewer side effects, potentially improved outcomes, and a ray of hope for millions battling the disease.

Why is this FDA nod a game-changer? Breakthrough Device designation is reserved for therapies with the potential to significantly improve treatment or address unmet medical needs. It fast-tracks the approval process, granting Vivos exclusive market access for a limited time. This head start could be crucial in establishing RadioGel as the go-to option for targeted cancer treatment.

The penny stock factor: Yes, RDGL currently trades at a low price per share. But remember, it's all relative. A small investment now could translate into massive returns if RadioGel lives up to its potential. Imagine the surge if successful clinical trials lead to full FDA approval and widespread adoption. The early birds could reap the rewards.

But isn't there risk? Of course. Every investment carries some degree of uncertainty. However, consider this: Vivos is not some fly-by-night operation. They have a dedicated team of scientists, experienced leadership, and a clear vision. They've already secured partnerships with leading medical institutions and veterinary clinics, showcasing early market traction.

In conclusion, Vivos Inc. presents a unique opportunity. You're not just investing in a stock; you're potentially backing a paradigm shift in cancer treatment. The FDA nod, the disruptive technology, and the penny stock potential all come together to create a compelling proposition. This is not a guaranteed bet, but for those willing to embrace calculated risk, RDGL could be the investment that changes everything."

‘As new supply struggles to catch surging demand growth, nickel prices should strengthen considerably by 2024-2025. This would mirror the dynamics of previous bull cycles. While the timing is tricky to predict precisely, the direction seems clear.

Economic uncertainty has caused some pause from investors, but the continued solid electric vehicle growth will assert itself by year-end. Nickel demand from EVs is expected to triple over the next decade, just in the US. Significant mining and auto/battery manufacturers have aggressively positioned themselves through acquisitions and investments to secure future nickel supply despite the short-term uncertainty. Once the clouds clear, they will ramp up efforts again.’ (Crux investor)

Properties stats and CEO comment bear repeating.

AEMC Nikolai Property [presentation](https://alaskaenergymetals.com/wp-content/uploads/AEMC-Presentations-20231129-V1-Web.pdf).

Nickel makes up 16% of the ten critical metals in an EV battery. It is the number 3 in amount needed. It should be apparent by now that not only is a nickel worth having in your metals/green portfolio section but that Alaska Energy Metals may be that exposure vehicle.

And if you need more? Something for everyone.

1. I often see people's trading set ups and it involves a lot of monitors. I know macbook is the worst option for this as it can connect only to 1 external monitor. My understanding is that people who use a lot of monitors in their set up are mostly doing intraday trading. Is this true?
2. I'm not interested in intraday trading. I'm more interested in swing trading and not gonna do it everyday. I've heard that some people just use ipads for this, nothing too fancy. Is this true as well?

So I’m thinking about getting in with a couple thousand, but there’s things I still don’t get:

-I read many times in this sub that BTC doesn’t “depreciate in value” like fiat, but as I understand it, since its value is tied to fiat (BTC does good when it can be exchanged for more fiat, does bad otherwise), it seems to me that if its value does not go up, inflation will still eat up your investment. So it will only not depreciate if it goes up at a higher rate than inflation? What’s the benefit compared to parking your money in the s&p500?

-it seems to me that the idea of BTC as a currency has been abandoned, and now its seen as a store of value—keeping it until it increases enough in value and then exchange it for fiat. Is that the end game? Or does the community still hope for adoption?

Anyways, hoping get some thoughts on this.

# [Stock futures tick higher with all eyes on June’s inflation report](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/12/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures rose slightly Wednesday as investors awaited a key inflation report that is expected to show a fresh high.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 82 points, or 0.26%. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.31%, and Nasdaq 100 futures gained 0.41%.
*****
> The consumer price index, slated for at 8:30 a.m. ET, is expected to climb by 8.8% in June on a year-over-year basis, according to Dow Jones’ survey of economists. That would be even higher than May’s 8.6% reading, which was the biggest increase since 1981.
*****
> “The market is anticipating that June will be the new peak,” said Lindsey Bell, Ally’s chief markets and money strategist. “The reading is likely to confirm what the jobs report on Friday told us – that the Fed will stick to their aggressive rate tightening timeline.”
*****
> The likely hot reading could prompt the central bank to hike another 75 basis points during this month’s meeting. Last month, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rates three-quarters of a percentage point to a range of 1.5%-1.75% in its most aggressive hike since 1994.
*****
> “The Fed’s credibility will be tested in coming months with the release of inflation numbers and corporate earnings,” said Andy Sparks, head of portfolio management research at MSCI. “The Fed’s recent aggressive actions to bring down inflation also run the risk of overshooting, pushing an economy that had been showing signs of weakness into a full scale recession.”
*****
> Meanwhile, investors will monitor second-quarter corporate earnings as major banks are set to report this week. JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley are slated to post results Thursday before the bell. Delta Air Lines reports before the bell Wednesday.

""What Causes Bear Markets Anyway?

...noticing some deteriorating condition in surrounding economic conditions. They begin to become concerned about the market's ability to make further gains for a while. At each dip, more are willing to take some profits, deepening the dips, whereas the rallies created when bargain hunters do buy the dips are met by an increasing number of investors willing to immediately sell into the strength each time, causing the rally attempts to fail. The repeated whipsaws cause those who are buying the dips to wait for lower lows each time before being convinced it's time to buy. The resulting bearish pattern of lower lows and lower highs convinces still more participants that the market is topping out, the selling increases, and a significant decline gets underway.

The resulting first leg down works off some of the excesses. Wall Street insists that the sell-off has been overdone, that stocks are a bargain (even though they're still selling at levels of significant overvaluation to their fundamental fair value). A rally begins, and lasts for several months, convincing investors that all is well, and they scramble to become fully invested again.

The second leg down usually begins when it becomes clear that the problems that caused the first leg down, rising inflation or falling earnings, or whatever, were real and not short term. Corporations begin to report declining sales and earnings, or the economic numbers show the economy is slowing dramatically. Since the problems are now more obvious and widely recognized, the second leg down brings in more sellers, so reaches a much lower low before becoming short-term oversold, a condition that is followed by yet another ""bear market rally"".

The final leg down begins when that rally also fails. When the market rolls over this time, investors begin to panic at the resumption of their losses and the growing gloom and doom in the financial news. This final panic leg down washes out all the previous excesses and interest in speculative investing, and carries valuation levels all the way down into undervalued territory, the exact opposite of the overvaluation levels at the bull...""

Any help would be much appreciated.

The race to secure lithium supplies for EV production has commenced with GM making an investment into Lithium Americas (LAC) and Ford signing an agreement with Albemarle (ALB) to secure lithium hydroxide for \~3M Ford EVs, positioning the lithium is poised for significant growth.

(Source: [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/albemarle-establishes-strategic-agreement-with-ford-motor-company-301830403.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/albemarle-establishes-strategic-agreement-with-ford-motor-company-301830403.html))

Indicators point to this being the early stages of a commodities super cycle as the lag between commodity price signals and changes in supply is widening.

NILI's Nevada North Lithium Project consists of 243 mineral claims over 1,946 hectares with significant lithium content ranging from 29.1 ppm to 5,120 ppm, including 274 samples of 508 carrying 1,000 ppm Li or greater. 

NILI will be drilling 7 new locations at Nevada North within an extensive surface geochemical covering an area of about 1,700m east-west. The new targets were selected to expand the currently identified lithium deposit to the west and north, as well as to determine continuity between the 2022 holes drilled.

While NILI is still in the early stages, it's well positioned for growth going forward with enough capital to expedite and complete its 2H 2023 exploration programs.

I got into IRBT because it seemed that if Microsoft was allowed to acquire Activision, AMZN should be able to acquire a vacuume company, no issue, right? Right? 

It seemed like the risk to reward was there but I think the moral of the story is: don’t buy garbage companies and expect them to fly up. I have played various other merger plays with good success but this one went against my idea of buying decent companies. **Without the merger, IRBT is still overvalued at current prices.**

If you are still in this, the risks of blockage are higher than I expected because AMZN isn’t willing to play ball. Also, considering AMZN dropped the acquisition price previously, it is possible they will drop it again due to the massive drop in price recently. Good luck to anyone who is still playing this.

1289,"Walmart announces 3-for-1 stock split as shares hover below all-time high Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT) announced that it will conduct a split of its outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of 3:1. The stock split is part of Walmart’s ongoing review of optimal trading and spread levels and its desire for its associates to feel that purchasing shares is easily within reach. More than 400,000 associates participate in Walmart’s Associate Stock Purchase Plan today, which allows eligible associates to buy stock conveniently through payroll deductions and provides a 15% company match on the first $1,800 each year.

“Sam Walton believed it was important to keep our share price in a range where purchasing whole shares, rather than fractions, was accessible to all of our associates,” said Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Walmart. “Given our growth and our plans for the future, we felt it was a good time to split the stock and encourage our associates to participate in the years to come. As Sam said, ‘We’re all in this together. That’s the secret.’”

For more than 60 years, Walmart has been focused on helping people save money and live better, including its 2.1 million associates worldwide. Walmart has focused on creating a path of opportunity for associates by offering good jobs and great careers, with continued investments in compensation, attractive healthcare, financial and educational benefits. As part of the benefits provided to its associates, Walmart has had an Associate Stock Purchase Plan for almost 30 years. Today’s stock split is just the latest action aimed at helping strengthen associates’ financial health.

The shares to be issued in the stock split will be payable after market close on Friday, Feb. 23, 2024, for shareholders of record at the close of business on Thursday, Feb. 22, 2024. Shareholders will receive a distribution of two additional shares of common stock for each share held. Walmart's common stock will begin trading on a post-split basis at the market open on Monday, Feb. 26, 2024, under the company's existing trading symbol “WMT.” The stock split and final ratio were approved by Walmart's board.

The company expects that the stock split will increase the number of shares of Walmart’s outstanding common stock from approximately 2.7 billion shares to approximately 8.1 billion shares.

As a result of the stock split, proportionate adjustments will be made to the number of shares of Walmart's common stock underlying the company's outstanding stock awards and warrants; the number of shares issuable under the company's equity incentive plans and other existing agreements, as well as the exercise or conversion price, as applicable; the company’s common stock dividend; and the company’s authorized buyback programs. The company anticipates filing a Form 8-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission after the effective date to report an amendment to the company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation effecting the stock split and reflecting a proportionate adjustment to the total number of authorized shares of company common stock.

**VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA, January 30, 2024** – Alaska Energy Metals Corporation (TSX-V: AEMC, OTCQB: AKEMF) (“**AEMC**” or the **“Company**”) is pleased to provide a corporate update that highlights the accomplishments made since inception in April 2023 and looks ahead to 2024 plans.           

Alaska Energy Metals Corporation President & CEO Gregory Beischer commented: *“I am very proud of what we have accomplished in just 10 months. We’ve successfully rebranded and recapitalized the Company; no small feat given challenging market conditions. For our Nikolai Nickel project in Alaska, we purchased a large database of historical information, calculated a significant maiden nickel resource, and identified drill targets to test for high-grade mineralization. With all our 2023 drill results now in hand, we will soon publish an updated Mineral Resource Estimate for the Eureka Zone and will receive bench-scale metallurgical test results. With an aggressive drilling program planned at Nikolai in 2024, we believe we will significantly expand the Nikolai Project’s metal inventory. Last year, we also purchased a company that owns a Quebec nickel project, which came with $2.8 million in cash. We have assembled a very strong team and are now executing a comprehensive market awareness program to position us for the next phase of the Company’s growth.”*

## Company Progress:

* Renamed and refocused the company as a nickel explorer centered around two key projects in North America: the flagship Nikolai Nickel project in Alaska, USA, and a secondary project in Quebec, Canada.
* With the assistance of a strong capital markets group, brought in more than $15 million into the Company treasury during very challenging market conditions.
* Purchased an extensive database of exploration information at a bargain price, then recovered a portion of the cost by selling some of the information to a neighbouring claim owner. The dataset, created by prior workers from 1995 to 2012, contains geological, geochemical, geophysical, and drilling information costing tens of millions of dollars. This purchase allowed the Company to accelerate its exploration objectives at very low cost.
* Drill hole information in the purchased database allowed the Company to calculate a maiden Inferred Resource. To date, two deposits situated approximately two kilometers (1.4 miles) apart are included in the Mineral Resource Estimate [(Nikolai Mineral Estimate Technical Report – Document No. RPT 23706-0001. January 5, 2024, Stantec Consulting Services Inc.)](https://www.sedarplus.ca/csa-party/records/document.html?id=6370f367c483429289444c506eadf27b582f2ad9956f57f96717899c8b1a94d3). Together the deposits contain more than 680,000 tonnes (1.5 billion pounds) of nickel with accessory copper, cobalt, chrome, iron, platinum, palladium, and gold. The Company considers this Mineral Estimate to be current. Please refer to the press releases dated [November 20, 2023](https://alaskaenergymetals.com/news/billion-pounds-nickel-maiden-ni43101-resource/) and [January 5, 2024](https://alaskaenergymetals.com/news/ni-43-101-technical-report-for-the-eureka-property/).
* Safely and efficiently executed a drilling program consisting of eight diamond drill holes totaling 4,138 meters (13,576 feet) of core at the Eureka Zone of the Nikolai project. The Company has published results that show strike continuity of 1.2 kilometers (3,900 feet) of a mineralized zone ranging between 200 meters (650 feet) to more than 300 meters (980 feet) true width. Assay results indicate a consistent and homogenous grade of about 0.34% nickel equivalent metal. The Eureka Zone is open in all directions and historical drilling and sampling indicates the potential for the zone to extend 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) or more.
* Performed specialized geophysical surveys to successfully identify high-priority drill targets at the Canwell block of the Nikolai project where high grades of nickel, copper and platinum group elements were sampled at surface.

## Looking Forward:

In 2024, we look forward to the following: 

* We plan to calculate and publish, through a third-party, industry-leading, independent mining consulting firm, an update to the Mineral Resource Estimate that includes information from the AEMC 2023 drill program. We aim to publish the update in Q1 2024.
* Drill core samples have been submitted for metal deportment studies to determine the mineral species in which the various metals in the Eureka zone are contained. Deportment will have a strong bearing on metal recovery rates. Results are expected in Q1 2024.
* After deportment studies are complete, the samples will be subjected to bench-scale flotation testing to determine recovery rates for the metals. Results are expected in Q2 2024.
* We have built a strong marketing team that will work to increase market awareness of the Company around the world, so that we can maximize shareholder returns as we advance Company objectives.
* We intend to raise funds through equity financing to execute an aggressive drilling program designed to significantly expand the Mineral Resource Inventory of the Eureka Zone and to explore for high grade nickel mineralization at the Canwell Block of the Nikolai project.
* Plans are being made to begin exploration at the Angliers-Belleterre project in Quebec.

# [Stock futures rise Thursday as Dow tries to build on record-setting rally: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/13/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures climbed Thursday, boosted by a sharp decline in Treasury yields, after the Federal Reserve pointed to multiple rate cuts in 2024 which pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a record-high close.
*****
> Dow futures added 86 points, or 0.2%. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures gained 0.2% and 0.3%.
*****
> The 10-year Treasury note yield dropped below 4% for the first time since August as traders mounted bets on rate cuts for 2024. The benchmark rate was last at 3.95%.
*****
> The Dow on Wednesday jumped more than 1% to reach a record high above 37,000 after the Federal Open Market Committee indicated it may cut rates three times next year.
*****
> The central bank’s commentary was a “tip of the cap to the fact that we’re on a path to a soft landing — and maybe they will be able to ease policy more than the market expects in 2024,” said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird.
*****
> Mayfield thinks that the market rally from over the past six weeks and following Powell’s comments is now “warranted.”
*****
> “We’re basically priced for perfection,” Mayfield said. “We’re probably at a point where risks are skewed a little bit to the downside in 2024, but a soft landing is certainly in the cards and the Fed’s acknowledgement today does help justify the move in equities.”
*****
> The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also reached fresh 52-week highs on Wednesday. The S&P could soon join the Dow in record territory, as the index 2% away from reaching its best ever close of 4,796.56 reached on in January of 2022. The Nasdaq is 9% away from its closing record and has 10% further to go to reach its intraday record, respectively.
*****
> In extended trading Wednesday, shares of Adobe declined by more than 4% following muted guidance for 2024 earnings and revenue.
*****
> Investors will be keeping an eye on economic data on Thursday. Weekly jobless claims will be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. November’s retail sales and imports data are also due that morning, as well as October’s business inventories report.

625,"Total Reserves of Depository Institutions Total Reserves of Depository Institutions is a potentially very important number that very few are paying attention to, and it could be the catalyst for the next financial crisis.

https://preview.redd.it/s0e25yv2vjjc1.png?width=1314&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a6b20ad2fcf355761301422e7f061e98b64658d

This number was just 10s of billions for all of American history until 2008 when, as part of the relief efforts for the Great Financial Crisis, the Federal Reserve starting paying interest on these deposits.

The total reserves have since ballooned to 3.5T. With a current M2 Money Supply just under 21 trillion, these deposits represent 17% of the total supply of dollars that exist. In other words, nearly 1/5th of the entire supply of US dollars is currently sitting on the sidelines, not circulating.

This is “bottled up” inflation from the GFC and COVID. It’s a ticking time bomb waiting to explode. And it could be set off by something as simple as the rate curve normalizing and the market accepting that 5% rates are here to stay.

In my opinion, this is the primary reason for The Fed continuing to tease the market with the prospect of rate cuts. As long as the yield curve is inverted, this money stays put - that is, bottled up. But as soon as private banks feel they can get a better guaranteed return elsewhere - say, in a 10 year bond - it all comes flooding into the economy, and with it comes a massive new round of inflation.

All of this combined with they came out on top in their long court case AND Gensler (SEC Head) actually praising it during a presentation only a short time prior to taking Ripple to court. To me and perhaps I am way over my head here but it feels like the SEC knew or knows that this token will hold some significant value in the future and wanted to force retail investors out... why you ask? Well, lets say XRP is a more sustainable option to BTC (don't hate on me, I own both) and they do not want to see more crypto investors who go from a $0.50 value to something similar to what BTC is today which is around 30k per owned asset.Would love to hear others thoughts...

# [Stock futures are higher following third straight day of gains for the S&P 500](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/06/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures were slightly higher on Thursday morning as Wall Street looked to build on a modest winning streak.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures ticked up by 98 points, or 0.32%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.23% and 0.32%, respectively. The S&P 500 on Wednesday posted its first 3-day winning streak since late May. The benchmark is on pace for its second positive week in 3 and now sits about 20% off its record high.
*****
> Chipmakers were higher in premarket trading after South Korea’s Samsung posted an 11% jump in profit and 21% surge in revenue for the latest period on strong sales of memory chips. Shares of Micron, AMD and Nvidia were all higher in premarket trading by more than 1%.
*****
> Another notable early mover was GameStop, which popped 9% in premarket trading after the video game retailer said a 4-for-1 stock split was approved by its board. Shareholders at the market close on July 18 will get a dividend of three additional shares for each of GameStop’s Class A common stock, the retailer said. The dividend will be distributed after trading closes on July 21.
*****
> On Wednesday, the S&P 500 posted its third straight day of gains following the release of the June meeting minutes from the Federal Reserve. The broader market index added nearly 0.4%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained more than 69 points, or 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite rose close to 0.4%.
*****
> Central bank officials reiterated a tough stance against inflation, saying another 50- or 75-basis point move would “likely be appropriate” at the July 26-27 meeting.
*****
> Still, many investors found it challenging to trust those gains as recession concerns continue to loom on Wall Street, and as market participants looked ahead to what many expect will be a volatile earnings season this month.
*****
> “Everybody is both emotionally and sort of market level exhausted,” Alli McCartney, managing director at UBS Private Wealth Management, said Wednesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.” “So, I think we still have a summer of watching for what the Fed does, watching for what happens in international policy, watching for the directionality of CPI.”
*****
> On the economic front, traders will parse through the latest reports on weekly jobless claims and international trade that are due out Thursday before the bell. The Labor Department’s official jobs report is due out on Friday.
*****
> “With anecdotes of Tech sector layoffs and hiring freezes, sub-50 readings in the Employment
Components of the most recent ISM Manufacturing and Services surveys, and rising unemployment claims (albeit from extremely low levels), Friday’s Jobs report will hold particular significance,” Credit Suisse chief U.S. equity strategist Jonathan Golub said in a note to clients.
*****
> Meanwhile, Levi Strauss is set to report earnings Thursday after the bell.

7162,"Intermediate Trading vs Day Trading Rather than trading on a very short term basis (day trading) I’m hoping to build a strategy to invest/trade on a higher time frame where I can buy a stock and possibly ride a trend for several weeks/months. Most of the books I’ve read or come across focus on very short term trading techniques. 

Are there any good books you guys/gals would recommend for someone looking to trade on a more intermediate time frame?"

Been dollar cost averaging for a while now. Which is great.  But when do you see going to the grocery store/gas station and using bitcoin to make purchases on the daily? Within the next few years? Ever? Will it just be like gold, where you cash some out, put that money in your bank account and proceed? Or will there be a point where we have Bitcoin accepted everywhere and we have some sort of debit card connected to our Bitcoin accounts and make purchases that way?

Sorry if this is a stupid question. I figure y’all would have some insight into this question. ✌️"
3186,"Opportunity Knocks on a Short Squeeze--Miner MIGI. $CLSK, $RIOT, and $MARA may be looking at an acquisition  It is often difficult to be certain that there is naked shorting going on in a stock, but last week's trading action basically screams heavy shorting.  On Dec. 27, MIGI hit $4.30 and, despite Bitcoin in rally mode, the stock is now just under $2.00 and trading at a $29.7 Million market cap. The company's last Operational Update (January) shows an annual revenue run rate of $84 million (using an average BTC price of $42,500). At the current Bitcoin price of over $51,000 and going to halving, when Bitcoin prices are predicted to go much higher, MIGI's revenue run rate will be way over $100 million for the next 12 months. The current market cap of less than $30 million is clearly out of whack.

**Fidelity reports over 800,000 shares short**\--but that number may not fully reflect the probable naked shorting. Fidelity account holders of MIGi were ""informed"" last Monday that an unknown research firm had initiated coverage with a Sell. The stock immediately started selling off from $2.67 and remained under pressure the rest of the week--with 1 million to 1.8 million shares traded daily. Under closer inspection, the ""research report"" was AI-generated and offered NO analysis and used 12 month old information--including the wrong CEO named and his holdings as of--March 2023---hardly up to date.

NO--given the ACCURATE and Up-to--Date information on MIGI cited below, judge for yourself if MIGI may be an attractive near term play for a rebound fueled by short covering.

Another possible outcome with MIGI, considering its low valuation, is that larger Miners that have benefited from very healthy rallies in their stock, MIGI may be acquired for stock. MIGI has four (4) low cost power sites in Pennsylvania. **Cleanspark ($CLSK), Marathon Digital ($MARA) and Riot Platforms ($RIOT) are potential acquirers (in that order).** An acquisition price of $6 to$8/share would be easily justified....although the price would likely go higher as each month goes by and Bitcoin continues to rise.

***Bullet Blockchain’s Subsidiary, First Bitcoin Capital LLC, Continues to Pursue Unlicensed Violators of Bullet Blockchain’s Intellectual Property***

RENO, NV, Dec. 18, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via [NewMediaWire](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=B_Cu_DdLbSqQmdN_89NzAhlBV1YgbwBe35jms06EiYzvCc8D2H_1xos8tTCupacVpKx-7ECzTK_TCpIHJFO6tHKx76SiYGp1wddDIZFN32o=) – Bullet Blockchain, Inc. (“BULT” or the “Company”), (OTC: BULT), a pioneering software development and SaaS company at the forefront of blockchain technologies and Web 3.0, proudly announces a significant milestone: the successful deployment of 10 licensed Bitcoin ATMs across the state of Georgia as the first stage of its planned deployment and branding of 30 Bitcoin ATM kiosks.

[*As previously announced,*](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=mY1Ji9LGnMlpI9v0W2H3VqbVTK6tBYme1ZU9TT7Fxoq9Ed1GD3qBQrRf1Qchmz3LFnxY9poMTuQGqRhcSfMbRylw1RFsx9M3AFCPEj8WTYXy_RqMQMIyWIY3c6GX1k1qqfm0qZY8G2zlurmPm7OeT9DWhh2kQIz-z0v9H2DGuWRngJPQkTWaCLORfo2-JvnSGus1fR_OriujPR0nB3UJCTnRfdQgDOnDmCZ_UdK9ipFM6kHvO2YUqHluMeptW_VNY4ds1GPsbHMwQxfNDbUCdayU3cfSIwbm7bhQfNRYiWaZwfo8OVFstdsZriyDWKzar0ieGf9Mcc8_6nLmfmSuGbze6TET4kOG3VkguB3Cvtc=) BULT recently completed a strategic transaction to acquire a portfolio of Bitcoin ATMs. With this acquisition, BULT is excited to extend its cryptocurrency offerings and improve accessibility of digital assets for the residents of Georgia. The integration of BULT's IP Portfolio into these Bitcoin ATMs establishes the first licensed Bitcoin ATM network in North America. “We are thrilled to be one of the few publicly traded Bitcoin ATM companies, launching and branding the Bullet ATMs to serve the growing demand,” stated Simon Rubin, Chief Executive Officer of BULT. “With Bitcoin continuing to gain traction as an asset class, Bitcoin ATMs provide a straightforward and accessible way for individuals to participate. We see great potential in the Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area, where diverse communities are increasingly interested in Bitcoin. We are confident that our Bullet ATMs will be well-received within the local community.” This move is in line with the rapidly growing demand for convenient cryptocurrency transactions.

Bitcoin ATMs offer a user-friendly, secure, and convenient means for individuals to buy and sell Bitcoin for cash. Transactions are typically completed within minutes, bridging the gap between traditional fiat currency and digital assets. As cryptocurrency adoption continues to rise, Bitcoin ATMs are poised for a promising future in the United States. Bullet ATMs have become a preferred choice for accessing the Bitcoin market, especially for those seeking alternatives to online brokers or exchanges. Simon Rubin, CEO of BULT, emphasized, “Bullet ATMs provide a practical alternative to online exchanges, making Bitcoin accessible to both seasoned enthusiasts and newcomers alike.”

Bitcoin ATMs have experienced significant growth in the United States, driven by the increasing demand for convenient cryptocurrency transactions.

2807,"Are ICOs much of a thing these days? Me and a business partner are working on a startup and we're a point where we need to raise some capital to keep going. Before we officially start pitching to VC firms or trying o get on those equity share funding sites I was wondering if ICOs actually matter much these days or if they're kinda dead in the water and or still nothing but scammssss. I get the United States me and my business partner would need to file more legal paperwork before we launch as those are considered securities but honestly it's w/e, can't be much more paperwork than selling off equity as is. 

-update-

Yeah after discussion on here and looking at recent ICO drops I'm gonna say no to doing an ICO. the entire field is just way too scammy and we simply cannot and will not tarnish our brand this early on by having it look like some get rich quick scam like most ICOs are. I'm still semi open to the idea but unless we can find a suitable way to differentiate ourself within the space (especially since our company isn't focused 100% specifically on crypto) I'm not gonna bother. Thanks for the responses though"
1266,"Two Big Differences Between AMD & NVDA I was digging deep into a lot of tech stocks on my watch lists and came across what I think are two big differences that separate AMD and NVDA from a margins perspective and a management approach.

Obviously, at the moment NVDA has superior technology and the current story for AMD's expected rise (an inevitable rise in the eyes of most) is that they'll steal future market share from NVDA. That they'll close the gap and capture billions of dollars worth of market share. Well, that might eventually happen, but I couldn't ignore these two differences during my research. 

The first is margins. NVDA is rocking an astounding 42% profit margin and 57% operating margin. AMD on the other hand is looking at an abysmal .9% profit margin and 4% operating margins. Furthermore, when it comes to management, NVDA is sitting at 27% of a return on assets and 69% return on equity while AMD posts .08% return on assets and .08% return in equity. Thats an insane gap in my eyes. 

Speaking to management there was another insane difference. AMD's president rakes home 6 million a year while the next highest paid person is making just 2 million. NVDA's CEO is making 1.6 million and the second highest paid employee makes 990k. That to me looks like greedy president on the AMD side versus a company that values it's second tier employees in NVDA. 

I've been riding the NVDA wave for nearly a decade now and have been looking at opening a defensive position in AMD, but those margins and the CEO salary disparity I found to be alarming at the moment. Maybe if they can increase their margins it'll be a buy for me, but waiting for a pull back until then and possibly a more company friendly President."

I know this is a simpleton analysis based on one data point. But other data points like interest rate used for discounting cash flow also points to market being overvalued.

Most of the gains have come from the tech sector in AI. There is significant chance that AI won't add to earnings in next 2-3 years and the excitement may die down, what if the AI hype become similar to dot com hype, that will lead to a significant discounting of all the AI stocks, isn't it?

I am a long term buy and hold investor, I just re-balance every 30-90 days if there is significant price movement. That said, I try to generate some cash flow by selling far OTM calls and that's where I need some info about future possibilities, and my gut is saying next 12 months, S&P 500 price will be somewhere between 430-500.

**St-Georges Eco-Mining Corp** **(CSE: SX) (OTCQB: SXOOF) (FSE:85G1)** St-Georges develops new technologies to solve some of the most common environmental problems in the mining sector, including maximizing metal recovery and full-circle battery recycling. The Company explores nickel and PGEs on the Manicouagan and Julie Projects on Quebec’s North Shore and has multiple exploration projects in Iceland, including Thor Gold.

The simple premise is that critical minerals — and hopefully all metals — will never cease to be recycled and never see the inside of a landfill. SX is at the cutting edge of that extremely worthwhile development. And a decent-looking chart.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ayan8l5ksgbc1.jpg?width=1343&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8d48e6bb2ec196b3b3ffa357077309b29e5e3ad2

Investors and shareholders should carefully review SX’s recent news; SX’s wholly-owned subsidiary, which SX is spinning out Iceland Resources EHF, and has acquired surface and minerals rights from private landowners on the Elbow Creek Project.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/oppx76elsgbc1.jpg?width=356&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a67d358d69acd6e0e3637eed486e5233f6956614

The final terms of the Spin-Out and determination to proceed remain subject to further tax and securities considerations, and the Company expects to provide a further update to shareholders over the ensuing fiscal quarters.

As well, ‘*SX would proceed with a restructuring transaction (the “Spin-Out”), whereby it would spin out the common shares of its subsidiary St-Georges Iceland Ltd. (the “SX Iceland Shares”), which owns 100% of Iceland Resources EHF, to shareholders of the Company at a ratio yet to be determined, with the intent of listing St-Georges Iceland Ltd. on the Canadian Securities Exchange.”*

This news is big news. The results from rock chip samples range from a tiny 0.01 to almost 140 g/t.

There are many years of exploration, including Teck in 1992–93. Iceland Resources uses historical data and creates new data in its exploration plan. Previous drilling of 32 core holes for 2,439 meters at Thormodsdalur has been added to by Iceland Resources with an additional 1,800 meters in 12 drill holes since 2020.

Herb Duerr, president of St-Georges Eco-Mining, commented: “…***Thordis Bjork Sigurbjornsdottir, President of Iceland Resources, and her team of geologists have provided excellent results.” “…Under Thordis’ leadership, the Company is proving gold exists in Iceland in several areas well outside of our flagship Thor Project.” “These areas are new, virgin discoveries with no previous prospecting other than the extensive stream sampling completed in the early 1990’s.” “… the Company is continuing to leverage its vast proprietary database to prospect and discover new gold zones in Iceland.” “…This newly acquired project added to Thor and our other licenses show real potential for bonanza grade gold and silver,” “…makes for exciting times for our Company.” “…We look forward to receiving the final results of our sampling from this field season and to our 2024 field season’s new revelations.***

*Mineralization is low-sulfidation epithermal veining and brecciation hosted in basalt flows and rhyolite dikes. The mineralization identified has multiple samples assaying from 0.1 to 137 g/t gold and 0.1 to 1,515 g/t silver from float and sub-cropping alteration. Individual zones have been mapped intermittently over 800 meters and 1,700 meters in length and 1 to 6 meters wide at the surface. (SHAMELESSLY TAKEN FROM THERECENT PR*\*)\*

That tome has all the grade percentages for Iceland Resources Elbow Creek Project in approximately 35 holes and chip samples.

***Exploration takes money. SX has money.***

*SX recently closed a non-brokered private placement of 14,259,260 “flow-through” units for $0.135 per Unit, for aggregate gross proceeds of $1,925,000. This cash injection will allow the Company to immediately send a significant amount of historical core samples to be tested for palladium, platinum, rhodium, and other PGEs, obtain the results of the 2023 Spring Campaign and finance a portion of the 2024 planned Spring Campaign. The analysis data is expected to be integrated into the final version of the NI 43–101 report that is currently being prepared.*

**Circular Economy**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1djo5qjmsgbc1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=30d655b00de2836f4d479978045c77e80c56d45c

SX is arguably the poster Company for the concept and practice of an entity employing a Circular Economy, which augments its excellent properties.

The circular economy is a system where materials never become waste and nature regenerates. In a circular economy, products and materials are circulated through maintenance, reuse, refurbishment, remanufacture, recycling, and composting.

I would direct you to the Company’s website if you want the mining/Circular economy minutiae. I have focused on the latest deal, but there are more great properties and initiatives. Droning about drill results tends to cause investors’ eyes to glaze over. It is summarized above.

And how many companies do you know mining in Iceland?"
1114,"Purely in theory, why would anyone ever buy a stock that doesn't pay dividends (in a perfect market)? *Disclaimer: I am quite new to investing/trading and just recently learned about how to value a company and P/E and DCF and so on, so this question may be very stupid.*

So the reason one buys a stock, ignoring voting rights and other such immaterial gains, is because one expects a return on the investment that in a couple years will be higher than the initial investment.

For a dividend stock this is very easy: say the stock has a P/E of 10, so you pay 10$ today for 1$ of todays earnings. So to keep it simple, we assume the company's cashflow is the same as the earnings and the dividends are the same as the cashflow and that there is no growth, your investment will have paid off in 10 years just through dividends.

Now add to that the fact that you usually choose a company that grows in earnings and the fact that you can sell this stock to someone else at a higher price and suddenly your investment will pay off much sooner.

But now take a stock where the company has publicly stated that they will never pay a dividend, such as ACM Research when I was going through one of their SEC filings. In this case no matter if you hold the stock for 1 day or 100 years, no matter if the company's earnings double every year, you will never see a cent of it. In fact, your investment will have lost money through inflation and cost of opportunity.

So why then do people buy these stocks? To sell them to someone else later. Okay. But why do those other ones buy the stock then? To sell them to someone else later. Okay, but... - you get the point? To me it seems like the greater fool theory at work. You always count on there being another fool to buy the stock off of you.

But if this were a perfect market (it's not) where everyone collectively agrees that non-dividend stocks have no value because they won't ever give you a single cent in returns, then nobody would ever buy such a stock off of you, and the stock's price would collapse. It doesn't matter then how much the company may grow in valuation because nobody will ever see a cent from it.

Now this doesn't apply if you count on the company paying dividends in the future after the growth phase, or it doing a share buyback or such things. But that is why I took the example of a company that has stated that it will never do such a thing, such as ACM Research.

So then, why would anyone ever buy such a stock in a perfect market? What am I missing here?

**EDIT: Alot of people don't seem to get that my question is purely theoretical in nature assuming a perfect market. I get that in real-life thongs work differently. That is why I have several non-dividend paying stocks on my watchlist, including the aforementioned one.**

**But I have also been told that shareholders if they have enough voting power can overrule a company's management and successfully demand the payment of dividends. So in that case then that answers the question even in a perfect market.**

**EDIT2:**

**Another excellent point on why people would buy such a stock even in a perfect market:**

> You need to understand that if you own 100% of stocks then you own the full company. If the company is profitable, there will be people interested in owning it, willing to pay a good price for the stock, pushing the price higher. The more profitable the company is, the more people will be interested in owning the company or at least some part of it. If you buy a stock then at some point someone will want to buy it from you because they will want to get their voting rights from 40% to 60%, something like that

**I think my question has been sufficiently answered then. Thank you.**

**EDIT3:**

**Another reason:**

> The one caveat to this would be the potential for a buy-out. Some small companies don't pay dividends, but are likely to be bought out at some point by a larger company for a price that will be returned to shareholders in cash or new equity.

EDIT4: (last one lol)

The work done by Bastion and prior explorers, including soil and rock sampling, surface mapping, and identified several candidate targets for discovering breccia-hosted and iron oxide-copper-gold mineralization. If more exploration is successful, any prospective future Mineral Resources may be processed at Hot Chili's planned processing facilities, described in the company's June 2023 PEA. 

The execution of the option is another move in Hot Chili's consolidation strategy for the Costa Fuego copper project. 

Here's the terms of the Option:

* Cash payment of US$200,000 in 12 months from the grant of the Option to keep the Option in good standing
* Cash payment of US$100,000 to Bastion has been satisfied upon grant and execution of the Option
* Option can be exercised in 30 months of the date of grant 
* If the Option is exercised, the consideration to Bastion to purchase Cometa concessions is:
   * US$2,400,000if the Option is exercised by Hot Chili in 18 months from the grant date, or
   * US$3,000,000 if the Option is exercised by Hot Chili in 30 months from the grant date
* Hot Chili many, subject to applicable regulatory approvals, including the approval of the TSX, elect to satisfy the purchase consideration in cash (100 percent), or cash (50 percent) and ordinary shares of Hot Chili (50 percent) issued at a price per share equal to the greater of (i) the 15-day VWAP at the date of exercise of the Option and (ii) the minimum price permitted by the TSXV

What are people's thoughts on this? I was in on this early and doing ok. Starting to slide a little as we await final FDA approval for the children's version of the device in January. Then adult trials and hopefully approval later in the year.

Thinking of buying in for more given the likely January spike to at least $1, likely more (Femy esque).

Is anyone else still in this? What do you think of it's progress and possible future?

Thanks"
2567,"Capital loss and wash sale rule I am new to stock invensting. I am sure this topic has been discussed plenty of times. I googled the topic quite much but still did not get a clear answer. 

Wash sale rule states: ""A wash sale occurs when an investor sells a security at a loss and then purchases the same or a substantially similar security within 30 days, before or after the transaction.""

I totally get that we cannot buy it within 30 days after the transaction, but I am not clear about the situation when we buy it within 30 days before the transaction. Does this mean if I buy a new stock, and then sell it after three days with a loss, I CANNOT claim a capitial loss since I buy it ""within 30 days"" prior to the transaction (the sale)? I try to use the following hypothetical scenarios (using very popular VTI and VOO as examples) to understand this problem.

Scenario 1:

I bought $10K worth of VTI on Monday, and unfortunately market crashed, and I sold all shares on Thursday with a value of $9K, and then bought VOO with the money and held it for long term. Can I claim a capital loss of $1K?

Scenario 2a:

I bought $10K worth of VTI on Monday, and then market crashed. In order to decrease my average cost, I then bought another $10K worth of VTI on Thursday. But the market was still trending down.  I sold all shares the next Tuesday with a total worth of $17K. I then bought VOO with this $17K, and held it for long term. Can I claim a capital loss of $3K?

Scenario 2b:

I bought $10K worth of VTI on Monday, and then market crashed. In order to decrease my average cost, I then bought another $10K worth of VTI on Thursday. But the market was still trending down.  On Tuesday of the next week, I sold the shares I bought on Monday, with a total value of $8K, but kept the shares I bought on Thursday. I then bought VOO with this $8K, and then held it for long term. Can I claim a capital loss of $2K?

Thank you in advance for any input.

## Upcoming NVDA earnings 

**NVDA's** earnings are being released today (May 25th) After Market Close.

NVDA historically beats earnings **88.89%** of the time, with an average beat on earnings of **74.71%**. 

Conversely, NVDA historically misses earnings **11.11%** of the time, with an average miss of **35.29%**.

By taking a **weighted average** (88.89% for earnings beats, and 11.11% for earnings misses) of the average gains/losses we can arrive at an estimate of how much NVDA will beat (or miss) their earnings by. NVDA has a weighted average EPS beat of **66.41%**, and a weighted average EPS miss of **3.92%.** By adding these weighted averages together we arrive at an estimated **earnings beat of 62.5%.**

Applying this to their earnings estimate we can expect **NVDA** to **beat** their EPS estimate by **62.5%** which would result in a reported EPS of **$2.10 (vs their estimated EPS of $1.29).**"

10004,"The importance of Liquidity From my understanding, financial institutions would benefit from a higher price of XRP (I’ll explain my understanding below). Also, Ripple’s software would be very unattractive to use if the price of XRP is volatile (my personal opinion). Financial institutions and businesses that hold XRP as a bridge currency would face currency risk if the price was volatile. If the value of XRP drops significantly during the time it is held as an intermediary asset, it could result in losses for the parties involved in the transaction. This is why it needs to be stable. 

So why is a higher price better…….

A higher price of XRP can potentially provide more liquidity in the context of using XRP as a bridge currency for cross-border payments. When financial institutions or payment providers use XRP as an intermediary asset to facilitate cross-border transactions, my understanding is that they need to hold an amount of XRP to execute these transactions. (I’m not sure if this is true though with ripple’s ODL solution).

XRP transactions are denominated in drops, which are fractions of XRP. For example, 1 XRP is equivalent to 1,000,000 drops. When XRP's price is higher, the value of each drop is also higher, meaning that a smaller quantity of XRP (in drops) is needed to represent a significant value in fiat currency terms.

With a higher XRP price, financial institutions can hold smaller amounts of XRP to achieve the same transactional value. This reduced quantity of XRP can be seen as a smaller percentage of their total holdings, leading to better liquidity management

In large-value transactions, the act of buying or selling a substantial amount of an asset can influence the market price. Higher XRP prices imply that large transactions require fewer XRP, leading to potentially lower market impact and less price disruption during significant transactions.

Holding smaller amounts of XRP reduces the need for financial institutions to maintain large reserves of the asset, making it easier and more cost-effective to facilitate cross-border payments. This can lead to smoother and more efficient payment flows

A higher XRP price may incentivize more financial institutions and payment providers to adopt XRP in their cross-border payment systems. If they expect the price to appreciate over time, using XRP as a bridge currency could result in potential gains for the institution.

With all this said, I have absolutely no clue what XRP could be worth in 10 years. But, I can only see this going up with more adoption. 

Let me know if anyone agrees/disagrees with this."
1315,"China Evergrande has been ordered to liquidate. The real estate giant owes over $300 billion HONG KONG (AP) — A Hong Kong court ordered China Evergrande, the world’s most heavily indebted real estate developer, to undergo liquidation following a failed effort to restructure $300 billion owed to banks and bondholders that fueled fears about China’s rising debt burden.

“It would be a situation where the court says enough is enough,” Judge Linda Chan said Monday. She said it was appropriate for the court to order Evergrande to wind up its business given a “lack of progress on the part of the company putting forward a viable restructuring proposal” as well as Evergrande’s insolvency.

China Evergrande Group is among dozens of Chinese developers that have collapsed since 2020 under official pressure to rein in surging debt the ruling Communist Party views as a threat to China’s slowing economic growth.

But the crackdown on excess borrowing tipped the property industry into crisis, dragging on the economy and rattling financial systems in and outside China.

Chinese regulators have said the risks of global shockwaves from Evergrande’s failure can be contained. The court documents seen Monday showed Evergrande owes about $25.4 billion to foreign creditors. Its total assets of about $240 billion are dwarfed by its total liabilities.

“It is indisputable that the company is grossly insolvent and is unable to pay its debts,” the documents say.

About 90% of Evergrande’s business is in mainland China. Its chairman, Hui Ka Yan, who is also known as Xu Jiayin, was detained by authorities for suspected “illegal crimes” in late September, further complicating the company’s efforts to recover.

It’s unclear how the liquidation order will affect China’s financial system or Evergrande’s operations as it struggles to deliver housing that has been paid for but not yet handed over to families that put their life savings into such investments.

1380,"Boeing, not Spirit, mis-installed piece that blew off Alaska MAX 9 jet, industry source says Dominic Gates By Dominic Gates 
Seattle Times aerospace reporter

The fuselage panel that blew off an Alaska Airlines jet earlier this month was removed for repair then reinstalled improperly by Boeing mechanics on the Renton final assembly line, a person familiar with the details of the work told The Seattle Times.

If verified by the National Transportation Safety Board investigation, this would leave Boeing primarily at fault for the accident, rather than its supplier Spirit AeroSystems, which originally installed the panel into the 737 MAX 9 fuselage in Wichita, Kan.

That panel, a door plug used to seal a hole in the fuselage sometimes used to accommodate an emergency exit, blew out of Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 as it climbed out of Portland on Jan. 5. The hair-raising incident drew fresh and sharp criticism of Boeing’s quality control systems and safety culture, which has been under the microscope since two fatal 737 MAX crashes five years ago.

Last week, an anonymous whistleblower — who appears to have access to Boeing’s manufacturing records of the work done assembling the specific Alaska Airlines jet that suffered the blowout — on an aviation website separately provided many additional details about how the door plug came to be removed and then mis-installed.

“The reason the door blew off is stated in black and white in Boeing’s own records,” the whistleblower wrote. “It is also very, very stupid and speaks volumes about the quality culture at certain portions of the business.”

The self-described Boeing insider said company records show four bolts that prevent the door plug from sliding up off the door frame stop pads that take the pressurization loads in flight, “were not installed when Boeing delivered the airplane.” the whistleblower stated. “Our own records reflect this.”

NTSB investigators already publicly raised the possibility that the bolts had not been installed.

The account goes on to describe shocking lapses in Boeing’s quality control process in Renton.

The work of the mechanics on the door plug should have been formally inspected and signed off by a Boeing quality inspector.

It wasn’t, the whistleblower wrote, because of a process failure and the use of two separate systems to record what work was accomplished.

Boeing’s 737 production system is described as “a rambling, shambling, disaster waiting to happen.”

If that account of what happened is indeed fully documented in Boeing’s system it should be readily verified by the investigation.

The Seattle Times offered Boeing the opportunity to dispute the details in this story. Citing the ongoing investigation, Boeing declined to comment. Likewise, so did Spirit, the FAA, the Machinists union and the NTSB."

*****
> Stock futures were flat Thursday morning as investors considered what the latest data suggested about the health of the broader economy.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 13 points, trading near flat. S&P 500 futures were little changed, and Nasdaq-100 futures declined 0.2%.
*****
> Those moves come as investors digest new data that shows signs of a potentially weakening labor market. The ADP private payrolls report released Wednesday showed job growth slowed in March. Meanwhile, a Tuesday report showed that the number of available positions fell below 10 million in February — a first in almost two years.
*****
> Over the past several months, investors had cheered signs of economic cooling on the hope that it could push the Federal Reserve to change course on its interest rate hiking campaign. But they are now wondering if the central bank has gone too far in its bid to cool inflation, tightening the economy to the point of an economic slowdown or recession, said Rob Haworth, senior vice president and senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.
*****
> “The market is now becoming more concerned about the ensuing data as opposed to the Fed and trying to pick where the Fed is going to hit peak interest rates,” Haworth said. “Plenty of the Street is thinking, ‘Recession, right?’ The market has to start to price for that, because that’s not where we’re priced, so bad news definitely has to be bad news.”
*****
> Investors will watch Thursday for jobless claims data for more insights into the strength of the labor market. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard is also slated to speak in the morning in Arkansas.
*****
> Thursday will cap off a shortened trading week with the market closed for Good Friday, but investors will still closely monitor March jobs report Friday morning. The labor market has remained hot despite layoffs across tech and financial sectors, making the Fed’s job to combat inflation harder.

1159,"Google rebrands Bard AI to Gemini and launches a new app and subscription Google on Thursday announced a major rebrand of Bard, its artificial intelligence chatbot and assistant, including a fresh app and subscription options. Bard, a chief competitor to OpenAI’s ChatGPT, is now called Gemini, the same name as the suite of AI models that power the chatbot.

Google also announced new ways for consumers to access the AI tool: As of Thursday, Android users can download a new dedicated Android app for Gemini, and iPhone users can use Gemini within the Google app on iOS.

Google’s rebrand and app offerings underline the company’s commitment to pursuing — and investing heavily in — AI assistants or agents, a term often used to describe tools ranging from chatbots to coding assistants and other productivity tools.

Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted the firm’s commitment to AI during the company’s Jan. 30 earnings call. Pichai said he eventually wants to offer an AI agent that can complete more and more tasks on a user’s behalf, including within Google Search, although he said there is “a lot of execution ahead.” Likewise, chief executives at tech giants from Microsoft to Amazon underlined their commitment to building AI agents as productivity tools.

Google’s Gemini changes are a first step to “building a true AI assistant,” Sissie Hsiao, a vice president at Google and general manager for Google Assistant and Bard, told reporters on a call Wednesday.

Google on Thursday also announced a new AI subscription option, for power users who want access to Gemini Ultra 1.0, Google’s most powerful AI model. Access costs $19.99 per month through Google One, the company’s paid storage offering. For existing Google One subscribers, that price includes the storage plans they may already be paying for. There’s also a two-month free trial available.

Thursday’s rollouts are available to users in more than 150 countries and territories, but they’re restricted to the English language for now. Google plans to expand language offerings to include Japanese and Korean soon, as well as other languages.

The Bard rebrand also affects Duet AI, Google’s former name for the “packaged AI agents” within Google Workspace and Google Cloud, which are designed to boost productivity and complete simple tasks for client companies including Wayfair, GE, Spotify and Pfizer. The tools will now be known as Gemini for Workspace and Gemini for Google Cloud.

Google One subscribers who pay for the AI ​​subscription will also have access to Gemini’s assistant capabilities in Gmail, Docs, Sheets, Slides and Meet, executives told reporters Wednesday. Google hopes to incorporate more context into Gemini from users’ content in Gmail, Docs and Drive. For example, if you were responding to a long email thread, suggested responses would eventually take in context from both earlier messages in the thread and potentially relevant files in Google Drive.

As for the reason for the broad name change? Google’s Hsiao told reporters Wednesday that it’s about helping users understand that they’re interacting directly with the AI ​​models that underpin the chatbot.

“Bard [was] the way to talk to our cutting-edge models, and Gemini is our cutting-edge models,” Hsiao said.

Eventually, AI agents could potentially schedule a group hangout by scanning everyone’s calendar to make sure there are no conflicts, book travel and activities, buy presents for loved ones or perform a specific job function such as outbound sales. Currently, though, the tools, including Gemini, are largely limited to tasks such as summarizing, generating to-do lists or helping to write code.

“We will again use generative AI there, particularly with our most advanced models and Bard,” Pichai said on the Jan. 30 earnings call, speaking about Google Assistant and Search. That “allows us to act more like an agent over time, if I were to think about the future and maybe go beyond answers and follow-through for users even more.”

2314,"My company is allowing some staff to buy shares. What do I ask to find out more? My company (private not public) told me today that high-performing staff are being given the option to buy shares in the company.   


The problem I have is that this is being taken out of our bonus, and we have the option to use a fixed percentage of our bonus (25% or 50%) to buy shares.  


On the one hand, I appreciate the ""thanks for your hard work"" offer, but at the same time, this feels like gambling. As far as I know, the company has no plans to go public in the next few years.   


The company is in series B and has so far had 3 rounds of investment since being founded.   


All I knew to ask so far was what happens if I leave. They said they will buy the shares back. Every year they will also have a set period where we can sell them back. So they could technically choose the period in the year when they're at their cheapest I guess. But also since this is a private company, who decides what the shares are worth?  


Please tell me what I need to ask the company to find out more. So far I'm leaning towards a hard ""no thanks"" simply because I don't know enough about the company's financials, or if I get taxed when I sell them back (I'm in Asia), or who controls the price of the shares.

1513,"Ampere vs LightShed: two conflicting outlooks on legacy media streaming services: Disney+, Max, Peacock & Paramount. .........................................

***\*Ampere:***

*Ampere Analysis predicts direct-to-consumer streaming businesses of all major U.S. media companies – sans any sports streaming operations – will achieve consistent profitability within 18 months.*

*In analysis released Wednesday, the firm pegs* ***Disney*** *as poised to get there first (as early as calendar Q1 2024) but followed in short order by* ***Warner Bros***. *Discovery (predicted profitability by Q3 2024), with* ***Paramount*** *and* ***NBCUniversal*** *close on others’ heels (both projected to reach the goal by Q1 2025). It should be noted analysis of NBCU only takes into account U.S.-based Peacock streaming operations and not Comcast’s traditional pay TV-led services or Sky Showtime. And taking sports out of the equation is another significant caveat.*

*Disney, in its most recent earnings report grew DTC revenue 12% year over year to $5.04 billion, while narrowing DTC operating losses substantially to $420 million (compared to $1.4 billion DTC losses in the same period a year prior.) Disney’s DTC operations include Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+. The company in 2023 implemented a broader cost-cutting initiative that included cutting 7,000 jobs globally and put it on track to slash costs by roughly $7.5 billion.*

*“Not only have all the major studio streamers now laid the groundwork for profitability…but they all also look likely to turn streaming direct into significant sources of profit,” wrote Ampere in its report. By 2028, Ampere expects studios will generate between $1 billion and $2 billion in annual EBIT from streaming businesses, based on their current market footprint – with further geographic expansion leading to even greater potential upside.*

*Alongside cost-cutting measures and spending pullbacks Ampere pointed to the embrace of ad-supported products as the second key factor in driving a shift toward profitability. It pegged advertising as a “wild card opportunity” that could generate significantly more growth than currently modeled.*

.................................................................................

***\*LightShed:***

*Analysts at LightShed say “we are even more convinced today than 2018 that legacy media companies are making a mistake and all need to radically alter their streaming strategies.”*

*“All four are laser focused on eliminating streaming losses and shoring up balance sheets rather than growing the most robust and profitable long-term streaming business,” wrote analysts led by Richard Greenfield in a December 19 post.*

*LightShed shared prescriptions for streaming businesses of each media company, some of which it thinks should be shut down altogether – including* ***Peacock***. *The firm noted operating losses for Peacock since launch will come in at more than $7.5 billion at the end of 2023, “with NO obvious path to Peacock ever paying back Comcast’s investment.” LightShed suggested Comcast could shift away from a focus on sports to make Peacock look more like Starz – or possibly merge it with both Starz and Showtime. They also advised the ad-supported version of Peacock could be revamped as a FAST service leaning on NBCU’s TV and film catalog.\**

*For* ***Disney***, *one piece of advice from the firm is to abandon plans for a flagship ESPN direct-to-consumer product and move prime ESPN+* *content to a combined Hulu-Disney+ app; “We believe Disney has to pick one streaming business to focus* *ALL of the company’s energy and resources; in turn, Disney should focus their efforts on the streaming platform where they have full control of the IP/content versus licensing sports rights from third-parties,” wrote the analysts*.

*As for* ***Paramount***, *LightShed doesn’t see “how Paramount+ can earn a compelling payback on the billions of dollars that have already been invested” and would scale back the SVOD right away and reverse course on the integration of Showtime, among other steps. Ultimately the firm expects Paramount will be sold.*

*LightShed also doesn’t have a rosy view of* ***Warner Bros***; *“With the accelerating collapse of linear TV, we simply do not believe Warner Bros. Discovery has the ability to become a leading global streaming competitor with enough scale to drive profitable growth,” the firm stated*.

*The analysts said WBD should rebrand the Max SVOD service as HBO and get rid of content that doesn’t fit the brand (meaning newly integrated assets such as Discovery content and CNN), while keeping Discovery+ as a standalone niche streaming service.*

*Finally, the firm doesn’t see M&A as the answer to media companies’ streaming struggles, as LightShed said it’s too late and companies are “not equipped talent-wise or strategy-wise” to build global streaming services on top of linear TV businesses facing growing headwinds. It also sees regulatory approval as a challenge:*

“*Legacy media companies simply do not have time to wait and hope for M&A as a strategy,” wrote Greenfield. “They must take action to alter their streaming strategies immediately or their stocks will continue to suffer*.”

4950,"Software job isn't enough Hello all,
I'm 25 and I work as a software engineer in the UK pulling in around £2300 per month - £1500 living expenses I invest around £600 per month and keep £200 as a buffer.

Anyway I've realised this isn't enough at the rate bitcoin is growing especially having to start over after selling my 0.1 to clear debt I'm at 0.025 so I've got a job as a food courier in my spare time to throw as much as possible into BTC before 1M bitcoin.

Wish me luck.

685,"155k AUD on NVDL, 2x Leveraged Bull Nvidia. I’m ready for post earnings! Meta bought 10B worth of H100 in Jan 24. 

India bought 500B worth of H100s in Jan 

China is still in a shortage of it but are still buying

Alongside every other government. 

Machine learning is in outstanding demand globally. 

Iris energy bought 816 H100 assuming retail price (unlikely) it’ll be 24.48M

EOS Supercomputer has 4600 H100, min cost 138M. 

There’s just a lot of companies buying up the H100, and that doesn’t include the other products Nvidia offers alongside. 

And that’s just the tip of the iceberg, 

Each H100 is selling for 30,000 > 100,000 USD each and at around $46,000 USD pre owned. 

Surely 2x leveraged NVDA = NVDL will print. 

Like look at $ARM, went up 101% non leveraged common stock. 

If NVDA does goes up even 10% I’d make 20% returns. 
 
Though if NVDA just makes so happens to do 50% that’s 100% growth. 

If it falls negative likely 5% it’ll be a 10% loss and I’ll just hold through next earnings date where it would be a certain upwards trend. 

I had sold my 1x NVDA and bought  NVDL for the same proportion. 

As 100k NVDA is roughly worth 50k NVDL. 

Opportunity cost = worth it."
2445,"Calculating Net Investment/ACB Anyone else do this or find logic in this ideology to keep track of their net investments or am I just misleading myself.

E.g.

I just sold a portion of my apple shares (35 shares) in which I had at an ACB of $95. Equals about $3,330 net investment

The proceeds of the sale at current price ($190) was about $6,600

I used that $6,600 to buy 16 MSFT and 1 AMD. If I now want to note my ACB’s for sake of my net investments I used the $3,330 number as my investment so the breakdown is as follows

16 MSFT = about $3,240 = $202/share
1 AMD = about $90/share

MSFT trading at $410
AMD trading at $178

Essentially since I didn’t add any new cash, and used my gains from Apple would it make sense to use the $202 and $90 as my share values.

Of course on my actual brokerage app it would show ACB according to current market price, this is more for the sake of my own records to know what i’ve put in as net investments.

Thanks!"

# [Stock futures fall slightly as control of Congress is still unclear](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/08/stock-futures-are-little-changed-as-wall-street-awaits-results-of-midterm-elections.html)

*****
> Stock futures were slightly lower — following recent market gains — as results of the midterm elections provided no clear answers about who would control Congress yet.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 123 points, or about 0.4%. S&P 500 futures shed 0.3% and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.3%.
*****
> Stocks are coming off three-straight days of gains into the election, where Wall Street was expecting Republicans to gain ground and block any future tax and spending plans. The Dow climbed 333 points on Tuesday for its third-straight session of gaining more than 1%.
*****
> But control of Congress was not clear. NBC News was not yet projecting control of the House of Representatives with an NBC estimate suggesting Republicans could win 220 seats, which would be a narrow majority.
*****
> In one of the key races that could determine Senate control, Democrat John Fetterman defeated Republican Mehmet Oz for the pivotal Senate seat in Pennsylvania, according to an NBC News projection. Oz had the backing of former President Donald Trump, whose endorsed candidates saw spotty levels of success across the country. Critical Senate races in Georgia and Nevada were unresolved.
*****
> “It looks like the strong Republican win that was anticipated yesterday did not happen, and that reduces the chance of the Congress and the Senate extremely lowering spending of the President,” said Bokeh Capital’s Kim Forrest.
*****
> While the election captivated market attention, investors may want to move on now as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to bring down inflation, potentially tipping the economy into recession.
*****
> The political landscape “will fascinate the Washington chattering class, but for the markets, the focus will shift to whether a recession looms, whether the Fed will end its tightening this winter, and whether a truce and negotiations are possible in the Ukraine war,” wrote Greg Valliere, chief U.S. policy strategist at AGF Investments.
*****
> The market’s recent rally occurred at the front end of a strong seasonal period. Historically, stocks tend to rise after midterm elections and the policy clarity it brings, and the final two months of the year are considered a bullish period for investors.
*****
> Shares of Facebook parent Meta Platforms rose 3% premarket after the social media giant announced it will be laying off more than 11,000 workers. Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he was too optimistic about growth and now needs to streamline the company.
*****
> One stock that weighed on futures was Disney, which fell more than 8% in early trading after the entertainment giant missed estimates on the top and bottom lines for its fiscal fourth quarter.

#[Stock futures rise Friday as Dow tries to build on this week's record-setting rally: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/14/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures climbed on Friday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average looked to add to this week’s gains, which have led the 30-stock average to all-time highs.
*****
> Dow futures rose by 65 points, or 0.1%. S&P 500 futures inched up 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.2%.
*****
> Stocks could see volatile trading as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 go through their respective quarterly rebalances. Once complete, Uber will be part of the S&P 500, and DoorDash and MongoDB will be added to the Nasdaq-100.One concern for this rebalancing is some stocks could end up having outsized weighting going on the indexes.
*****
> The major averages are headed for their seventh straight positive week. As of Thursday, the Dow is higher on the week by 2.8%. The S&P 500 is up by 2.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 2.5% this week. It would also mark the S&P 500′s seventh straight weekly gain, its longest winning streak since 2017. The Dow is also on pace for a nine-week winning streak, its longest run since 2019.
*****
> The S&P 500 could soon join the Dow with its own all-time high. The broad market index is less than 1.6% away from a record close set in January 2022. The Nasdaq is roughly 8% away from its highest-ever close, and about 9% from its all-time intraday high.
*****
> Stocks rallied this week after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday admitted that its efforts to tamp down inflation are taking hold, and indicated three interest rate cuts are coming in 2024, buoying investor sentiment. The November retail sales data that came in stronger than expected on Thursday, following this week’s cooler inflation readings, added to hopes the Federal Reserve could navigate a soft landing.
*****
> “What we heard from Fed Chair Powell was that it’s not about the economy, it’s not about financial conditions, it’s not about the jobs market. It’s about inflation and inflation have been coming down pretty far and fast,” Anastasia Amoroso, chief investment strategist at iCapital, told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Thursday.
*****
> “And if we’re at a point where inflation is 2.7%, by March, that consensus is expecting interest rates are still at 5.5%,” Amoroso added. “That’s a big gap that the Fed can do something about, meaning cutting rates.”
*****
> Treasury yields dropped this week. The 10-year Treasury yield fell to below 4% after topping 5% in October.

# **Major stock averages slide for third week, Nasdaq posts six-day losing streak - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/01/stock-futures-are-flat-ahead-of-key-august-jobs-report-due-friday.html)**
*****
> U.S. equities fell on Friday to cap their third straight weekly decline, after a solid August jobs report failed to ease fears that the Federal Reserve would keep aggressively hiking interest rates to fight inflation.
*****
> After rallying through the morning, the Dow Jones Industrial Average erased a 370-point gain and finished the session lower by 337.98 points, or about 1.1%, at 31,318.44. The S&P 500 fell roughly 1.1% to 3,924.26, its lowest close since July. The Nasdaq Composite declined 1.3% to 11,630.86, recording its first six-day losing streak since 2019.
*****
> All of the major averages were lower to end the week, making it their third negative week in a row after slumping in the final days of August. The Dow and S&P lost roughly 3% and 3.3%, respectively, while the Nasdaq fell 4.2%.
*****
> “There’s still a lot of nervousness around what we’ll see over the next few months,” said Callie Cox, U.S. investment analyst at eToro. “Yes, inflation and the job market are coming back into balance, but at what cost? Markets are still figuring that out.”
*****
> “To make matters worse, the S&P 500 is trapped in the danger zone – below its three big moving averages,” she added. “Those moving averages served as floors up until a few weeks ago. Now, they seem to be ceilings that the index just can’t bust through. The mood has definitely changed. While we may not test the lows of this sell-off again, we also may not reach new highs any time soon.”
*****
> Stocks had been weighed down throughout this week by hawkish comments from Federal Reserve officials signaling that interest rate hikes aren’t going away anytime soon. That’s put traders on watch for a retest of the June lows, especially knowing September is historically a poor month for the market. Some have suggested that if the S&P 500 fails to hold the 3,900 level, those summer lows could come back into play.
*****
> Some investors were briefly comforted on Friday by the highly anticipated jobs report, which showed the economy added 315,000 jobs for the month, just under the Dow Jones estimate for 318,000. Stocks rallied in the first part of the day.
*****
> The unemployment rate rose to 3.7%, two-tenths of a percentage point higher than expectations. The August report is particularly important because it’s one of the last major economic reports the Fed will weigh before it raises rates at its September meeting. This data point could help the central bank determine whether a 75-basis-point hike.
*****
> The last major economic report of note is August CPI on Sept. 13 and is more likely to determine how aggressive the Fed needs to be in the near term.

> In the last 21 years, only Russell 2000 has registered an average gain of 0.03% on the Tuesday after the long Labor Day weekend. DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ have struggled with negative average performance. DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 2000 all have fallen for the last five years on Tuesday. On Wednesday the market’s performance has been varied. DJIA has performed the best, up 71.4% of the time with an average gain of 0.30%. S&P 500 is weakest, up only 47.6% of the time with an average gain of 0.29%. NASDAQ has a better record up 52.4% of the time on Wednesday, but a smaller average gain of 0.26%.

*****

> # Bears Back Above 50%

> In the wake of Jackson Hole and more hawkish than previously expected Fedspeak, the S&P 500 is on pace for its worst week since June. As a result, recent improvements in investor optimism have been entirely given back. The AAII survey of individual investors saw only 21.9% of respondents report as bullish this week. That is the worst reading in two months as the back-to-back declines over the past two weeks total 11.4 percentage points.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/090122-Sentiment-1.png))**

> That was matched with a considerable increase in bearish responses. For the first time since early July, over half of respondents reported a pessimistic outlook for equities. Bearish sentiment's eight percentage point week-over-week increase was the largest since mid-June and the third weekly increase in a row.

> The inverse moves of bullish and bearish sentiment resulted in the bull-bear spread to quickly move down to the worst level since the start of July. That follows a string of readings only a couple of weeks ago in which bears outnumbered bulls by only single digits.

> Given the reversal in the spread, the streak of negative readings presses on. Now at 22 weeks long, it ties the 1990 streak for the second longest on record.

> The AAII survey was not alone in showcasing a much more pessimistic tone of investors. Both the NAAIM Exposure Index and the Investors Intelligence survey also pivoted to more bearish readings. Combining these three results, the average reading on sentiment has fallen back to more than one standard deviation below the historical norm. Although that is not as pessimistic of an aggregate sentiment reading as earlier this year, there have only been a handful of other times going back to the mid-2000s in which the investment community had as negative of an outlook towards the equity market.

> # August Declines All Around the World

> The end of August is here and US equities, as measured by the S&P 500 ETF (SPY), have been on a wild ride. At the mid-month high, SPY was sitting on a 4.3% month-to-date gain, but that has more than entirely been erased as it is on pace to finish the month down closer to 3.5%. The country ETF of each other major global economy that we track in our Global Macro Dashboard is a similar story. Across these countries, on average, they had reached a 3.13% gain at their month-to-date highs, but today they are down an average of 3.5% MTD. Overall, developed markets have faired much worse than emerging market countries with average declines of 4.82% versus 1.24%, respectively. In fact, there are only two ETFs—Brazil (EWZ) and India (INDA)—that are currently positive for the month. Meanwhile, China (MCHI) is unchanged. On the other end of the spectrum, Sweden (EWD) has been the worst performer nearing an 11% decline with a number of other European nations following up with the next worst performance.

> With stock markets around the world giving up the ghost in August, most have moved back below their 50-DMAs or even into oversold territory. There are no country ETFs more than one standard deviation above their moving averages although EWZ and INDA have only moved out of overbought territory in the past week.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/083122-GMD-1.png))**

> As we show in the table above, this year's declines have resulted in the average country ETF falling 24% below its 52-week high. Those declines bring the vast majority of these countries back below pre-COVID highs as well. At the moment, there are only four countries that remain above pre-COVID 52-week highs: Taiwan (EWT), India (INDA), the United States (SPY), and Canada (EWC). This exclusive group would need to fall substantially further to revert back to those prior highs, and as shown in the chart below, each one would also still have support at lows from earlier this year before pre-COVID highs become a technical level worth eying.

> # High Correlation Between Stocks and Bonds

> So far in 2022, stocks and bonds have both sold off, leading investors with a balanced portfolio to experience historically painful drawdowns. Rates have risen, and partially because of this fact, equities have had a tough year. The S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is down 16.0% on a YTD basis, while the iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG) has shed 11.3% of its value. Typically, rates fall alongside equities, as investors shift their capital allocations to safer assets. 2022 has been different, though, and has seen selling in both bonds and equities. This has resulted in a historic level of positive correlation between the ETFs SPY and AGG going back to 2004 when AGG first started trading. Click here to start a two-week trial to Bespoke Premium and receive our paid content in real-time.

> Although the 200-day correlation between stocks (SPY) and bonds (AGG) has been higher once before (in late 2009), the current level remains particularly elevated. The current 200-day correlation sits at 0.87, which signifies a strong positive relationship. In the last 200 days, stocks have moved in the opposite direction of rates on most days, as the market is incredibly focused on the bond market as the Fed transitions from an accommodative to a restrictive stance in the face of higher inflation. Interestingly, the correlation coefficient does appear to be rolling over, moving lower in each of the last 15 trading sessions. Historically speaking, the correlation coefficient has tended to turn negative not long after rolling over, as illustrated by the chart below.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/Stocks-and-Bonds-200-D-083022-2.png))**

> The more we zoom in, the more the rollover becomes clear. The higher frequency measures, such as the 100 and 50-day correlation coefficients, have already moved substantially off of their recent highs, even though they are still elevated relative to history. The 100-day correlation coefficient is now at just 0.70, while the 50-day coefficient is even lower at 0.55, the lowest levels since mid-June and mid-May, respectively. This tells us that the 200-day correlation will likely pull back further, thus giving SPY a chance to gain even as rates rise, and visa-versa. As evidence of this, today SPY is down over 125 basis points even as AGG is up six bps, moving in opposite directions. To make a long story short, bonds and stocks may begin to diverge in terms of performance as the correlation between the two assets begins to roll over. Now you just have to figure out which direction they'll each go!

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/Stocks-and-Bonds-50-D-083022-2.png))**

> The rolling 100-day correlation between stocks and bonds has been over 0.5 (or 50%) for 129 trading days, which is the longest streak since the inception of AGG by a considerable margin. Although the coefficient is declining, the 100-day correlation would need to drop another 0.2 points for this streak to end.

> # Continuing Claims Catching Up

> Initial jobless claims had a strong showing this week as the previous reading was revised lower by 6K to 237K. From that revised level, claims fell another 5K down to 232K marking the lowest reading since the last week of June. That was also handily below expectations which were calling for an increase up to 248K. With another week over week decline, claims have now fallen for three weeks in a row; the longest streak of declines since February.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/090122-Claims-1.png))**

> On a non-seasonally adjusted (NSA) basis, the current week of the year has historically marked the annual low. Assuming that is the case this year, 176.8K is in line with the readings from the comparable week of the year in 2018 and 2019. Although further declines are not out of the realm of possibility, assuming normal seasonal patterns, NSA claims will likely rise from here through the end of the year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/090122-Claims-2.png))**

> Continuing claims are lagged an additional week to initial claims.. While continuing claims remain low having avoided the same degree of upward drift that initial claims have experienced this year, this week's reading did move up to 1.438 million. That marks the most elevated level since the first week of April.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/090122-Claims-3.png))**

> Recently we have been highlighting the ratio of initial claims to continuing claims as a way of showing the disconnect between the two seasonally adjusted readings. In other words, the lack of filter through of initial claims into continuing claims, which can be extrapolated as those filing for unemployment are quickly finding new roles. Although the ratio remains well above the historical norm and especially the range of readings observed since the early 1990s, it has begun to roll over in the past five weeks. As for just how big of a drop it has been, the decline ranks in the bottom 2% of all 5-week moves on record. While that is not to say the overall claims picture (initial claims not turning into continuing claims) has completely turned around, it is a sign that continuing claims have been playing a degree of catch-up.

3657,"$XXII - save the date Analyst Hosted Event to Discuss Refocused Business, Cost Reductions and Turnaround Plan

Buffalo, New York--(Newsfile Corp. - January 12, 2024) - 22nd Century Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: XXII) (the ""Company"" or ""22nd Century""), a biotechnology company focused on utilizing advanced plant technologies to improve health and wellness, today announced that it will host a fireside chat event on Wednesday, January 17, 2024 beginning at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time. The event will be hosted by a covering research analyst and feature interactive Q&A with Larry Firestone, who was appointed Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in December 2023.

Mr. Firestone will address the new corporate strategy to create a lean operating cost structure focused on the Company's tobacco manufacturing and tobacco harm reduction products, return the Company to growth and strengthen the balance sheet to ultimately self-fund the Company's development plans.

""We have made significant progress at 22nd Century in a very short time, demonstrating our shared commitment to streamline the business, reduce costs and position the Company on sustainable growth strategies that can lead to positive cash flows,"" said Firestone. ""We are by no means finished with our efforts, and expect to further reduces costs, pay off our debt and diversify our continuing operations as the year progresses. This will enable the Company to fully focus on the best path to achieving commercial success, particularly with our FDA-authorized VLN® harm reduction products.""

A webcast link to join the live webcast or a replay of the event will be available on the investor relations section of the 22nd Century Group website, at https://ir.xxiicentury.com, under ""Events and Presentations."""

1433,"Could 2024 be Disney's year? *There's so much noise and the narrative is murky, but the upside is note-worthy;*

   *\*****Streaming****: at $90 it seems like the street is valuing streaming at 0 even though it's 2/3s the size of Netflix and it matches Netflix's revenue just before the pandemic. It showed a healthy growth of 12% shrinking losses by a billion. Pushed by ad revenue, Ampere analytics now predicts profitability as early as Q1 2024. More upside comes from Charter which just added millions of subs to their ad-tier Jan-5 and the India merger where all Jio Cinema subs will be offered Disney+ exclusively in India for 5 years.*

   *\*****Experiences****: their cruises reported a 98% occupancy last quarter; Disney is doubling its capacity in the next two years. Park expansions in Hong Kong & Shanghai are already clocking record attendance. Tokyo's expansion is next summer followed by Paris. In Florida, Disney World surged again this holiday clocking its busiest day since reopening on December 29. Disney started selling Magic Keys ""annual passes"" again a few weeks ago and they were all sold out in hours.*

*\*****Content****: ""it can't get worse"" should suffice, but Disney's upcoming slate is better than that. The best tracking for box office projections is done through pre-sales. If presales aren't open yet, we track it with surveys like* [*Quorum.com*](https://Quorum.com)*. Deadpool3, InsideOut2 & Planet of the Apes are tracking on top of their categories very far from release. Deadpool3, Marvel's next film, is impossible to open <120mil with its rare scores. On streaming as well, it boasts a strong slate; they just announced that Percy Jackson (currently running) clocked 26mil views; that's House of the Dragon-level numbers. Disney should dominate 2023 Nielsen's top streamed films list released in the next two weeks.* 

*Plus the argument that bad content will translate to worse park attendance is a falsehood; Disney's content had a terrible decade in the 2000's but the parks flourished. It doesn't make sense that parents and kids stop going to their parks cause an original animated film that year flopped. That may have an effect in a decade, but not short-term.*

*\*****India Merger****: it's looking more and more certain. It will be a merger of equals with equal representation in the board. Regulatory concerns are allayed by the fact that it's a deal with Mukesh Ambani who's well connected and is a close friend of the prime minister, he's know to get things quickly.*

*\*****ESPN****: is back on a growth curve last quarter in all metrics. If the NFL deal goes through, it's a game changer; Peacock's streaming number for the latest play-off proves that and Disney is best poised for the deal with ESPN/Disney having massive footing in both linear and streamer.* 

  *\*****Technicals****: chart looks to have struck a bottom and it recorded a golden cross.* 

&#x200B;

*Of course,* ***linear networks*** *declining is a major overhang; but it's a secular decline pressuring all media companies. It's to be countered by streaming where Disney is positioned best among all legacy media companies.*

[Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 Results](https://investor.elfbeauty.com/news-and-events/press-releases/landing-news/2024/02-06-2024-210530133)

For the nine months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2022:

* **Net sales** increased 80% to $702.8 million, primarily driven by strength in both retailer and e-commerce channels. 
* **Gross margin** increased approximately 400 basis points to 71%, primarily driven by favorable foreign exchange impacts, cost savings and mix, improved transportation costs, and lower inventory adjustments, partially offset by costs associated with retailer activity and space expansion.
* **SG&A** increased $163.1 million to $364.2 million, or 52% of net sales. Adjusted SG&A increased $150.2 million to $329.5 million, or 47% of net sales. The increase in SG&A dollars was primarily due to an increase in marketing and digital spend, compensation and benefits, operations costs, retail fixturing and visual merchandising costs, depreciation and amortization and professional fees.
* **Net income** was $113.1 million on a GAAP basis. Adjusted net income was $152.9 million.
* **Diluted earnings per share** were $1.97 on a GAAP basis. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.66.
* **Adjusted EBITDA** was $193.8 million, or 28% of net sales, up 103% year over year."

All of it is in a taxable brokerage account (Fidelity). Currently only have 2 SCHD and 5.02 O. I think it's a long-term good idea to move SCHD and O to a Roth IRA as these will (eventually) be two of my larger positions going forward (I haven't yet, but I am going to open a Roth IRA with Fidelity).  
  
My question, can I:  
  
just move the 2 SCHD and 5.02 to the Roth IRA when it's open  
  
Or  
  
2. Sell the shares of SCHD and O and move the cash after settlement

*****
> U.S. stock futures were lower Wednesday after a sharp decline in the Nasdaq Composite during the previous session, while traders awaited the Federal Reserve’s release of its policy meeting from earlier this month.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell just 12 points, or less than 0.1%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures traded marginally higher.
*****
> Nordstrom shares jumped more than 9% in extended trading after the retailer surpassed sales expectations and raised its full-year outlook. The retailer experienced a surge in demand from shoppers refreshing their closets for “long-awaited occasions.”
*****
> Homebuilder Toll Brothers also posted quarterly results that beat analyst expectations, sending the stock up more than 3% in the premarket.
*****
> Wednesday’s moves came after downbeat session for the Nasdaq, which tumbled following a warning of slowing growth from social media company Snap.
*****
> The tech-heavy composite fell 2.4% on Tuesday, while the S&P 500 slid 0.8%. The Dow rose by 0.2% in a late-day reversal, despite falling as much as 1.6% earlier in the session.
*****
> Snap’s warning dinged other social media and tech stocks, including Facebook parent Meta, Twitter, and Google parent Alphabet.
*****
> “It tells me how much technology and comm services are still over-owned, right, because they’re the ones that are getting hit the hardest, and for good reason. Snap was really a big surprise for just about everybody,” Stephanie Link, chief investment strategist and portfolio manager at Hightower, said Tuesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.”
*****
> “I think that we’re in just really challenging times. I’ve been saying we’re going to be in a choppy environment all year long because there are so many unknowns,” she continued.

*****

At the May 4 meeting, the Fed hiked rates by half a percentage point, with Chair Jerome Powell saying that inflation is “much too high and we understand the hardship it is causing. We’re moving expeditiously to bring it back down.”

2640,"ETF vs. Mutual Fund, assuming similar investment characteristics I am trying to understand if the touted ETF investment strategy is that much better than a mutual fund strategy with similar characteristics. I realize in some situations, yes, but for a buy and hold approach (not frequent trading) or for an IRA, is it mostly a distinction without much of a difference. 

I understand that ETFs trade real time vs. end of day NAV, but this is not that important for a buy and hold investor.

I think I understand that mutual funds will drive more capital gains distributions and therefore more taxes (or maybe earlier taxes?), but if I am in an IRA or even in a lower income retirement situation, that doesn't matter? If non-IRA/not tax deferred, is that really a big impact?

I understand that ETFs often have lower expense ratios because of lower active management, but can't I find similar low management, roughly equivalent expense ratios for index ETFs or no load index mutual funds?

And I think I understand that both ETFs and mutual funds can enable a capital preservation investment strategy (safety, inflation protection). "

2506,"Ethical Investing - seeking advice on how to buy into industries I support and avoid those I don't I want to invest in industries/businesses I personally support and avoid those I don't. But I also see how the companies that I don't support are perfectly poised to be industry leaders in the fields I do support.

For example, I do not support fossil fuels, but rather want to focus on renewable energy. I say this knowing full well that ExxonMobil or Shell would be first in line to shift their entire business strategy to wind/solar as soon as it becomes the more profitable option.

Same with cannabis and tobacco. I hate cigarettes and fully support cannabis legalization and want to ride that wave up to the top. But I just know Philip Morris is gonna move a significant portion of their production line to cannabis once the government makes it feasible to be the biggest player in that field.

And in terms of defense and arms stocks, I hate guns and war. Yet I know that peace isn't possible without countries arming themselves to the teeth to prevent invasion, and fully support the defense of Ukraine and Israel. Plus, you can't really buy ""peace"" stocks.

Add to this the fact that the majority of desirable index funds and ETFs all include those less-ethical stocks (and crypto which I also hate). I don't see any reasonable way to avoid them without cherrypicking stocks like I'm shopping at the financial equivalent of a health food store.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

# [Stock futures slip as investors await October retail sales data](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/15/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures dipped Wednesday as investors weighed another lighter-than-expected inflation report and looked ahead to retail sales data.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded marginally lower. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures also fell slightly.
*****
> Those moves came after Target reported much weaker-than-expected earnings for the third quarter. The results weighed on futures and sent the stock down more than 13%. Target also warned of a weak holiday quarter.
*****
> Wall Street is coming off a positive session, with the S&P 500 closing up 0.87% on Tuesday and the Dow adding 56.22 points, or 0.17%. The Nasdaq jumped 1.45% and is the only major average on pace to eke out slight gains for the week. The producer price index report, which measures wholesale prices, came in below expectations, which alleviated some of investors’ concerns around inflation.
*****
> Chinese technology stocks were among the best performers Tuesday, with the KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF gaining 9.56% for its best daily performance since March 16. Nine out of 11 S&P 500 sectors rose, led to the upside by communication services and information technology. Both health care and materials posted slight losses.
*****
> Stocks have staged a solid run following last week’s better-than-feared consumer price index report. The S&P 500 last week posted its best weekly stretch since June and all the major averages are on track to finish the month with gains.
*****
> Some investors say a near-term retreat is on the horizon, however.
*****
> “In the short term, the market is very extended and overdue to pull back and digest the recent rally,” said Adam Sarhan, CEO of 50 Park Investments.
*****
> Retail sales due out Wednesday could offer another look at consumer behavior amid inflation.

676,"Other products than options? Hello there,

I'm a German citizen and as of now do not have a broker which offers options on American stock.
Since I want to take part in several earning plays in the near future, I was wondering if I could use other products like knockouts, factor certificates, ""option warrants"" and so on.
What would be the advantages/disadvantages?
Are they also based on IV and Theta, or is the pricing here simpler?

Of course the next step is to sign up to a suitable broker but that's too late for the next weeks.

I appreciate any help.

Edit: I am aiming for ibkr, but my problem right now is how could I realize for example a Straddle/strangle? Can I use the mentioned products?"

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 3rd, 2023.

# **Stocks close higher Friday, Nasdaq notches best quarter since 2020: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/30/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)**
*****
> Stocks rose Friday as Wall Street wrapped up a volatile, but winning quarter that saw more Federal Reserve rate tightening and a mini-financial panic spurred on by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.
*****
> The S&P 500 added 1.44% to close at 4,109.31, while the Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.74% to end at 12,221.91. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 415.12 points, or 1.26%, closing at 33,274.15.
*****
> The market got a boost Friday after the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge showed a cooler-than-expected increase in prices. The core Personal Consumption Expenditures index, which excludes energy and food costs, rose 0.3% in February, less than the 0.4% expected by economists polled by Dow Jones.
*****
> The S&P 500 and Nasdaq were up 7.03% and 16.77%, respectively, for the first quarter. It was the best quarter since 2020 for the tech-heavy Nasdaq. The Dow ended the period with a 0.38% increase.
*****
> For the month, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have gained 3.51% and 6.69%, respectively. The Dow, meanwhile, advanced 1.89% to end March.
*****
> But it hasn’t been a smooth ride. Stocks mounted a comeback in the latter part of March after the month began with the failure of two regional banks, a forced-takeover of Credit Suisse and a flight of deposits from smaller institutions. The government’s backstop of the deposits of SVB, as well as Signature Bank, and the setup of a special lending facility for other banks, helped stem the crisis.
*****
> Primary credit lending totaled $88.2 billion while banks took out $64.4 billion through the Fed’s new Bank Term Funding Program, according to Fed data released Thursday that covered the period from March 22-29. That total of $152.6 billion was down slightly from $164 billion the week before and a further sign the crisis was stabilizing as the month comes to an end.
*****
> The SPDR Regional Banking ETF (KRE) closed about 1% higher on Friday, continuing its comeback from the contagion lows.
*****
> Tech stocks were the big winner this month as investors rotated out of financials. The Technology Select SPDR ETF (XLK) added roughly 10% in March.
*****
> The recent rally is “helping to confirm the market’s perception that the problems that brought the market to a crisis of confidence could very well be contained,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial.
*****
> “The semiconductors, [which] have come to be viewed as an important bellwether for global growth, delivered a strong performance,” she added.

> According to the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2023, the first trading day of April is DJIA’s fourth weakest first trading day of all months based upon total points gained. However, looking back at the last 21 years, in the tables below, we can see DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ have all advanced 66.7% of the time (up 14 of last 21) with average gains of 0.16%, 0.24%, and 0.26% respectively. The Russell 2000 is modestly softer, but it has still been up more frequently than down. Five declines in the last ten years (the largest in 2020) have weighed on performance.

> # April 2023 Almanac: DJIA’s Top Month

> April is the final month of the “Best Six Months” for DJIA and the S&P 500. The window for our seasonal MACD sell signal opens on April 3, the first trading day of the month this year. From our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal on October 4, 2022, through the close on March 27, DJIA was up 6.98% and S&P 500 is up 4.92%. This is below historical average performance largely due to persistent inflation, a tightening Fed, regional bank uncertainties and Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine. But before the “Worst Months” arrive, April’s solid historical track record could help reignite the market.

> April 1999 was the first month ever to gain 1000 DJIA points. However, from 2000 to 2005, “Tax” month was hit declining in four of six years. From 2006 through 2021, April was up sixteen years in a row with an average gain of 2.9% to reclaim its position as the best DJIA month since 1950. DJIA’s streak of April gains ended in 2022’s bear market. April is now the second-best month for S&P 500 and fourth best for NASDAQ (since 1971).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/b9dd041a58d0eb96d2d2545fe5c3dc9e/b74e9c0b6765296b-12/s500x750/908161277efb37ef944b87be92b85dc97511caba.jpg))**

> Typical pre-election year strength does bolster April’s performance since 1950. April is DJIA’s best month in pre-election years (+3.9%), second best for S&P 500 (+3.5%) and third best for NASDAQ (+3.6%). Small caps measured by the Russell 2000 also perform well (+2.9%) with gains in eight of eleven pre-election year April’s since 1979. S&P 500’s and NASDAQ’s single losing pre-election year April was in 1987.

*****

> # Here Come the April Flowers

> It was anything but smooth, but stocks are set to begin 2023 with a solid start, with the S&P 500 up more than 5% for the year with one day to go in the first quarter. Although we continue to hear how bad things are, we’d like to note that these gains came on the heels of a 7.1% gain for stocks in the fourth quarter of 2022. Most investors probably have no idea stocks have done so well, given the barrage of negative news out there.

> Here’s a chart we’ve shared a lot, but it is playing out nicely. If you look at a four-year Presidential cycle, we are in the midst of the strongest period for stocks. In fact, historically, the second quarter of a pre-election year is up a solid 4.8% on average and higher 72.2% of the time. Given the overall negative sentiment, an economy that continues to defy the skeptics, and this positive seasonality, we’d be open to a continuation of the rally off the October lows last year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blog-132.png))**

> Take one more look at the above. Last quarter was higher, making that 18 out of 19 times that stocks gained in the first quarter of a pre-election year.

> Turning to April, turns out stocks have historically been higher this month during a pre-election year an incredible 17 out of 18 times since 1950, with only a 1.2% drop back in 1987, the only blemish. As you can see below, only January has a higher average return during a pre-election year, which played out this year with a huge 6.2% gain in January 2023. Why is April usually strong? It could be a combination of springtime buying, good riddance to winter, or putting tax refunds to work. But the bottom line is that this is something we’d rather know than ignore.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blog-245.png))**

> But it isn’t just pre-election years when April does well. Since 1950, it is the second-best month (only November is better); for the past 10 years, it ranks fourth, and for the past 20 years, it has been the best month of the year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blog-319.png))**

> The elephant in the room is that April last year was terrible, with the S&P 500 down 8.8%, for the worst April since 1970. Of course, back then, the start of the war, higher inflation fears, a Fed just starting to hike, and economic worries lead to the historic drop.

> We remain overweight stocks and expect the lowered expectations amid a better economy to have the potential to drive higher stock prices in 2023, with gains that could reach between 12-15% this year.

> # Sentiment Still Bearish...Or Is It?

> The S&P 500 has made a press back up towards the high end of the past month's range this week, but sentiment has yet to reflect the moves higher in price. The past several weeks have seen the AAII sentiment survey come in a relatively tight range between the high of 24.8% on March 9th and a low of 19.2% the following week. That is in spite of the recent updates to monetary policy and turbulence in the banking industry. Today's reading was smack dab in the middle of that recent range at 22.5%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/033023-Sentiment-1.png))**

> Given there have not been any major developments with regard to sentiment, the record streak of below-average (37.55%) bullish sentiment readings has grown to 71 weeks.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/033023-Sentiment-1a.png))**

> While bullish sentiment was modestly higher this week rising 1.6 percentage points, bearish sentiment shed 3.3 percentage points to fall to 45.6%. That is only the lowest reading in three weeks as bearish sentiment has sat above 40% for all of March.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/033023-Sentiment-2.png))**

> The predominant sentiment reading continues to be bearish. The bull-bear spread has been negative for six weeks in a row following the end of the record streak of negative readings in the bull-bear spread in February.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/033023-Sentiment-3.png))**

> Taking into account other sentiment surveys, the AAII reading stands out as far more pessimistic at the moment. In the chart below, we show the readings of the AAII bull-bear spread paired with the same spread in the Investors Intelligence survey and the NAAIM Exposure index. Whereas the latter two surveys have basically seen readings return back to their historical averages, the AAII survey sits 1.6 standard deviations below its historical average. In other words, overall sentiment might not be as pessimistic as the AAII survey would imply.

> # Claims Spend Another Week Below 200K

> Initial jobless claims took a step higher this week rising by 7K to 198K. With last week's number also going unrevised, claims have now been below 200K for 10 of the last 11 weeks. That being said, this week's reading was the highest since the 212K print in the first week of March.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/033023-Claims-1.png))**

> Before seasonal adjustment, claims were once again higher rising by over 10K week over week to 223K. Although that is not a concerningly high reading nor is it a large jump, the increase was peculiar in that it went against expected seasonal patterns. Prior to this year, jobless claims have only risen week over week in the current week of the year 16% of the time; the most recent instance prior to 2020 (right as claims surged at the onset of the pandemic) was in 2017.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/033023-Claims-2.png))**

> Although initial jobless claims modestly deteriorated, it has not exactly been a worrying increase as claims remain at historically healthy levels. The same goes for continuing claims. This week saw continuing claims rise by a modest 4K to 1.689 million. That is only the highest level since the end of February when claims totaled over 1.7 million.

> # Short Interest Update

> Although equities broadly are starting the new week higher, the most heavily shorted stocks are trading lower today. In the chart below, we show the relative strength of an index of the 100 most heavily shorted stocks versus the Russell 3,000 since January 2021 (the peak of the meme stock mania). Overall, the past couple of years since that period have consistently seen heavily shorted names underperform as seen through the downward trending line below. Although heavily shorted names saw some outperformance in January, they are making new lows.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032723-SIPF-1a.png))**

> On Friday, the latest short interest data as of mid-March was released by FINRA. Overall, there has not been too much of a change in short interest levels with the average reading on short interest as a percentage of float of Russell 3,000 stocks rising by 5 bps since the start of the year to 5.8%.

> Prior to the changes to industry classifications that went into effect one week ago, the formerly labeled ""retailing"" industry consistently held the highest levels of short interest. Now, it is the Consumer Discretionary Distribution and Retail industry in the top spot with an average short interest level of 12.7%. That is up from 12.5% coming into the year and is multiple percentage points higher than the two next highest industries: Pharmaceuticals, Biotechnology & Life Sciences (9.36%) and Autos (9.18%). In spite of the recent bank closures, the banking industry actually has the lowest average levels of short interest. That being said, the latest data as of March 15th would have only accounted for a few days following the collapse of SVB. As such, the next release scheduled for April 12th with end-of-month data will provide a better read on the recent banking trouble's impact on short interest levels.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032723-Industy.png))**

> In the table below, we show the individual Russell 3,000 stocks with the highest levels of short interest as of the March 15th data. The sole two stocks with more than half of shares sold short are both Health Care names: Design Therapeutics (DSGN) and Allogene Therapeutics (ALLO). Both have seen short interest levels rise mid-single digits year to date. Other notables with high levels of short interest include some names that were briefly in vogue in recent years like Carvana (CVNA) and Beyond Meat (BYND). While short interest levels remain elevated, those are also two of the stocks listed below that have seen the largest declines in short interest this year which is likely due to solid appreciation in their stock prices. Only Marathon Digital (MARA) has seen a larger drop with its short interest level falling 11.4 percentage points since the end of last year after the stock more than doubled year to date. We would also note another crypto-related name, MicroStrategy (MSTR), is on the list and has been the second-best performer of the Russell 3,000 stocks with the highest short interest.

> # Commercial Bank Deposits Down a Record 3.33% YoY

> The Federal Reserve's FRED data on commercial bank deposits was just updated through the week of 3/15. From the prior week, deposits fell roughly $100 billion, or about 0.56% from $17.6 trillion down to $17.5 trillion. A week-over-week decline of 0.56% is nothing out of the norm, although it was the biggest decline in percentage terms since last April when deposits fell 0.6% during the week of 4/20.

> What is out of the norm is the drop we've seen in bank deposits over the last year. Prior to 2023, the largest year-over-year decline we'd ever seen in bank deposits was a 1.58% drop back in September 1994. That record drop was broken earlier this year when we got a reading of -1.61% during the week of 2/1. Since 2/1, the year-over-year decline has only gotten worse. As of the most recent week (3/15), the year-over-year decline stands at -3.33%.

> Below is a chart showing the year-over-year change in commercial bank deposits using data from FRED. What stands out the most is not just that we're now at record YoY lows, but that it's coming after what had been record YoY increases in deposits. Remember, after COVID hit, the government deposited cash into the bank accounts of Americans multiple times.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/deposits-yoy.png))**

> Below is a look at the absolute level of commercial bank deposits over the years going back to 1974 when FRED's data begins. During the COVID recession from March through May 2020, bank deposits increased roughly $2 trillion. As you can see in the chart, we've never seen a spike anywhere near as large over such a short period of time. Notably, though, deposits kept on running higher for the next two years, rising another $2.8 trillion by the time they peaked at $18.16 trillion in mid-April 2022. That peak came a month after the Fed's first rate hike of the current tightening cycle, and since then we've seen deposits fall about $650 billion from their highs. Given how elevated deposits remain above pre-COVID levels, there's no reason to think they won't fall further unless banks really step up the interest they're paying on deposits given a Fed Funds rate of 5%.

> # Pending Home Sales Better But Still Weak

> As we noted on Twitter earlier, Pending Home Sales for the month of February came in better than expected, rising by 0.8% compared to forecasts for a 3.0% decline. Wednesday's report also marked the first string of back to back to back positive and better-than-expected readings since the second half of 2020. While the increases are welcomed, we would note that on a y/y basis, Pending Home Sales remain depressed. Relative to a year ago, February Pending Home sales declined 21.1% which is actually an improvement from late last year when they were down over 30% for three straight months.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032923-Pending-YY.png))**

> A 20%+ y/y decline in Pending Home Sales is not unprecedented, but it isn't common either. Prior to the current period, the only other times they were down over 20% were in the early months of COVID and in a handful of other months during and immediately after the financial crisis. What has been unprecedented about the current period is the fact that Pending Home Sales has been down 20%+ for nine straight months! Going back to 2002, there was never another period where Pending Home Sales were down 20%+ or more for even three months let alone nine!

3268,"Unveiling the Powerhouse: How Nickel Will Take Electric Vehicles to the Next Level The global shift toward electric vehicles (EVs) is reshaping the automotive industry, and at the crux of it, lithium-ion batteries have become the MVP. These batteries represent a significant advancement in technology. Their composition, made up of lithium, graphite, nickel, manganese and cobalt, has been fortified to power electric vehicles at an unparalleled rate, but among these critical components, there is one that stands out for its indispensable role. Nickel.  

Nickel enhances everything from a battery’s energy density and performance while also addressing cost considerations. It is also a fundamental component of the cathodes found in lithium-ion batteries. Cathodes form the core structure alongside other materials like lithium, cobalt, and manganese. Different formulations, such as nickel-cobalt-manganese (NCM) and nickel-cobalt-aluminum (NCA), utilize varying proportions of nickel, each offering distinct advantages. 

The energy density of a battery is a crucial factor in determining the driving range of EVs. Nickel, with its ability to contribute to higher energy density, also allows for greater energy storage capacity and charge/discharge rates. This means longer driving ranges on a single charge are possible with lithium-ion batteries. Its inclusion in the cathodes ensures a more responsive driving experience and extends the lifespan of the battery, which ultimately contributes both to the sustainability and wider adoption of EVs. 

Nickel is also used to address concerns associated with the use of cobalt, another critical component in battery cathodes. Cobalt is known for its high cost and ethical sourcing issues. By incorporating nickel and minimizing cobalt content, manufacturers can reduce costs and implement more sustainable battery production practices. 

It’s clear that nickel offers insurmountable benefit, however the US currently holds a limited domestic supply of it. To continue steady production of EV batteries, the country needs a larger volume of supply to ensure its metal needs are met for the energy transition. Projections indicate that the U.S. will require [23 times more nickel, cobalt, and lithium by 2035.](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/miners-face-considerable-challenges-meeting-demand-us-climate-law-study-2023-08-15/#:~:text=By%202035%2C%20demand%20for%20lithium,in%20EVs%20and%20other%20electronics.)  

Alaska holds extensive and untapped reservoirs of substantial nickel reserves, and fortunately, playing a pivotal role in the domestic nickel mining endeavor within Alaska, in particular, is Alaska Energy Metals Corporation (TSX-V: AEMC) (OTCQB: AKEMF) through its Nikolai nickel Project. 

Robust historical drilling data strongly suggests that there is existence of a significant nickel deposit, along with other precious metals at Nikolai. The company is focused on sulphide nickel and battery metals, and the project holds the promise of supplying a substantial nickel deposit, potentially in the multi-billion-pound range. More information about $AEMC can be found [here](https://alaskaenergymetals.com/).

3707,"$ICU - SeaStar Medical Issued U.S. Patent with Broad Claims Covering Use of the Selective Cytopheretic Device for Multiple Clinical Indications DENVER, Jan. 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SeaStar Medical Holding Corporation (Nasdaq: ICU), a medical device company developing proprietary solutions to reduce the consequences of hyperinflammation on vital organs, announces the issuance of U.S. Patent No. 11,866,730 with broad claims directed to methods of using the Selective Cytopheretic Device (SCD) to treat subjects with inflammatory conditions and to process activated leukocytes and platelets. The SCD is a first-in-class, cell-directed extracorporeal therapy that selectively targets highly active inflammatory cells to quell the inflammatory response.

“This patent significantly fortifies our intellectual property portfolio and is highly supportive of our strategy to validate our technology’s application across multiple high-value clinical indications in which hyperinflammation plays a role,” said Eric Schlorff, CEO of SeaStar Medical. “Regardless of its source, uncontrolled hyperinflammation can lead to vital organ damage and even death. Our SCD therapy works to selectively target the most highly activated cells responsible for inflammation to bring activated cells into a reparative state. This can stop the potential damage of over-activated cells and potentially reverse the damage they cause.”

This newly issued patent covers methods for using SCD cartridges to treat inflammatory conditions by extracorporeally sequestering activated leukocytes and/or platelets and inhibiting or deactivating their inflammatory action, as well as methods for processing activated leukocytes and/or platelets. Treating inflammatory conditions requires controlling the number of leukocytes and/or platelets without removing too many cells, which can harm the healing process. The patent’s claimed methods require the SCD cartridge to have specific ratios of surface area for sequestering activated leukocytes and/or platelets to SCD inner volume.

Unlike pathogen removal and other blood-purification tools, the SCD selectively targets the most highly activated proinflammatory neutrophils and monocytes. The Company has observed that these most highly activated immune cells are turned off in a low calcium environment. The SCD therapy mimics nature by creating a unique micro-environment, attracting these highly activated effector cells and neutralizing them in such an environment. These cells are then returned to the body through the blood, signaling the body to focus on repair.

8599,"Pre-FOMC Day… 1-30-24 SPY/ ES Futures, QQQ/ NQ Futures, 10YR Yield, and DXY/ US Dollar Daily Market Analysis (Earnings Review)   

Today was the first time in weeks that we have seen the bears have any sort of strength (at least on NQ). For the most part today ES/Spy just sat and chopped in a very tight range… up and until power hour ES had only moved a total of 16.5 points and SPY has only moved a total of $1.37. This makes for easily one of the smallest overall ranges that ES/Spy have moved inside intraday in a very long time. I think the only time it had a smaller range was when the markets had half days.

Fun chart above shows that there has been 10 other times (this being the 11th) where SPX has had 12 green weeks out of 13 in a row. The max total drawdown the 3 months after that was 2.36%. On average 3 months after a move like this markets were 3.84% higher.

We have some heavy hitting data the next three days with some very important pre-market data tomorrow. 

**FOMC**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y0aijledgnfc1.png?width=447&format=png&auto=webp&s=9febb2a41c4a31b8eae83270670f8193f0d285fd

Of the last 9 FOMCs we have opened green 5 out of 9 times with an average move up of 0.16% overnight. We have also closed green 5 out of 9 times with an average close of 0.73%+.  However I don’t know the last time we have had three major earnings and data the night into FOMC. 

This FOMC is an interesting one in my opinion and here is why. I honestly do not think this FOMC matters in the grand scheme of things. Why? Its simple… markets 100% expect a continuation in pause of rates at this meeting. There is nothing to really surprise markets here with rates. We also do not get DOT Plot (arguably the most important thing that comes from FOMC) until March. Meaning while JPOW can say whatever he wants about the rate cuts and forward guidance until the markets see a change in the dot plot (at march meeting) it really doesn’t matter. We did have a spike in CPI last meeting, which I do expect JPOW to emphasize is concerning for them. However, it really does not matter because we get two more readings of CPI before the March meeting. 

Almost every event for the last 4 months markets have said “this is the event that finally sends us down.” Yet the market has just continued to rally every single time and chooses to not care about pretty much anything. I still find it completely unwise to bet against the bulls in the grand scheme of things. 

This feels a lot like I believe it was October 2023 where we had a similar move in CPI, FOMC and Earnings all around the same week to two week time frame. “IT set up the perfect bearish scenario” yet the markets chose to completely ignore it all and rally. I do think the same setup presents here… however I would wait for it to actually turn bearish before I short this market. 

If the markets are bloody (think -1% at least) at close tomorrow there is a sizeable chance we see downside continuation. However, until we realistically get a move like that and more importantly as stated before close under the daily 20ema I think markets will continue to ignore all data and continue to pump to the upside. 

As a friendly warning for anyone that has not traded FOMC Day… 2pm will be a big move… it will be violent. Tread lightly… 230pm is historically when we see the reversal… 

**SPY DAILY** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/izvlfsxdgnfc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffbf1040b15091e4476c113272909d35c9e30df3

We continue to see daily extreme bull momentum on SPY and we continue to push to hold supports. There is an incredibly impressive red rising wedge formed here now too.

Bears have an opportunity to drop us to 487.36 support tomorrow (< 1% drop). That should be their ultimate target with a bigger target of 485.38.

Bulls will target an almost 2% green day tomorrow to hit the big $500 that everyone has been talking about. 

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 487.98  
 Demand- 485.38 -> 487.36

ES remains in extreme daily bull momentum like SPY, however, it did not see daily buyers come in to support this upside move here. Now unlike SPY we actually are seeing a new daily supply at 4951. This is mostly due to the after hours drop related to earnings. 

Bulls will make a push for 5000 tomorrow which is about a 1% push up.

Bears will make a push for 4913 which is about a 1% drop and then 4900 which is just under 1.5% drop. 

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 4919  
 Demand- 4900 -> 4913

On QQQ unlike SPY/ ES we got a new daily supply today at 428.26. We also did not see buyers support the upside move. The QQQ daily has really built out a nice 5 day long 423.71-428.26 range. 

Tomorrow I am targeting a +/- $5 or about 1% move on QQQ to target either under $420 or over $430. 

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 411.52 -> 428.26  
 Demand- 406.1 -> 423.71

**NQ FUTURES DAILY**

QQQ and NQ continue to (Especially today) look far heavier than ES/Spy… We have a really nice 17506-177697 range built out over the last almost 6 days. We came down here after hours directly to that 17506 support area but haven’t quite closed under it. 

There is quite the impressive red rising wedge formed here too which broke after hours on the earnings announcements. 

Much like QQQ I am looking for about a 1% +/- move on NQ or about 200 points… targets are a closure under 17300 for bears or over 17700 for bulls. A bigger 300pt move takes us to 17800 or under daily 20ema support near 17200. 

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 17133 -> 17697  
 Demand- 16858 -> 17506

**US 10YR YIELD DAILY**

I expect the 10yr to have a huge amount of movement overnight and into tomorrow with earnings and everything else happening. 

The 10YR has been in an upward bull channel for the last month and a half now and as of today it officially wicked through that support. It also is back under the daily 20ema support for the first time since 1/12/24 and took out supply at 4.042% which was our target. 

Bears need to see a major bounce here on the 10yr to close back over 8/20ema resistance of 4.104%.

Bulls would like to see this downside move on the 10yr continue and will ideally target a bigger drop to the 3.906-3.948% double demand area (over the next week or so). 

US 10YR YIELD DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 4.16%  
 Demand- 3.948% -> 4.129%

DXY is dangerously close to losing the same 1.5 month long bull channel that the 10YR lost today. 

We also got a new supply at 103.451. Much like ES/ NQ we remain in a about 30 cent chop range here (at close) on DXY for the last 12 days… 

Bulls need to see a huge drop in DXY tomorrow under 103.246 but ideally under the 20ema support of 103.069.

Bears will look to bard bounce the EMA supports to close over 103.541 but ideally close over 103.8.

DXY/ US DOLLAR DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 103.541 -> 104.083  
 Demand- 102.32 -> 103.246"

Outside of IPOs and secondary offerings, any money I use to purchase equities, the company doesn’t see it. “Not investing in unethical companies” doesn’t seem to solve anything since your investment doesn’t go to the company but rather the trader you’re exchanging with.  

Why should I care if my money goes to Nestle stock when Nestle doesn’t see that money?  On the surface, ESG investing seems to solve a problem that doesn’t exist. The best I can think of is that, in general, buying and thus helping increase market capitalization values executive pay higher and higher valuations for potential future secondary offerings or acquisitions/future buyout/loan possibilities.  However, this doesn’t deter me as it doesn’t seem ESG investing meaningfully impacts this reality. I’m sure there are facets of this I’m missing, so I’m excited to hear others thoughts on this.

7705,"INTEL PUTS🔥🔥🔥🔥 The state of Israel is a close ally of the United States and has enjoyed strong bipartisan support from Congress for decades. Not having a House speaker could have some negative effects on the relationship between the two countries, such as:

•	⁠Delaying or blocking the passage of bills or resolutions that support Israel's security and interests, such as the annual military aid package, the Iron Dome defense system, or the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital¹²⁶. •	⁠Reducing the influence and leverage of the United States in the Middle East, especially in the context of the recent war between Israel and Hamas, the Iranian nuclear deal, and the Abraham Accords²⁵. •	⁠Creating uncertainty and confusion among Israel's leaders and public about the reliability and commitment of the United States as a strategic partner and friend⁴⁵.

However, not having a House speaker does not mean that the U.S.-Israel relationship is doomed or irreparable. There are still many members of Congress from both parties who support Israel and seek to maintain a strong and mutually beneficial alliance. For example, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy visited Israel in May 2023 and addressed the Knesset, expressing his solidarity and friendship with Israel⁵⁶. He also led a bipartisan delegation of lawmakers who met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other officials to discuss various issues of common concern⁵⁶.

Therefore, while not having a House speaker could pose some challenges and risks for the U.S.-Israel relationship, it does not necessarily mean that the relationship is in crisis or collapse. The two countries share many values, interests, and goals, and have a long history of cooperation and friendship. As long as there are people on both sides who are willing to work together and overcome the difficulties, the U.S.-Israel relationship can survive and thrive.

**TORONTO and HAIFA, Israel, Feb. 02, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NurExone Biologic Inc. (TSXV: NRX) (FSE: J90) (NRX.V), known as ""NurExone,"" is pleased to announce the initiation of the Orphan Drug Designation process with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for its groundbreaking ExoPTEN product, currently in development for patients with acute spinal cord injury. This strategic move follows the recent grant of Orphan Drug Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for ExoPTEN.**

**Dr. Ina Sarel, Head of CMC, Quality, and Regulation at NurExone Biologic, expressed enthusiasm about the development, stating, ""Embarking on the European Orphan Drug Designation process marks a crucial milestone in our mission to bring life-changing treatments to patients in need around the world.""**

**The recent FDA approval of Orphan Drug Designation for ExoPTEN in the United States underscores the potential of Nurexone Biologic's therapeutic approach in a field where treatment options are limited, and it is expected to yield significant market benefits for the Company. The initiation of the European Orphan Drug Designation process represents a strategic move to broaden the reach of this promising treatment globally.**

**Orphan Drug Designation is granted to therapies addressing rare diseases, providing incentives to encourage the development of treatments for conditions affecting a small number of patients.

2296,"Wealthfront Automated Investing vs VTSAX 10 year returns: 7.5% vs 11.9% What am I missing here? According to Wealthfront own website, a risk level of 9.0 had a 7.5% return over 10 years. Whereas a stock index fund like VTSAX had 11.9% returns. Why would you use Wealthfront Automated Investing (highest rated robo-advisor per Robo-report) instead of just putting all your money into something like VTSAX?"
2896,"UPDATE: The all-time-high of Bitcoin was 69k$ in 2021 — in 2024’s money that’s 75,7k$ (now accounting for inflation AND increased total supply of Bitcoin) In [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1atd61z/the_alltimehigh_of_bitcoin_was_69k_in_2021_in/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), some people (correctly) pointed out that to accurately reflect the inflation-adjusted all-time-high of Bitcoin from 2021 in today's money, I should have taken into consideration the fact that the total supply of Bitcoin also went up in this same period. I looked into it and found an even more interesting (potentially big) fact:

**Between 2017 and 2021, the total supply of Bitcoin increased** ***faster*** **than USD inflation**: 

* the total supply of Bitcoin went up by 12,8%, while 
* USD inflation went up by 10,5%. 
* This means that if we adjust for inflation AND the increased supply, the high of 20k$ in 2017 was ""worth"" 19,6k$ by 2021 (-1%). 

**Between 2021 and 2024, the total supply of Bitcoin increased** ***slower*** **than USD inflation**: 

* the total supply of Bitcoin went up by 3,8%, while 
* USD inflation went up by 13,8%. 
* This means that if we adjust for inflation AND the increased supply, the all-time-high of 69k$ in 2021 is now ""worth"" 75,7k$ (+9,7%). 

**Conclusion****: this is first cycle during which the total supply of Bitcoin has increased slower than USD inflation**, and we can reasonably expect this to be the norm from now on. 

Obviously, it's also fair to point out that there is no real rationale behind the all-time-highs of Bitcoin (so none of this really means anything), and that USD is not the only currency in which Bitcoin is being traded. This analysis is just for fun, but still interesting to think about, I think. 

\*\*\*

I hope my math is correct, the calculations are based on these figures ([sauce](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/total-bitcoins)) plus the ones from my previous post: 

* Total supply of Bitcoin on 30 December 2017:   
16,771,956
* Total supply of Bitcoin  on 31 December 2021:   
18,915,556

Revenue:

Uber reported net income of $1.4 billion, or 66 cents per share, compared with $595 million, or 29 cents per share, in the same quarter last year. Uber's net income includes a $1 billion net tail wind thanks to ""unrealized gains"" from revaluations of its equity investments, according to a release.

The company's revenue for the quarter was up 15% from the same quarter last year. Uber's gross bookings came in at $37.6 billion, up 22% year over year.


There's a lot of hate on this stock, but this honestly seems like another classic case of inverse Reddit. Another strong quarter of growth and strong momentum. I wouldn't be surprised at short term consolidation or pullback after a crazy run up but long term if Uber can execute, it will continue to generate nice profits. Dara is also running the company quite well and has consistently followed through on beat-and-raises for guidance.

# [Stock futures are little changed after Fed hikes rates, bank contagion fears return: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/03/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures were little changed Thursday, a day after the Federal Reserve hiked rates by another 25 basis points. Traders also grappled with returning contagion fears in the regional bank space.
*****
> Futures linked to the S&P 500 were flat. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 10 points, as Nasdaq-100 futures rose 0.25%.
*****
> Shares of PacWest tanked by more than 35% in premarket trading. The decline came after news that the California bank has been assessing strategic options, including a possible sale, a person familiar told CNBC. Regional bank shares sold off hard, with Western Alliance tumbling 18% and Zions Bancorporation dropping about 7%.
*****
> There likely won’t be a respite for the embattled regional banking sector until the Fed cuts interest rates, said Jeffrey Gundlach, CEO of DoubleLine. Since the closure of Silicon Valley Bank in March, First Republic has joined the ranks of failed institutions and was recently taken over by JPMorgan Chase.
*****
> “Leaving rates this high is going to continue this stress,” Gundlach said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell” Wednesday. “I believe with a very high degree of probability there’s going to be further regional bank failures.”
*****
> As the Fed pushed through its 10th rate hike in this cycle and the central bank seemed to soften its language on future increases, Chair Jerome Powell said that it may be too soon to cut.
*****
> “We on the committee have a view that inflation is going to come down not so quickly,” he said in his post-meeting press conference. “It will take some time, and in that world, if that forecast is broadly right, it would not be appropriate to cut rates and we won’t cut rates.”
*****
> Stocks closed lower Wednesday, with the Dow shedding 270 points, or 0.8%, and the S&P 500 dropping 0.7%. The Nasdaq Composite lost roughly 0.5%.
*****
> Looming ahead are key economic reports that will inform the Fed’s next steps from here. Initial jobless claims are due Thursday. Friday’s main event will be April’s payrolls report, which economists polled by Dow Jones predict will rise by 180,000.
*****
> In terms of earnings, investors will be watching Moderna, which issues results before the opening bell Thursday. Apple is slated to post earnings after the market’s close, along with Lyft, DraftKings and Coinbase.

6740,"How I saved my small account. Lessons learned. End of of 2022 I put 1000 dollars into my Webull account. Prior, I had success trading “internet monies” and was able to turn a relatively small amount into respectable money (started in 2018-present. Don’t trade “internet monies” much anymore though. Too much regulation came into the space) I finally decided I wanted to jump into stocks to try them. I was only trading spot and quickly wrecked my account. Initially I was doing fine and turned that 1k into 1130$. What made me quickly descend was a combination of things. 

1: I fell into the party life and wasn’t taking good care of myself and my mental health (which was poor to begin with) suffered which greatly impacted my trading. This seeped into my trading life and I began to trade emotionally.

2: I was mainly relying on technical analysis instead of using it in conjunction with fundamental analysis. 

3: I was trading companies I didn’t understand. 

4: I was trading companies that didn’t have real value and would be unattractive long term buys if I were to actually invest in them.

5: I strayed from my trading indicators I normally used that worked during my “internet monies” trading era, I was using way too many. There was way too much noise on the charts.

I killed my account essentially and gave up on it for a long time as I dealt with other personal problems in my life. I fell into a deep depression. Not from the account but a lot of things building up in my life. One day I received a thought that felt like it was sent to me ‘you need to revisit your account. You can’t give up so easily’. 

I began studying stocks more. I didn’t paper trade but I’m able to memorize numbers easily and would mentally take notes of what did what to each stock I was looking at and would compare the results to my thesis.
Finally I felt confident enough to start trading again. I started very small and slowly began working my way up with the size of my trades. All in all I’ve recovered my account with a 30% total profit over a series of 80 trades I’ve taken in the past 3 months. 

Things that helped me

1: The more I focused on market structure instead of using indicators the better my trading became

2:I only traded companies that I would be comfortable investing in

3: I look for good companies that are getting attacked in the media. I wait for them to go on discount and use my indicators to be able to see when a recovery is starting to form and sellers become exhausted. 

4: I stopped smoking or drinking. 

5: I stopped trading after hours.

6: I leave runners once I’m in profit on the majority of my position. 

7: I don’t short (for the most part, I recently shorted BITO when the etfs got approved. I already closed those for a profit since I think that certain “internet money” will retest it’s recent highs before a massive correction into the 20/25k range). I’d rather make my money going long and then rotate into another beaten down stock. 

8: I stick to my set of rules

9: I reflect on every trade-what emotions was I dealing with? What reasons did I enter the trade? What we’re some unnecessary risks I took that can be avoided in the next trade? How could I have exited the trade better?

10: I learned how to use options 

11: I stopped “marrying “ stocks in my head. By this I mean I stopped becoming emotionally attached for companies. I became purely methodical in my trades.






If you’re wondering what indicators I use it’s 
2 different EMAs (different lengths depending on the chart) and Keltner channels. I like them better than bollinger bands.
I have one more script I use but It’s for personal use only (sorry). If I gave it away it would be worthless. Not for sale.

My ending advice is to focus on market structure and volume. You can come back from massive failures. One step at a time. Keep learning and don’t trade more than a few percentages of your portfolio at a time.
The only book I recommend is “A complete guide to volume price analysis “ by Anna Coulling. It’s not the newest book but it’s information is great. Got it for a couple bucks on kindle. I will update as my trading journey continues further along. I genuinely thought I would never see my account return to these levels but these last few months have been a great learning period. Peace out ✌️"

6445,"These are the stocks on my watchlist (2/14) &#x200B;

No positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers)

To clarify since I've been asked: I usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel: they're just my perspective of where a stock could potentially go. Percentages signify what the stock is trading at when I write up the report and are NOT predictions of stock price EOD. Some of the stocks I post are <$500M market cap and are NOT good long-term investments, but are good candidates to day trade.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

6378,"[OC] The case for Peloton (PTON) 3 points to consider: &#x200B;

There is no doubt that Peloton stock has had a roller coaster ride since 2020.

When Peloton IPO'd in 2019, it was priced around $25-$30 a share.  When COVID hit in 2020 (and the lockdowns began), Peloton was positioned perfectly to capitalize on the millions of customers who could longer go and workout at gyms or even their workplaces. This drove Peloton's sales and subscriber growth exponentially and is what helped it's stock skyrocket going from $25 to $151 (+600% gain) by December 1, 2020. Peloton was the darling of Wallstreet. Then, the lockdowns lifted, and with it, Peloton saw its vast army of customers begin to return to their normal lives, and gyms. The growth estimates were proven to be wildly optimistic, and Peloton itself failed to scale/manage it's growth properly resulting in its stock to fall almost over 95% in the last few years resulting in today's share price of $4.33.

This huge fall in price in such a short time, is something that can easily skew investors opinion of the stock especially if that investor bought in to Peloton when it was at its high of $150- there were many people who fell victim to the  ""sunk cost fallacy"" trap. Which states: ""It is irrational to use irrecoverable costs to justify a present decision. If we acted rationally, only future costs and benefits would be taken into account.""  In other words, investors holding PTON while it fell and fell. The ""sunk cost fallacy"" way of thinking can make it extremely difficult to be objective on any investment.  Or, put another way, Peloton's meteoric rise and fall could be seen as a Value trap.

**Points to consider:**

It is unrealistic to think Peloton can return to its pandemic era stock valuation of $151 in the near term, however It is also equally unrealistic to treat Peloton as if its business (not just the stock) has lost 95% of its value in the last few years. All of the below points have caveats, I understand the risks Peloton still has to manage to truly be considered as ""turning the corner"", however, I believe that Peloton is oversold with much of the well documented bad news already priced in. So below are some positive  things I found in my DD about Peloton.

1. **Peloton Price advantage**:  I own a Peloton tread, and what I found surprising was Pelotons price point to buy a Peloton treadmill was **$3,000**. (I remembered peloton in 2019 being in the news for being the ""treadmill for the rich"" as it cost close to $20,000).  I first noticed this price difference when purchasing treadmills for a new gym a couple months ago. For comparison, a Precore TRM 835 Treadmill costs $10,795.00 (the TRM 835 has none of the user experience/interface/connectivity that peloton has). In addition, Peloton's monthly membership, priced currently at $12.99 a month which is cheaper than a gym membership. Its subscription services is robust and is always adding new features.  It gives you access to Peloton's vast library of top of the line instructor classes and so much other content  (i.e.I found the new ""video game"" feature on the treadmill i found to be engaging and fun).
2. **Peloton is an industry disruptor.** It has taken a bland, and relatively unchanged market of at home fitness equipment to a whole different level. Peloton's brand power, and unique positioning as the ""household"" name for at home fitness should not be underestimated. Where they differ from other fitness equipment makers is in their user experience and the quality of their machines with large Tesla like touchscreens, their community of trainers/users, and their ability to constantly upgrade the tread software over the cloud. Being a disruptor in any industry justifies a higher p/e (or in Pelaton's case) patience for the company to become profitable, Peloton is
3. **""Great product not a great stock""** \- analyst on CNBC.  I think this is a common belief among wallstreet. , I see this sentiment as illogical and indicative of a buying opportunity. The idea that a stock is somehow ""separate"" from the product its company produces is exactly where the opportunity is to invest resides. What the analyst was possibly alluding to was looking at Peloton quantitatively (by its numbers, growth estimates, revenues etc...) peloton may not look like a great stock- But looking at it qualitatively, Peloton looks ""great""., I see this sentiment as a possible opportunity, Bad products lead to bad stocks. Conversely,  good products (generally speaking) lead to good stocks. A good product/business will eventually be reflected in the stock if the company can keep producing this product, and if significant ""moats"" exist to protect its market share. Currently, I do not know of any other at-home fitness company can be compared apples to apples to Peloton. Peloton has a huge head start and significant 'moat' around its business.

I would love to hear anyone else's opinions on Peloton being undervalued/overvalued.

Thanks!"
830,"5 days to earnings report for NVDA … and today This is my take .

RSI (Relative Strength Index):

The RSI is at approximately 73.03, which suggests that the stock is nearing overbought territory. This could indicate that there may be a potential pullback as traders might start taking profits, expecting the price to drop after an extended upward move.


MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):

The MACD line is above the signal line and both are above zero, indicating that there is still bullish momentum. However, the histogram is showing shorter bars compared to previous ones, suggesting a possible slowdown in momentum.


Volume:

The volume does not show any extraordinary spikes, which suggests there is no significant buying or selling pressure that would indicate a change in the current trend.


Stochastic Momentum Index (SMI):

The SMI is in the upper half of the range, indicating some bullish momentum. However, it is not in the extreme, which could suggest that there is still room for the upward trend to continue, albeit with caution as it approaches potential overbought levels.


Ichimoku Cloud:

The price is above the Ichimoku Cloud, which is traditionally considered a bullish signal. This indicates that the stock is in a favorable uptrend.


Bollinger Bands:

The price is hovering around the upper Bollinger Band but not breaking through it, suggesting that the stock is experiencing upward momentum. However, traders often watch for price interactions with the bands; if the price consistently touches or crosses the upper band, it may indicate an overbought condition.


Pivot Points:

The price is above the central pivot point, which can be interpreted as a bullish indicator for the trading session. If the price maintains above this level, it could suggest further bullish sentiment.


Interpretation: Given the RSI is nearing overbought levels, traders might excersice caution for potential pullback or consolidation BUT The bullish trend indicated by the MACD and the price position over the Ichimoku clouds and central pivot may still attract for today traders"
9208,Multiple XRP Capitulation Posts popping up... bullish sign? So I was being sent several XRP capitulation threads in my feed from over on the NPC hive mind r/CryptoCurrency today. Of course the low IQ XRP hating bots are suddenly back spamming the threads with the same old long debunked FUD again. I don't know about all of you but this has me feeling some bullish tingles.

In short many customers are raging at the 5$ bill credit offering that will be issued within 2 bill cycles. It seems insignificant considering the inconvenience and disruption the outage may have caused for people. They will surely recoup their 5$ credit with fees and other charges within those 2 bill periods. Whole deal seems very shady.

7068,"Understanding options I’m new to options trading and I’m trying to fully grasp the risk involved with it. When you buy let’s say contracts for calls on any stock you end up paying 100 * the contract price * the number of contracts you purchase. As the time decays the contracts gradually lose value, it’s a essentially a race against the expiration date and the strike price. What I don’t understand is why options are seen as so risky? It’s not like margin trading where you can over leverage yourself and end up in debt. Worse case your contacts expire before you sell them and you lose the premium you paid(at least per my understanding). Currently with my exchange (TD Ameritrade) there are three levels of option trading that can be given to traders. You need to apply to be able to “level up” or even gain access to the “first level”. To me it feels like an excessive child proofing lock and I’m trying figure out if it actually is, or if it’s not and I’m just missing something."

8663,"Top Two Bull Flags to Watch Through the End of the Month Hope everyone has been having a good week so far! Right now I am looking at two small caps $AKEMF and $LPTV. Specifically two breakouts from bull flags. One has already broken out and the other is soon to. Let's take a closer look.  
First up we have $AKEMF that just broke out of its bull flag. It is pulling back and testing the bull flag which is very typical. I will definitely be watching the bounce here. However, I must admit that I am a little concerned with the volume. I wish it was a little bit higher, but It looks like the uptrend will continue.

Next up we have LPTV. This chart has not broken out just yet. From my brief knowledge of this company, I believe there was news that has brought bullish momentum to this stock. Definitely keep an eye on this stock, it is a textbook bull flag.

# [Stock futures are flat, weighed down by fears the Fed will keep raising rates aggressively](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/06/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures fell Wednesday as investors worry that the Federal Reserve will hand out another large rate hike in September in a bid to tame high inflation.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 86 points, giving up earlier gains. S&P 500 futures also retreated, edging lower by 0.30%, and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.27%. If the slide continues into the trading day, it could be the eighth negative session in a row for the Nasdaq Composite.
*****
> Stock futures dipped into negative territory after a Wall Street Journal article suggested that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s commitment to reduce inflation could mean that the central bank hikes rates by 0.75 percentage point in September, which would be the third consecutive increase of that size. Markets have been hoping that the Fed would start to hand out smaller increases starting in September, but are now pricing in an 86% chance of a 0.75 percentage point hike.
*****
> Stocks added to their three-week slide Tuesday. The Dow fell about 173 points, or 0.5%, and the S&P 500 slid 0.4%. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.7% to notch its first seven-day losing streak since 2016.
*****
> The moves came amid a surge in bond yields that saw the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield jump to its highest level since June. The rate on the 30-year Treasury closed at its highest level since 2014. Bond yields move inversely to prices. Rates dipped slightly Wednesday, with the 10-year trading at 3.321%. The 2-year and 30-year yields traded at 3.47% and 3.472%, respectively.
*****
> Investors are split on how to approach the market entering the first post-Labor Day week in September, a notoriously cruel month for stocks. All eyes are on the 3,900 level on the S&P 500. Some see the index falling to even lower lows, while others are optimistic about a year-end rally.
*****
> “With equities back to June lows and the rates path reset higher, more inflation easing along with decisive EU government intervention to tackle the energy crisis could prompt another bear squeeze,” Emmanuel Cau of Barclays wrote in a Wednesday note. “Big picture, we think stocks remain in a tough spot given a poor growth-policy trade-off.”
*****
> On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will give its summary on current economic conditions, also known as the Beige Book. Elsewhere, Fed presidents Loretta Mester of Cleveland and Tom Barkin of Richmond, as well as Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard are scheduled to speak at various events.

# [Stock futures rise as Wall Street awaits key inflation report](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/12/stock-futures-are-higher-as-wall-street-awaits-key-inflation-report-.html)

*****
> Stock futures were higher Tuesday as investors waited for an important inflation data point ahead of the Federal Reserve’s September meeting.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were up 207 points, or 0.6%. S&P 500 futures were up 0.7%, and Nasdaq 100 futures gained 0.7%.
*****
> At 8:30 a.m. ET, all eyes will be on the August consumer price index report, which is expected to show a 0.1% decrease in headline inflation on a monthly basis, according to estimates from Dow Jones. On a year-over-year basis, the index is expected to show an 8% increase — down slightly from the previous month.
*****
> The report is one of the last the Fed will see ahead of their Sept. 20-21 meeting, where they’re expected to deliver their third consecutive 0.75 percentage point interest rate hike to tamp down inflation.
*****
> “The durability of the rally will likely be determined by Tuesday’s CPI report this week and the tone of the FOMC meeting next week,” said Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide.
*****
> U.S. stocks rose Monday, continuing a relief rally that began last week when all three major averages snapped three-week slumps. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained nearly 230 points, or 0.7%. The S&P 500 rose close to 1.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite added about 1.3%.
*****
> Investors’ confidence has been bolstered by the belief that inflation has already peaked. A weaker dollar and military success in Ukraine also supported stocks.

8763,"The $X Project migrates into a new CA with 8,775 holders! How far do you think it'll go? Imagine another round of a strong utility project re-launching in the next few days, first launch made it to 44M Mcap as a ATH back in Aug 2023. Where do you think the same project relaunch with 8,775+ strong community could go???

Ok, So a while back I posted about the X-Project, here I am posting about them again! Why? I am going to briefly state the reasons below:

\- 8,775 holders (X Community) have joined the project since Aug 2023, shilling, raiding social media, educating new joiners, and much more!

\- The dev & team have so far managed to create not only a great project, but great utilities too!

\> xAi: Telegram AI bot that basically answers everything! Chat GPT like but in X project telegram group!

\> X-Shot: The sniper bot that has been working faster than the likes of Maestro bot, it can be used to trade on **Eth**, **Arb**, and **Bnb** chains, and the **GOOD THING ABOUT IT** is that in the next few days they're adding more chains to it, **Sol** and more!

\> X-Caller: The caller bot that made an overall win rate of 73% in 2023! I've personally witnessed thousands of Xs made for the investors aping in its calls! The biggest was a 1105x !!!! Unbelieve, right?

\> TravelCare integration: You can basically book flights, hotels, and more using your X tokens!

Ok and they're currently sitting at 2M Mcap from the ATH of 44M mcap! Then what happens? Do they stop? **NO!!!!**

They have developed a DApp, created a better contract, so the entirety of the 8775 could migrate their tokens into the new contract safely! They're going to have a better launch backed by the best influencers and callers, best marketing team from $PEPE, and more! They're basically getting a new skin! The first launch went all the way to 44M, so if the relaunch starts at 2M Mcap, how far do you think they can get to? I'd say with everything that is going on with the market, I am looking at 60M+ mcap!

You know what's the best thing about this? It is launching in Jan 2024!!!

Including their links for your convenience, guys! Enjoy!

# **Stocks close higher Friday, Nasdaq notches third straight week of wins - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/19/stock-futures-tick-up-after-dow-goes-negative-for-the-year.html)**
*****
> Stocks rallied on Friday to finish the week strong after briefly losing the momentum of the January rally.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 330.93 points, or 1%, to close at 33,375.49, while the S&P 500 advanced 1.89% to 3,972.61. Both indexes snapped a three-day losing streak. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite rose 2.66%, with help from Netflix and Alphabet, to end the day at 11,140.43.
*****
> The Nasdaq was also the outperformer for the week, posting a 0.55% gain and its third positive week in a row. The Dow finished the week lower by 2.70%, and the S&P posted a 0.66% loss, both breaking two-week win streaks.
*****
> All of the major averages are still in positive territory for the year.
*****
> “We’re having a more emotional reaction that expected,” said Jeff Kilburg, founder and CEO of KKM Financial. “A lot of people got so pessimistic and we saw parabolic moves to kick off the year. Now, as expected, the markets aren’t going in a straight line.”
*****
> “We are finding a way to continue to move and have higher lows,” he added. “The higher lows put a little bit of confidence in the bulls. However, the technicals are still favoring the bears and selling rallies.”
*****
> Investors continued to monitor earnings reports and mega cap tech shares led the market higher. Netflix gained about 8.5% after posting more subscribers than expected even though its quarterly earnings missed analysts’ estimates. Alphabet rose more than 5% after the company announced it will lay off 12,000 employees.
*****
> “You’re seeing more weight go into some of the beat-up technology and because people are becoming a little bit more thoughtful of opportunity in the absolute tech wreck we saw in 2022,” Kilburg said.

> # Staying Classy: Market Breadth, Buying Thrusts, and Brian Fantana

> “They’ve done studies, you know. 60% of the time, it works every time.” -Brian Fantana (a.k.a. Paul Rudd) in Anchor Man

> The big rally to start in 2023 is a welcome change from what we saw last year, but the extreme nature of the rally could be a significant clue that higher prices could be in the cards.

> Walter Deemer (retired institutional market analyst) noted a “Breakaway Momentum” (BAM) thrust took place last week. This rare event happens after the total 10-day NYSE advancers to decliners is higher than 1.97. In other words, very strong market breadth over ten days. A day or two of strong breadth is normal, but to see it persist for ten days is a clue that something is happening, and we should pay close attention. Market breadth is simply how many stocks are going up versus down, suggesting a good deal of buying is happening underneath the surface.

> According to Walter, there have been 24 of these events since 1949, and the S&P 500 was up a year later 23 times and up 20.7% on average. The only time it didn’t work was a year after a signal in January 1987.

> With help from our friends at Ned Davis Research, I looked at the data and took things further. The recent total 10-day NYSE advance to decline came in at 2.16, so I looked at all the times it was above 2.10 versus the 1.97 that Walter used. In other words, even stronger breadth.

> Doing this showed 14 previous instances (the one last week was number 15). Once again, the future returns appear solid, higher a year later 13 times but up six months later every single time. I’ll say that again, six months later, stocks have never been lower after this signal and were historically up nearly 16%. That would be a first-half rally that virtually no one is expecting.

> Here’s a breakdown of all the previous buying thrusts, again only the year after the January 1987 signal was in the red. Up more than 20% on average, a higher 94.9% of the time a year later, is something the bulls shouldn’t ignore here.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/blog-278-800x624.png))**

> This is just one bullet point, and as the great field reporter Brian Fantana told us, studies with high success percentages might sound good in theory, but they don’t always work out.

> The good news is that we’ve seen many other examples lately that suggest a change in trend has occurred, and the potential for higher prices could be coming. As I noted in “What Happens When Everyone Agrees That Stocks Will Fall?,” most investors expect a rough first half of 2023 and better second half. This is another clue that the masses could be wrong (just as they’ve been throughout history), and a surprise early 2023 rally could be firmly in the cards.

> # Bulls and Bears Almost Evenly Split

> As we noted in last night's Closer, the S&P 500 has seen a bit of technical damage done in the past few sessions. In spite of the turn lower, sentiment readings have improved. For the AAII sentiment survey, bullish sentiment has risen up to 31%. That 7 percentage point jump makes for the largest week-over-week increase and the highest reading since the week of November 17th.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/011923-Sent-1.png))**

> Bearish sentiment plummeted to 33.1% of respondents which is down sharply from just a month ago when more than half of those responding reported as pessimists. The four straight weeks of declines is now the longest such streak since August leaving bearish sentiment only 0.2 percentage points above the second half of 2022's low reached in the first week of November.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/011923-Sent-2.png))**

> As a result of the big moves, the bull-bear spread has narrowed all the way to -2.1. As we have frequently noted over the past few months, we are currently on a record streak of 42 weeks in a row with a negative bull-bear spread. This week's reading is now the narrowest reading in the spread during that streak.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/011923-Sent-3.png))**

> Taking into account other sentiment surveys, this week's readings also showed a healthy improvement in sentiment, putting a record streak on the ropes. Below, we show our sentiment composite combining the AAII bull-bear spread with that same spread from the Investors Intelligence survey as well as the NAAIM Exposure index. At the moment, sentiment is only slightly more bearish than the historical norm with the composite at -0.14. While that does extend the streak of negative readings to 54 weeks in a row (tying an identically long streak that ended in June 2009), it is one of the least pessimistic readings of the current streak. In other words, across surveys sentiment may not have turned bullish, but it appears to be much less bearish than at other points in the past year.

> # Claims Peak Early

> Jobless claims were anticipated to reverse much of last week's improvement as forecasts were calling for initial claims to rise from 205K to 214K. Instead, there was a sub-200K print as claims fell to the lowest level since the end of September.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/011923-Claims-1.png))**

> Before seasonal adjustments, claims fell to 285.58K from a seasonal peak of 339.16K last week. As shown below, a decline in the second week of the year is not unheard of but is not exactly the norm either. In most years, the second week of the year has marked the annual high for claims as the week has historically seen a week-over-week increase in claims 85% of the time. 2017 and 2018 are the two other most recent examples of claims peaking in the first rather than the second week of the year.

> All that is to say, the week-over-week drop in the seasonally adjusted number per today's print is perhaps a bit overstated. The end and start of the year tend to be volatile for seasonality thus the weeks ahead will help to provide a clearer picture of where claims really stand.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/011923-Claims-2.png))**

> Turning over to continuing claims, the first week of the year saw claims rise by 17K up to 1.647 million. That is still below higher levels observed throughout late November and December as the deterioration in claims over the past month has subsided.

> # After Bear Market January Indicator Trifecta Amazing

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/0b59794a432f735b25f144a754e2bfc7/be71515d02997b90-c6/s500x750/59988e6711df3855b32fc080b2da84f0261ac840.jpg))**

> When there has been a bear market in the prior year and our January Indicator Trifecta is 3-for-3 positive it’s super bullish for the year. January is off to a great start with the Trifecta 2-for-2 so far with our Santa Claus Rally (2023 STA, page 118) and the First 5 Days (2023 STA, page 16) logging S&P 500 gains. Keep your eye on our January Barometer (2023 STA, page 18)!

> Using the Ned Davis Research bull and bear market definitions there were thirteen years since 1949 with bear market bottoms preceding a positive January Indicator Trifecta. The full year has never been down with double-digit gains every year, up 22.1% on average. The next 11 months have also never been down, up 16.8% on average.

> The December Low Indicator (2023 STA, page 36) should also be watched with the line in the sand at the Dow’s December Closing Low of 32757.54 on 12/19/2022.

> We invented our January Indicator Trifecta in 2013 by combining our Santa Claus Rally and January Barometer, both invented by our late-founder Yale Hirsch in 1972 published in the 1973 Almanac, with the age-old First Five Days Early Warning System.

> The market is on the cusp of confirming the bull market we believe we are in and our bullish 2023 annual forecast we made on December 22. S&P 500 is flirting with clearing the downtrend line and the 200-day moving average. Next important levels are the December and August highs around 4100 and 4300.

> # Is the Surge in Purchases and Refis Believable?

> Early this morning, the weekly release of mortgage purchases and refinance applications from the Mortgage Bankers Association posted outright impressive week-over-week increases for both metrics. Beginning with a look at purchases, the reading surged almost 25% week over week for the highest reading in the index since 9/23. Even though that was a massive move higher, the purchases index remains at the low end of the past several year's range and would be only slightly better than those readings observed in the spring of 2020.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/011823-MBA-1.png))**

> Refinance applications have been at some of the lowest levels in more than 20 years, and that continues to be the case even after rising well over 30% versus last week. Similar to purchases, that massive increase only brings refis back up to levels last seen in September.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/011823-MBA-2.png))**

> While a portion of those large improvements could potentially be the result of mortgage rates dropping to some of the lowest levels in the past few months, seasonality appears to be another and more plausible factor. Likely as a result of backlogs built up during the holidays, the second week of the year has plenty of precedent for outlier-like jumps in applications. As shown below, multiple times since the early 1990s the second week of the year has seen mortgage and refinance applications rise by at least 20% and 30% week over week, respectively. In other words, even if the surge in mortgage applications is eye-catching, we would caution against jumping to the conclusion that these increases are material without further follow-through in the weeks to come.

4268,"Best way to sell BTC P2P with cash? My friend wanted to buy some of my BTC with cash. But all the years i've been using i have always found it to be a rather slow process. 

Is there a simple private app/wallet/website that makes the process a bit more transparent and possibly allows both to see immediately if the transaction is going through?"
2452,"All Public Pensions Funds Are Around 25 Percent Of Their Proclaimed Net Assets - Especially Calpers When are the members of public pension ever going to figure out that  
the numbers that they get are not accurate.   
if amazon stock trades at 100x earnings. Obviously this equity, which is representative of the entire stock market for its absurd valuation so far beyond its actual earning capability is a mockery of the intention of equity markets.   
on the balance sheet of the pension fund it has a ""paper gain""  
meaning the stock trades at 100x earnings so on paper the equity trades at 200 per share but in reality, it is really worth 25 x earnings due to its 15 percent growth rate, and not the highest quality management.   
that means that if interest rates were ever competitive than the price of the stock would effectively be cut by 75 percent, meaning the balance sheet of CALPERS, the California teachers pension fund would be in tatters. The reason is that these companies do not have earnings that substantiate their market caps.  
NONE of them do.  
For whatever reason the fiduciaries of Calpers have not told their membership that in order for their pension to be good, they need to have investments.   
To have investments, you need to be allowed to make investments.   
you cannot make investments without FREE FLOATING DEBT  
Meaning, you need a free market with debt. Or else, then the stock market gets so much capital that it becomes uninvestable, which is exactly what happened.  
Yet, the calpers financial management, act like its 2003, when there was a free market in debt.  
This is like reminiscent of bernie madoff style scam.   
The reason is the debt markets were socialized.   
You cannot have investments without price discovery  
Hilarious enough, the people who complain about ""wealth inequality"" have   
literally without exaggeration, made it impossible to get earnings from bank deposits and the stock market because THEY and also the republicans did not protest strongly, for a SUSPENSION of FREE FLOATING INTEREST RATES.  
LITERALLY INTEREST RATE PRICE CONTROLS.  
So,thereby making money worthless for investment.  
Anyone who buys an equity today like amazon will VIRTUALLY NEVER get a return from the stock in their LIFETIME.  
WHY haven't pension fund managers who get paid millions of dollars a year tell their membership that their pensions are threatened and COMPLETELY unsustainable without having free floating interest rates?  
This is criminal level negligence. They continue drawing their checks as if nothing is awry.  
Some estimates indicate that Calpers is in reality only 25 percent funded.  


Why is this not in the public square yet? It's obvious when looking at STRATOSPHERIC valuations"

1720,"What is a Trader (Honest Opinion) Note: English is not my first language, so I apologize for any errors, but I believe the most important thing is the message I want to convey. I think the text below will add value to your life as a trader.  
  
\*\*Trading Schools\*\*  
  
Price Action... works  
  
SMC... works  
  
ICT... maybe works (I know very little about it)  
  
Indicators... work  
  
Fundamental analysis... works  
  
Each trading school has its advantages and disadvantages, so master it from basic to advanced knowledge. Gain knowledge to put into practice.  
  
\*\*When I think of a trader, I think of two areas/professions\*\*  
  
1. High-performance athlete: look at Cristiano Ronaldo, Lewis Hamilton, Michael Phelps, Lewis Hamilton, Serena Williams, and many others. They do the same thing countless times, seeking to improve physical and mental aspects to achieve their goals gradually and consistently, striving for excellence at all times.  
2. Artists: You may know how to play Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, but you will never be Beethoven; he was unique. Artists create their own style, their own signature. So stop trying to copy strategies or trading styles from someone; inspiration is not a copy.  
  
\*\*Gurus and Influencers\*\*  
  
Avoid videos with catchy thumbnails and titles, or influencers with screenshots of high results or photos of a luxurious life; most of them are monetizing your attention, either through ads or selling courses. Many times, these people don't even engage in trading. There are many individuals with technical/academic knowledge and market reputation, people with theses, reputable books, but the majority of people shy away from knowledge and prefer a 15-minute video.  
  
\*\*You don't need money to start\*\*  
  
Unlike any other field, in the financial market, you can open an account with a broker and have a completely free demo account with entirely free platforms. Use this as an advantage to conduct your backtests and forward testing. The internet is vast; look for books or academic articles that bring knowledge into your life; finding a PDF nowadays is quite simple.  
  
And to conclude the most important point...  
  
\*\*A trader needs to make trades to be a trader\*\*  
  
Yes, it's obvious, but not everyone practices it. A trader doesn't spend countless hours watching video courses, browsing hundreds of blogs, forums, and social networks looking for the holy grail of indicators or the perfect strategy. Develop your strategy based on your technical knowledge. Don't just stick to theories; you need to spend countless hours in front of charts, learn about scientific methodology, and incorporate it into your style. Have clear rules in your trades and keep things simple.

2978,"Lost 5.17M BEAM in Phishing Scam A victim lost about 5.17 MILLION in BEAM tokens a few hours ago.

So far the VICTIM's funds haven't gone to any deposit addresses and are still sitting in the scammer's wallets.

However, I am seeing other victim's funds going into various FixedFloat and ChangeNOW deposit addresses.

Below are the wallets connected to the 5.17M victim.

# The Wallets

Victim Wallet

* 0x83664B8a83b9845Ac7b177DF86d0F5BF3b7739AD - 5.17M BEAM VICTIM

# Inside the Scam

[Above is mapping where the txns of 0x98C6ceD9b18d57Ee58820e61AA126c0fec30435d - 5.17M BEAM Scammer 1 went. All of the funds are still sitting in the intermediary wallets at the time of this post.](https://preview.redd.it/c7rwugmxsvic1.png?width=1674&format=png&auto=webp&s=4184ee39d42280ecaf25ab6f16428b74da807af4)

# How the Phishing Scam Works

I'm showing interactions with Angel Drainer. Angel Drainer is a Scam as a Service platform that drains victims wallets once a user signs a malicious contract. 

0x6f167B86443D04f4b1705A0c78b6cC6Ac691e381 - 5.17M BEAM Scammer 2 appears to be the drainer wallet in this instance. I'm not sure this if wallet is Angel Drainer, but it operates very similarly.

This victim appears to have signed an Increase Allowance transaction. This function grants the scammer approval for ALL or infinite tokens.

# Where's the Money Going?

[A different look inside 0x98C6ceD9b18d57Ee58820e61AA126c0fec30435d - 5.17M BEAM Scammer 1.](https://preview.redd.it/kvt99dervvic1.png?width=2018&format=png&auto=webp&s=77e93b57b1363287015fca60678413f2dfc922f9)

The scammer swapped all the BEAM tokens into ETH.

As of this moment, about 425K worth of ETH is sitting inside the scammer's primary wallet of 0x98C6ceD9b18d57Ee58820e61AA126c0fec30435d. 

There's 200 ETH in each of the intermediary wallets. This totals out to be about 3.39M of the VICTIMS funds. 

If law enforcement is able to act quickly, there's still a chance that a significant portion of the funds can  be recovered once they hit the exchanges.

Lastly of interest to me is the Angel Drainer interactions. I did notice about 16K worth of ETH went into the Angel Drainer wallet, presumably fees from other victims.

# Wallets of Interest

Outside of the wallets I mentioned above, there's a few that need further investigation. Sometimes it's the small breadcrumbs that can lead to an identity. These wallet's pre-date this particular victim but they are directly connected to the scammer.

* 0x83664B8a83b9845Ac7b177DF86d0F5BF3b7739AD - 40.4K sitting in here
* 0xE30e38CE7BD5e67A84D1E281C6Cf03dC08D26fDf - MEXC, Sideshift, and ChangeNOW deposit addresses
* 0x251623efdAfCC7929f40b35D1a2FF4813e6065f5 - Connected to other scams

Thanks for reading and I hope this one has a happy ending for the victim!

2656,"Apple adds PQ3 quantum-resistant encryption to iMessage By now you've likely noticed that top companies are already implementing encryption that is prepared for quantum computing. 

These updates are needed for digital signatures that currently protect your keys.

Apple is doing this to protect your iMessage- I think we should have at least that same security for our crypto assets!

Typically, someone will say if quantum can hack your wallet,  everything will be vulnerable.   

And that's right- which is why Apple and Google and Governments and Military and Banks and everyone else are preparing or already implementing solutions.  We are sleeping at the wheel. 

We can't just sit back and say this will be quickly and easily fixed when the time comes.   If crypto isn't prepared like everyone else,  it will be an easy target.  To gain consensus,  build, and  test we likely will need years.   Plus we need to give people time to transition assets to a new set of keys that aren't vulnerable.  I'm not sure what we'll do with old wallets from the Satoshi days.   There is a lot of btc sitting there,  and many have even older encryption that is vulnerable even if they never transacted. 

When we do try to transition, asking users to adopt wallets they don't know will not go well. 

I would like to see top coins implement a cross signing model like Qanplatform has built.  

This will allow users to continue using evm wallets they know and trust.  That will limit disruption and allow us to continue using the ecosystem that's been developed. 

To create wider adoption, cryptocurrency should be leading this effort for secure digital assets.  And it needs to start now.   There are too many advancements in quantum computing and more efficient algos to ignore.

Banks only have a fraction of the money they owe us and if they invested our money in bonds they probably made a lot of unrealized losses because of rising interest rates.

If we can start a bank run by all going to a certain bank(preferably a small one) and start massively withdrawing money for example on coming Sunday we can make the bank insolvent because we force them to liquidate their unrealized losses. The stock price of the bank wil crash and if we short it we can make a lot of money. We just need to find a small bank with unrealized losses that we Will all go to on a certain day, start withdrawing money and create media attention that a bank run is happening. If the bank goes bankrupt we won’t lose our savings in the bank because the governement guarantees our money up to $250.000. Everybody with more than $250.000 will start withdrawing like crazy.

*****
> Stock futures rose as traders looked ahead to Friday’s May jobs report and cheered lawmakers passing a debt ceiling bill that averts a U.S. default.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 157 points, or 0.5%, while S&P 500 futures added 0.5%. Nasdaq-100 futures rose 0.5%.
*****
> Lululemon shares popped 14% in the premarket on strong results and a guidance boost, while MongoDB surged 23% after hours on a blowout forecast.
*****
> Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect that growth eased in May over the previous month, with 190,000 jobs added versus the 253,000 gained in April. That would mark the lowest monthly gain since December 2020.
*****
> Investors will look through the report for clues on the Federal Reserve’s futures policy moves.
*****
> Easing concerns around the U.S. debt ceiling also helped sentiment. The Senate passed a bill to raise the debt ceiling late Thursday night, sending the bill to President Joe Biden’s desk. That comes after the House passed the Fiscal Responsibility Act on Wednesday, just days before the June 5 deadline set by U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.
*****
> Fear that the U.S. may default on its obligations if lawmakers failed to reach an agreement rattled some investors earlier in the week.
*****
> “I do think markets were pretty savvy this time: They kind of priced in some sort of resolution, but because we’re taking a tail risk off the table, we’re getting a bit of relief here,” said Mona Mahajan, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones.
*****
> Investors may also be finding some solace in the likelihood of very limited economic impact from the recent debt ceiling fiasco and a cap on spending that appears unlikely to weigh on economic growth in a “meaningful way,” she added.
*****
> Stocks kicked off the new trading month on a positive note Thursday. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite gained 0.99% and 1.28%, respectively, to settle at their highest levels since August. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 153.3 points, or 0.47%.
*****
> As the week draws to a close, both the S&P and Nasdaq are on track to finish with modest gains of 0.37% and 0.97%. The Dow sits 0.1% lower for the week as of Thursday’s close.

4287,"Anti-BTC sentiment from people frustrated by inflation Whenever I see bitcoin mentioned in other subs, it’s usually as a punchline. Especially during the anti-billionaire/anti-capitalist discussions that seem so prevalent on Reddit.

The people that are the most vocally frustrated about the declining power of the dollar, or about how much easier it was for previous generations to buy a home, start a family, etc. seem to be the ones most dismissive of btc - which was designed specifically to combat the machine they are raging against.

9579,"Xrp - getting rich for the wrong reasons I feel like, between different cryptos, the success of XRP as the reserve currency is more likely to lead to a permanent surveillance state where people are getting their eyeballs scanned for monthly credits for food. 

Whereas the success of a more open blockchain is more likely to lead to a future where freedom wins, and we get to a world that is permisionless. 

What are your thoughts?

I agree the XRP ledger is decentralized in function, but unfortunately, it's not decentralized in token ownership (ripple owns half). 

I also think ripple would sell out at the first chance. They are a corporation, their goal is to be profitable.

We are at a precipice here!!! Crypto and AI could take the world in either direction. Utopian or surveillance state.

What are your thoughts? Hoping not to hear people say ""if I'm rich, who cares?"".

Who wants to be rich in a soulless apocalypse? There'd be no economy and nothing fun to buy.

1764,"How would you construct a portfolio based around an all-world index combined with factors? Lately I have been educating myself more about using factors to set additional focuses in an all-world portfolio (only equity part of the portfolio, disregarding bonds, cash, ressources and real estate) and try to increase returns. However, I am not sure how I would implement factors in an all-world portfolio. Say I have a 100% VWCE portfolio now, how would you start to complement it with different factor indices? I was thinking about going a 70/30 route, but instead of making it about Wolrd/EM, making it All-World/factors. One possiblity would be to add different world factor ETFs. Say an MSCI World value, quality, small cap and momentum ETF in a, say, 10/10/5/5 ratio. Another possiblity I thought about is using an equal weighted world ETF. The equal weighted S&P 500 has historically (going back decades, not just the recent past) outperformed the market weighted ETF, so using an equal weighted world ETF seems to make sense instead of the VWCE world. Here a ratio of 70/30 with factors seems reasonable to me as well. Does anyone here run a similar equity portfolio to this? I ran it through Morningstars x-ray and it looked promising. I couldn't find any literature on someone running a portfolio like this though."
2144,"Realize SOXL & Crypto gains or keep holding? Throughout all of 2023, I was consistently buying SOXL, allocating roughly 20% of my investment budget to it.  I have a high risk tolerance, but due to its performance, at this point SOXL makes up around 25% of my portfolio. That combined with my crypto holdings is making me consider rebalancing. Currently my portfolio, crypto + equities, looks roughly like the following:

SOXL - $70,600, QQQ  - $61,600, VOO  - $59,000, IWY   - $57,000, XLE   - $6,200, Ethereum - $36,500, Bitcoin - $48,000

My question is how would you proceed here?  Rebalance now in one fell swoop?  Rebalance continuously as FIFO shares reach 1 year (long term capital gains)? Don’t sell anything, just stop buying SOXL / crypto and rebalance through purchasing the other ETFs?

For context, 30M in VHCOL city.  This is all just my brokerage account - my 401k is much lower risk.  "

7266,"Sprott Analyst on the four key takeaways from a site visit at Surge Battery Metals (NILI.v NILIF) Nevada North Lithium Project: 20x to 80x Potential # ""The stock is trading at US$10/t LCE in-situ pre-resource vs reserve peers at US$200-800/t (LAC, Ioneer, American Li), a gap that we think closes fast on very few drillholes""

**On a significant upward trend, up over 115% in the past 6 months, Surge Battery Metals (NILI.v NILIF) has positioned itself as a stand-out opportunity in the battery metals industry with its Nevada North discovery.**

https://preview.redd.it/rnnny951hleb1.jpg?width=1534&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ce8b8e261fe3ec534d36148f89669095f4fa69a

Encompassing \~2,452 total hectares and 303 mineral claims, the Nevada North Lithium Project boasts significant lithium content ranging from 29.1 ppm to 5,120 ppm, including 274 samples of 508 carrying 1,000 ppm Li or greater.

From a Sprott Analyst following a site visit this week, the key takeaways from the Nevada North Project are:

**1) Lithium content currently comparable to and with the potential to exceed LAC's Thacker Pass**

* Thacker pass is the largest North American lithium project with 3.6Mt @ 3,160ppm P&P
* Over 300 holes have been drilled at Thacker Pass; One of the 8 holes NILI has drilled so far exceeds all of Thacker's holes by both length and grade.
* CPe 2.7-3.4Mt LCE @ 3,369ppm from the first 8 holes at Nevada North
* The first 8 sonic core holes planned at Nevada North aim to double the footprint to 3000m x 1200m of the initial scout RC which could easily double NILI's estimates towards SCPe 10Mt LCE ahead of the maiden resource in 4Q23

**2) Lithium grade at Nevada North is 2-3 times higher than peers**

* The grade, early metallurgy and geometry at NN make it a stand-out project with a higher grade layer exceeding 38000ppm starting from the surface for a quicker payback

**3) Excellent infrastructure: Road access, powerline in close proximity, no obvious permitting red flags and detailed EA work underway**

**4) The Ex-Millennial Lithium Team is back together**

* ""CEO Greg Reimer and Chairman Graham Harris brought the ex-Millennial Lithium team back together to do it again""
* Millennial Lithium was acquired by LAC for US $490M

The analysts closed with, *""The stock is trading at US$10/t LCE in-situ pre-resource vs reserve peers at US$200-800/t (LAC, Ioneer, American Li), a gap that we think closes fast on very few drillholes""*, further emphasizing the significance of this opportunity with the amalgamation of the above reasons hinting at a potential 20x-80x bagger.

6425,"Cancer research and breakthroughs in partnership with artificial intelligence. $IDNA One of the most exciting medicines of the past year have been GLP-1  drugs taking the spotlight but i think major breakthroughs and  development in the oncology space are coming this year, specifically  with genomic and mRNA treatments, and i think AI will accelerate our  progress. This is the new space race, we cant let the Russians win.   

mRNA and genomic research hold great promise in revolutionizing  cancer treatment and potentially offering a cure. One key advantage is  in the personalized approach they offer. Researching a persons genetics   enables scientists to understand the genetic makeup of individual  tumors, leading to a tailored treatment that targets the specific  mutations driving cancer growth. By analyzing the unique genetic  signatures of tumors, researchers can identify vulnerabilities and  develop mRNA-based therapies that precisely instruct the immune system  to recognize and destroy cancer cells.   

mRNA has demonstrated remarkable versatility and safety in  delivering the treatment. Unlike traditional treatments such as  chemotherapy and radiation (Nuking the immune system), which can cause  severe side effects due to their nonspecific targeting, mRNA vaccines  and therapies have shown the ability to selectively target cancer cells  while sparing healthy tissues. This targeted approach minimizes adverse  effects and enhances the effectiveness of treatment, offering new hope  to patients battling various forms of cancer.   

I think **the true benefit** that humanity will have  from AI is disease research. The significant contribution of AI lies in  its ability to analyze huge amounts of data efficiently and accurately.  In cancer research, AI algorithms can sift through extensive genomic  data, medical records, imaging scans, and scientific literature to  identify patterns, correlations, and potential treatment options that  might otherwise be overlooked by human researchers. What normally would  take years can now take days or weeks.

2333,"Index fund: What are historical returns for quarterly vs monthly dollar cost averaging Main questions:
1)Is there a historical returns calculator where I can compare results for quarterly dollar cost averaging vs monthly? 
I could only find calculators with a monthly one. 

2)Historically,are returns higher if you dollar cost average monthly vs quarterly? 

Background/context


The reason why I am asking this is simple: I am buying NASDQ and S&P500 based in Eurooean stock exchanges because they have to be UCITs compliant and none of those are available in US stock markets. 

These ETFs are identical to the ones traded in the US and have barely any differences in returns unless they are hedged to another currency which increases or decreases returns based on the exchange rate. 

European stock exchanges have high comissions and clearing fees and bigger volumes mean it's cheaper for me to invest quarterly vs monthly.

The second reason I invest quarterly is because I need to maintain a high amount of savings for a number of reasons and that treshold is a minimum of 9 months of savings. 

I could list those reasons but that would make this post unnecessarily long.

**Mawson Infrastructure( $MIGI, $1.60),** is a Bitcoin miner that has mysteriously NOT been participating in the Bitcoin miner rally over the past few weeks. Despite reporting last week very impressive Bitcoin production for the month of January--174 Bitcoin--and revenues over $7 Million, representing a 300% vs. January 2023. MIGI also added another hosted (co-location) contract with another client with 1,176 in the latest mining machines (currently being deployed). Great news overall, but MIGI price is lagging as Bitcoin price is now over $51,000.  **Why? The answer may be in the After Market press release on Friday--MIGI apparently is clawing back shares from the ex-CEO based on related party transactions.** Although it is difficult to quantify how many shares are involved (around 1.5 million shares may be the number), the recent weakness in MIGI may revlove arund the selling of shares SHORT --with collateral for the short pledged by these soon-to-be-clawbacked shares. Watch MIGI at Monday's market open. MIGI is trading at less than $28 million market cap--despite an annual revenue run rate of $90 million (at the current BTC price). This one has a long way to run if there is a forced short squeeze...  


**1847 Holdings. Inc. ($EFSH)** trading at $3.38 is a very undervalued play by any metric.  **At a market cap of $9.27 Million (and a public float of 735,000 shares)**,  EFSH reported revenues of $18.8 million in Third Quarter,2023 (Year over Year of increase of 30%) and a 65% increase in gross profit of $8 million. EFSH's business plan is a way for small investors to participate in the acquisition of undervalued private companies--and the company has a number of companies under its corporate umbrella. Founders and/or stakeholders of many small companies with limited exit options despite the underlying (and unrecognized) value of their business are the acquisition targets of EFSH. **Shareholders of EFSH can look forward periodic special stock dividends through future IPO's of portfolio companies that EFSH acquires, develops and builds shareholder value.** A quick look at the company's recent press releases shows substantial news on balance sheet improvement with $6.4 million of outstanding debt and liabilities being  eliminated over just the past week. EFSH  [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1847-holdings-hunt-small-business-133000009.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1847-holdings-hunt-small-business-133000009.html) Significantly, the CEO with deep Private equity experience, recently gave **annual revenue guidance of $90 million** for the next 12 months. Stock chart looks good with a positive trend coming off a base.

Good luck in this week's trading."

1141,"Thoughts on ACMR Stock and Its Future Prospects? Hey everyone,

I've been closely following ACMR and its performance in the market, especially with the recent developments surrounding the company. They've recently opened a new facility in Hillsboro, Oregon which seems like a significant step forward in expanding their operations. Additionally, ACMR has updated their revenue outlook, suggesting a more optimistic future than previously anticipated. Their outlook on 2023 revenue from $530 to $545 million and projected 2024 revenue of $650 to $725 million

For people who don't know the company they specialize in developing, manufacturing, and selling single-wafer wet cleaning equipment, which is crucial for the production of advanced semiconductors. Their technology is designed to remove particles and contaminants from semiconductor wafers, improving the overall yield and reliability of semiconductor devices. 

Also their earnings have beaten expectations previous times. 

""For the quarter ended in November 2023, ACMR reported earnings of $0.57 per share, which beat the consensus estimate of $0.34 per share by $0.23.
https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/ACMR/earnings/

In the second quarter of 2023, ACMR reported quarterly earnings of $0.48 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.10 per share "". 
https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/acm-research-inc-acmr-q2-110506735.html

Considering all these positive developments, particularly in the semiconductor sector where ACMR operates, I wonder why the stock hasn't seen a more substantial increase in its value. 

I'm curious to hear your thoughts on this. Why do you think ACMR stock hasn't shot up as much as one might expect from a company with such positive indicators? Is there something I'm missing, or is the market not fully appreciating ACMR's potential? Any insights, analyses, or predictions you have would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks for sharing your thoughts!"

1859,"Thoughts on SNPS and CDNS? Synopsys (SNPS) and Cadence (CDNS) are a near-duopoly in the EDA space (chip-design software and related), and both are popping nicely today (7% and 5% at the moment), undoubtedly due to NVIDIA’s rise today (15% atm), since NVIDIA is a major customer for both.  Both of these EDA stocks have had massive rises in the past decade (13x and 19x), and are now at P/Es of 73 and 80 respectively.

What are your thoughts on these two companies, and their stocks?  Obviously they should reflect the chip market, but are these PEs sustainable?  Any potential big risks on the horizon for the chip market?

3391,"Element79 Gold Reports Multiple High Grade Results from Pillune Area, Lucero Project, Arequipa, Peru (CSE:ELEM, OTC:ELMGF, FSE:7YS) &#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9s44tuei1zgc1.png?width=461&format=png&auto=webp&s=597bdd296093d8cc4e5b857a65be3d601349a3f6

Vancouver, BC – TheNewswire - February 6, 2024 – **Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) (FSE:7YS0)** (""Element79 Gold"", the ""Company"") is pleased to announce additional underground chip sample assay results from the 2023 work campaign at the Pillune Area of the Lucero mine project in Arequipa, Peru.

HIGHLIGHTS:

* Assays from 2023 underground grab- and channel samples completed by SLM Resource Group from the Pillune Area of the past-producing Lucero mine project have been received, reviewed and reporting here
* Multi-ounce Gold and Multi-ounce Silver, reinforce the significant potential of restarting this past-producing mine today
   * 10.5 oz/t Gold and 29 oz/t Silver in sample LUC2023-33
   * 4.7 oz/t Gold and 29 oz/t Silver in Sample LUC2023-34
* Further lab assays from remaining 2023 work campaigns are being received shortly and will be released as soon as available.

“This batch of 24 assay results from the 2023 underground sampling program conducted by  contractor SLM Resource Group completed on the Pillune Area of the Lucero project revealed impressively high-grade gold and silver mineralization, up to 10.5 ounces per ton gold and >29 ounces per ton silver, in addition to some great base metals results.  This is encouraging to us as it further validates the potential for a significant high-grade future operation.” said James Tworek, CEO and Director of Element79 Gold.

The assay results were collected during the 2023 program consists of underground chip samples across several veins from the Apacheta Zone which retuned up to 11.7 oz/t gold and 247 oz/t silver (see April 27th 2024 news release), Pillune Area (the focus of this release), and Sando Alcalde

Area, where local Informal miners have worked sporadically for the last several years. The 2023 work program carried out by SLM Resource Group revealed high-grade gold-silver mineralization confirming two orientations of mineralized structures. These comprise a roughly E-W orientation associated with higher precious metals and a more NW orientation associated with higher base metals, both with economic grades (Table 1.).

""The latest assay results confirm the high-grade nature of the Lucero project, consistent with visible mineralization observed during our team’s site visits and by prior operators,"" said James Tworek, CEO of Element79 Gold. ""We have the benefit of a running start as the Lucero project has been in production in the past, local artisanal miners are actively working in the region today, and barring annual rainy season conditions, many underground workings remain accessible.  These new results provide high-grade results from SLM’s 2023 campaign on the Pillune Area of Lucero and continue to encourage our belief that the project hosts significant commercially exploitable veins as it has seen little modern exploration.  We await one more batch of assays from the SLM campaign, as well as the results of the mapping and more thorough channel sampling campaign carried out by the Ore Discovery team, which ended on December 31st.  We look forward to sharing additional results shortly, as lab results are received.""

Tworek added, ""These positive results, along with historical data are being modeled and analyzed to produce underground and surface drill targets for our upcoming drill program.  We look forward to updating our investors on additional results from the 2023 work campaigns as we receive and analyze them. ""

**About the Lucero Project**

Formerly operated as the Shila mine from 1989 to 2005 by Buenaventura (NASDAQ:BVN), Lucero consists of 10,813 hectares located in the Shila range of southern Peru, which contains several historic high-grade gold-silver mines. Lucero consistently delivered high grades during 16 years of operations, and between 1998 and 2004 reported production averaging approximately 18,800 ounces of gold and 435,000 ounces of silver per year at grades of 14.0 g/t gold and 373 g/t silver, with recoveries at the ore processing facility averaging 94.5% for gold and 85.5% for silver.

**QA/QC**

All samples were collected by Helmut Herrera of SLM Mining Services S.A.C of Peru (Lima) and submitted to Certimin  S.A. of Peru (Lima). Samples were prepared by crushing to 90% passing <2mm, with a 250-gram split pulverized to 85% passing 75 micrometers, and analysed by four acid digestion followed by Inductively Couple Plasma with an Optical  Emission Spectrophotometry detector (ICP-OES) for 35 elements including silver, while gold was analyzed by Fire Assay with a 30-gram sample with an Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry detector (AAS) finish for assay up to 10 g/t. Overlimit gold was analysed by fire assay with a gravimetric finish. Overlimit Silver (>100 g/t) was analysed by four acid digestion and AAS finish.  Overlimit lead and zinc were analysed by ore grade techniques using four acid digestion and ICP-OES finish.

**About Element79 Gold Corp**

Element79 Gold Corp is a gold and silver mining company committed to maximizing shareholder value through responsible mining practices and sustainable development of its projects.  Element79 Gold's core focus is on developing its past-producing, high-grade gold and silver mine, the Lucero project located in Arequipa, Peru, with the intent to restart production in 2024.  In January 2024 the Company entered into a non-binding LOI with Compañía de Minas Buenaventura regarding the potential offtake of minerals produced from the Lucero project.

The Company also holds a portfolio of 5 properties along the Battle Mountain trend in Nevada, with the Clover and West Whistler projects believed to have significant potential for near-term resource development. Three properties in the Battle Mountain Portfolio are under contract for sale to Valdo Minerals Ltd., with an anticipated closing date in the first half of 2024.  The Company has also signed an Option Agreement to sell the Maverick Springs project, an advanced-stage exploratory property with an Inferred Resource of 3.71Moz AuEq (1.37Moz Au and 175Moz Ag) and anticipates completing this sale on or before July 21, 2024.  

In British Columbia, Element79 Gold has executed a Letter of Intent and funded a drilling program to acquire a private company that holds the option to 100% interest of the Snowbird High-Grade Gold Project, which consists of 10 mineral claims located in Central British Columbia, approximately 20km west of Fort St. James.

The Company has an option to acquire a 100% interest in the Dale Property, 90 unpatented mining claims located approximately 100 km southwest of Timmins, Ontario, and has recently announced that it has transferred this project to its wholly-owned subsidiary, Synergy Metals Corp, and is advancing through the Plan of Arrangement spin-out process.

The Company’s 2023 review and Corporate Update can be reviewed in comment.

1293,"Q1 Earnings - Starbucks earnings disappoint as sales outside the U.S. lag Starbucks on Tuesday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that missed Wall Street’s expectations as both domestic and international sales fell short of estimates.

CEO Laxman Narasimhan said in a statement that the chain faced “headwinds,” but the brand remains strong.

Shares initially fell in extended trading but recovered, rising about 2%.

Here’s what the company reported for its fiscal first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: 90 cents adjusted vs. 93 cents expected

Revenue: $9.4 billion vs. $9.59 billion expected


The coffee giant reported fiscal first-quarter net income of $1.02 billion, or 90 cents per share, up from $855.2 million, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier.

Excluding restructuring costs and other items, Starbucks earned 90 cents per share.

Net sales rose 8% to $9.4 billion. Global same-store sales increased 5%, falling short of StreetAccount estimates of 7.2%.

In North America, same-store sales also rose 5%, driven largely by customers spending more on their drinks and food.

Starbucks’ fiscal first quarter encompasses the all-important holiday season. The chain usually nets billions of dollars in gift card sales, plus higher traffic fueled by its seasonal drink offerings and thirsty shoppers.

Outside of Starbucks’ home market, the coffee chain reported international same-store sales growth of 7%, missing expectations of 13.2%.

China, the company’s second-largest market, reported same-store sales growth of 10%. However, the average ticket at its Chinese stores fell 9%.

The chain has seen increased competition from lower-priced rivals like Luckin Coffee, which have won over consumers as China’s economic recovery continues to lag.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

We wicked to $0.628. So that means the bottom's in right? Right??

Sorry.. But even if XRP closes above $0.67, the daily RSI is going to be back below 70. I wouldn't even be surprised if we see a green hourly wick go back as high as $0.68 (unlikely but possible). However with the daily RSI back below 70, another leg down is all but assured. More over, because this move occured after completing a wyckoff distribution pattern, which this first pull back marks the final phase of, the voracity of this first pull back makes me even more confident it's going to be more painful than not. Suggesting that instead of price bottoming somewhere around $0.58-$0.59 (which was what I was hoping we'd see) it's looking more like our bottom is more likely to be around $0.54-$0.55.

I'd be remissed if I didn't state, TA isn't a science. Nothing is ever certain when trading, and this is especially true of crypto markets. It doesn't matter how strong your pattern recognition is, how accurately and perfectly you utilize and understand the TA tools you utilize in pricing markets. The markets will get the better of you. This is why no matter what you should never expose yourself to more risk than you're able to stomach. This is important not just for the sake of peace of mind, but also to help keep your emotions in check/out of the equation in regards to your analysis.

Warren Buffet famously stated; “The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.” But I feel amore accurate assessment is that markets move in such a way that they transfer money from emotional reactivist to proactive stoics.

As always, I do not recommend anyone trade based off of my calls. I'm 2/0 in the last week, it's only a matter of time until I get humbled."

4598,"Rumble's Unexpected Diversity & Bitcoin's Autonomy Revolution Let's delve into some intriguing parallels between the digital content realm and our own world of cryptocurrency. It's a common misconception that platforms like Rumble cater exclusively to a conservative or libertarian audience. Yet, the reality reveals a more nuanced picture, with a slight lean towards Democrat supporters. This piece of insight shatters the binary political narrative, spotlighting a widespread demand for uncensored content across the spectrum. It's a powerful reminder that the quest for free expression transcends political affiliations, echoing a sentiment well understood within our community.

As the traditional social media giants like YouTube grapple with censorship, Rumble emerges as a beacon for those seeking unfiltered content. This trend mirrors our own pursuit for financial autonomy in the face of centralized control. Bitcoin's cyclical resurgence, peaking every four years, isn't merely a speculative pattern; it's a testament to a growing movement towards decentralization and freedom from governmental oversight. In a world increasingly dominated by fiat manipulation, cryptocurrencies offer a haven, a form of wealth that's both permissionless and decentralized.

This shift towards Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is driven by a collective unease with the status quo, much like the move away from mainstream media to platforms like Rumble. It illustrates the ""balloon effect"" - pressure applied in one area will cause expansion in another, a concept that resonates deeply with our community's values.

We're at a pivotal crossroads in the quest for digital and financial sovereignty. The rise of alternative platforms and the increasing embrace of Bitcoin signal a deeper societal yearning for control over our lives and finances.

Let's open up the conversation: How do you see these developments influencing the future of financial freedom and autonomy? Are we merely adapting to the inevitable, or are we spearheading a revolution that redefines the very essence of freedom in the digital age?

Looking forward to your insights and discussions.

3809,"The Circular Economy and Best-practice Mining : St-Georges Eco-Mining Corp (CSE: SX, OTCQB: SXOOF, FSE:85G1) Sometimes, going around in circles is a good thing. Also, as Einstein said, “Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.” The point of the circular economy refutes that as the industry wants to do the same thing repeatedly and get the same result. It is a significant plank in regulating GHG and moderating mining and other fossil fuel processes. This further quote by AE is equally relevant when applied to modern-day GHG issues.

Thankfully, I’m not going to list stats and other dross that will be true; you can practically get the info on the back of a Coke bottle.

Here’s the skinny.

https://preview.redd.it/72wu8g4puw8c1.png?width=325&format=png&auto=webp&s=68fca1f923cad31273efe57b2fce1ec2eb36fd5d

**Is Mining Bad?**

The circular economy is a system where materials never become waste and nature regenerates. In a circular economy, products and materials are circulated through maintenance, reuse, refurbishment, remanufacture, recycling, and composting.

From the mining production point of view, practices include reducing water and energy consumption, minimizing land disturbance and waste production, preventing soil, water, and air pollution at mine sites, and conducting successful mine closures and reclamation activities. Can more be done?

Sure.

Top 10 behemoths that subscribe and have major commitments to employing the circular economy processes. The details of each company are here. (sustainability mag)

* Patagonia
* Ikea
* Unilever
* Accenture
* H&M
* Adidas
* Interface
* TrusTrace
* Mud Jean

One example is number 10, Mud Jean. The Company uses recycled denim to make new pairs of jeans, which customers can lease for just under €10 per month. This initiative allows customers to avoid buying jeans they will rarely wear, thus contributing to a closed-material loop. To participate in the Mud Jeans leasing programme, customers can send in an old pair of jeans and receive their first month of leasing for free. From there, customers can continue their subscription and receive a new pair of Muds each month or end their subscription after the initial month.

Ba da bing ba da boom. Closed circle. No waste.

Are you looking for a junior in the space? Great miner and employs the circular economy process? Here. You’re welcome.

St-Georges Eco-Mining Corp **(CSE: SX) (OTCQB: SXOOF) (FSE:85G1)** St- Georges develops new technologies to solve some of the most common environmental problems in the mining sector, including maximizing metal recovery and full-circle battery recycling. The Company explores nickel and PGEs on the Manicouagan and Julie Projects on Quebec’s North Shore and has multiple exploration projects in Iceland, including Thor Gold.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wtcokj7quw8c1.png?width=328&format=png&auto=webp&s=d58d0c964ae45d6f907a62cdd23b80faf74a8a0f

The simple premise is that critical minerals—and hopefully all metals— will never cease to be recycled and never see the inside of a landfill. SX is at the cutting edge of that extremely worthwhile development. 

 And has a skookum looking chart.

Bears repeating.

**St-Georges Represents a Compelling Entry Point to the Eco-Mining sector.**

* The company is well-positioned to capture a significant share of the growing battery recycling market.
* The company is benefiting from the increasing focus on sustainability, driving demand for battery recycling.
* The company has a strong management team with a proven track record.
* The company is listed on the Toronto Venture Exchange (TSX-V), providing investors access to a liquid market. 

There are many other positives; the Spinout of Iceland Recourses, for example;

The decision to undertake the Spinout was prompted by the Company’s recent success in demonstrating, in addition to the Thor Project’s high level of productivity for gold, the broad untested potential for significant gold mineralization within the Elbow Creek Project. The Company believes that the Spinout is the most effective way to unlock the value of the Icelandic assets that relate to their gold potential.

Recently, financing yielded the Company just under a million. Further, the Company has no debt.

It is worth your time and potentially a purchase for risk-oriented people who want to bridge the relationship between lower GHG, best-practice mining and the Circular Economy."

And you have lost faith in it.

For easy figures say you purchased 5000 worth, now it’s worth 1000. So you own 50 shares.

As an alternative of selling and taking the loss, would buying whatever number of shares you need to average down to the current €20 price ever make sense?

In this example, roughly you’d need to buy another 4000 shares @€20 = €80000. €85000 / 4050 shares = €21 So assuming you had enough money to buy another €80000 worth and then cash out at a breakeven BEP, would this be just stupid as my instinct suggests or is there ever a valid circumstance or scenario to do this?

Just wondering ha"

7270,"Wells Fargo (WFC) to pay $1 billion compensation to shareholders, after concealing compliance issues from investors The story started in 2016 when **Wells Fargo created millions of unauthorized customer accounts** and imposed auto insurance on hundreds of thousands of clients.

  
Following that, in 2018, Federal Reserve issued several orders requiring to improve client practices and governance at Wells Fargo. For years the bank has been working under consent orders and reported to investors significant improvements over the past situation and did not mention any compliance issues.

  
Until Marth 2020, when governmental reports revealed the fact that **Wells Fargo is unable to stop harming its customers** and comply with the issued earlier orders. Right after the reports were published **stock plunged from 47$ to $30 causing investors billions in losses.**

  
And just now, **Wells Fargo decided to pay its shareholders $1 billion in compensation** while denying all the allegations. Attorneys will take up to 19% of that sum, everything else will go directly to the shareholders.

9963,"How does xrp work? I’m a long holder of xrp but admittedly I (and seemingly many others) don’t understand how the token is supposed to work.

If the goal is to make cheap cross border payments and save money, why would banks spend billions and even trillions to own and use xrp? I’m basing those numbers on how much money it would take for xrp to reach even just single/double digit prices.

People argue market cap doesn’t matter and that the price must be high, but if the “switch was flipped” and the price was set ludicrously high, it would immediately plummet from sellers taking insane profits, no?

I can understand realistically the price getting back to ATH and more if it is widely adopted, but how do some holders genuinely believe it can do any more than that given the basic principle of supply and demand.

I’ve heard about tokenization and it being pegged to commodities but how does that affect the price? Does xrp assume the price of an ounce of gold? With 100 billion xrp,how many are actually needed to complete the volume of global transactions in a day?

This isn’t FUD btw, I genuinely just don’t understand how xrp is used and how the price is affected beyond speculation."

3265,"Kraken Energy Corp. (UUSA.c) Seizes Opportunity Amid Uranium Market Resurgence: Restarting Phase I Drilling at Harts Point Property With the uranium market experiencing a significant upswing in light of the increasing demand for carbon-free nuclear energy, Kraken Energy Corp. (Ticker: UUSA.c or UUSAF for US investors) restarted the Phase I drilling program at its Harts Point Uranium Property in Southern Utah. 

Harts Point, strategically located within the Colorado Plateau, is recognized for its storied history of production. Covering 2,622 hectares, the property comprises 324 lode mining claims on Bureau of Land Management territory.

Of significance is the Harts Point Anticline, geologically comparable to the productive Lisbon Valley Anticline, which has historically yielded approximately 280,000 lbs U₃O₈ at 0.3% U₃O₈ from the favorable Chinle Formation host rock.

The infrastructure around Harts Point, which is just 64 km north of the White Mesa uranium processing facility, provides convenient access, enhancing operational efficiencies for Kraken Energy.

https://preview.redd.it/mzr9qeyrrfic1.png?width=1005&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9ec8a4ede57853f75e9252bbf90f7a28fe5cec4

The decision to resume drilling is underpinned by the potential for significant uranium deposits, supported by historical exploration wells revealing 'off-scale' radioactivity in the Chinle Formation host rock.

The drill program is expected to extend over a 5 km strike length and aims to evaluate the mineralized trend and unlock substantial uranium resources.

Kraken Energy's decision to resume drilling at Harts Point signifies a strategic pivot aimed at maximizing near-term opportunities. The company's commitment to operational efficiency positions it for sustained success in the dynamic uranium exploration landscape.

*****
> Stock futures rose slightly Thursday after the U.S. House passed a debt ceiling bill in a crucial step to avoid a U.S. default, with the measure now moving it to the Senate.
*****
> Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 8 points, or 0.2%. S&P 500 futures gained 0.2% along with Nasdaq-100 futures.
*****
> The Fiscal Responsibility Act passed by a vote of 314-117 with bipartisan support. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he hopes “we can move the bill quickly here in the Senate and bring it to the president’s desk as soon as possible.”
*****
> Concern over a possible U.S. debt default lingered on Wall Street throughout May — which concluded Wednesday. Last month was also marked by a dramatic rally in artificial intelligence-related stocks.
*****
> The Nasdaq Composite ended May with a 5.8% gain as enthusiasm around AI continued to boost related stocks. Chipmaker Nvidia jumped 36% in May, briefly touching a $1 trillion market cap this week. Alphabet, Meta and Amazon all rose at least 10% during the month.
*****
> Outside of tech, gains were hard to come by, however. The S&P 500 inched up 0.3% in the month, while the blue-chip Dow fell almost 3.5%, dragged down by Nike, Walt Disney and Chevron.
*****
> “We have been impressed by the resilience of this market since the March low, absorbing a relentless onslaught of negative sentiment and headlines,” said Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Sandler.
*****
> Beyond the debt ceiling battle, investors are looking ahead to the Federal Reserve’s June 13-14 policy meeting as another possible market catalyst. Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said Wednesday that he’s leaning toward skipping a rate hike at the upcoming gathering. However, he added that Friday’s payrolls report could change his mind.
*****
> A slew of economic data is set for release Thursday, including weekly jobless claims and the purchasing managers’ index.
*****
> Nordstrom jumped 4% in premarket trading after its fiscal first-quarter sales beat Wall Street’s expectations. Salesforce shares fell about 6% after the software company bumped up its full-year forecast but reported higher capital expenses than expected.

3714,"How the algo works that delivered + 37.1% in dec. Some of you checking my comments, have asked about how I picked some of the winners in december (such as CELU, ACAD and VNCE). So here it goes.

I look for stocks that:
Are included in the Russel 2000 or are similar to stocks in that index.
Have been in >= 255 days downward trend that has now flattened out.
Are in a monthly or weekly squeeze.
Have a Book to Market that is >= 3.
Have a reward / risk ratio of >= 5.

When I find a good candidate, I risk 1% of my account, and set a quite generous stop; I don’t want to be stopped out because of intraday volatility, so I rather size down on my first unit. 
If / when the stocks starts moving in the direction I want, I add 1-2 more blocks and adjust my stops.
Quite early after take off, I take some profit (~ 25% of the position) to reduce risk.
When I’m totally scaled-in, and the first profit taker has triggered, I adjust to a trailing stop loss of 2 ATR (at entry date). So, that’s my exit.
When I have a really strong feeling about the stock, I add Calls (given decent price) risking 1% more, with an expiry far away. 

So, that’s a short list highlighting the approach. 👍"

1685,"Taiwan Semi (TSMC) will be 'back to strong growth in 2024' - JPMorgan (holding small position) Missing explosive Nvidia growth in 2023 my small play in AI has become TSMC (next to MSFT). This is the company that actually makes Nvidia's chips (and Alphabet's, and Apple's and many others). I had my eyes on ASML too, but it seems too expensive especially in the light of recent China export restrictions.

JPMorgan released a note today covering Taiwan Semi (TSMC), saying it expects will be back to strong growth in 2024, while the Intel competition concerns seem overstated;

*Analysts, who have a Buy rating on the stock, raised the TSMC price target to NT$750 from NT$700.The investment bank expects TSMC to bounce back to \~20% revenue growth in 2024, led by inventory restocking, strong AI demand, and the rapid expansion in N3.""Looking ahead, we believe N3 is likely to drive strong growth into 2025, while early progress on N2 looks promising, despite market concerns about competition,"" wrote the analysts.While Intel competition has been weighing down the stock, JPMorgan's analysis indicates Intel outsourcing to TSMC is likely to outweigh any market share Intel Foundry takes away from TSMC in the next three to four years.""In the near-term, we expect TSMC to guide for 1Q24 revs to decline only 3-4% QoQ and indicate a healthy demand recovery at 2024 in its upcoming earnings conference, although GMs may remain under pressure due to higher depreciation costs, N3 dilution, and strong TWD,"" added the analysts.*

3913,"Loaded up on Taurus Gold (TAUR) at $.05! I love uncovering undervalued stocks with huge potential, especially before a potential bull. I've been playing with Yukon Gold stocks, and my current fav is Taurus Gold Corp (CSE:TAUR, OTC:TARGF). This stock has caught my eye for several reasons - I’ll share why I think it's a smart buy right now.[Previous DD post on Taurus here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/17a2cgq/tintina_gold_province_dd4_taurus_gold_corp_cse/)

## Taurus Gold Corp - The Essentials:

* Current Price: An attractive $0.05 per share (TAUR)
* Market Cap: Approximately $2 million, suggesting significant growth potential.
* Strategic Location: Situated in the Northern Cordilleran Gold Province in Yukon, surrounded by mining heavyweights like Newmont, Victoria Gold, and Kinross.

## Why TAUR Stands Out:

* Strong Performance in 2023: This year, Taurus Gold has shown positive georesults, indicating a solid trajectory for growth and success.
* Board Changes: Recent changes to the board, including bringing in new members with extensive experience in the sector, signal a fresh and promising direction for the company.
* Proximity to Mining Giants: The presence of major mining companies in the immediate area is not just about prestige; it suggests a fertile ground for potential buyouts or strategic partnerships, which could significantly benefit Taurus Gold.
* Nearly 40m shares outstanding!

## My Investment Rationale:

* Gold Market Trends: With the gold market showing resilience and geopolitical instability, a gold-focused miner like Taurus Gold is well-positioned to benefit.
* Growth Prospects: The company's growth factor and recent positive developments paint a picture of a company on the rise. The team just needs to derisk.
* Potential for Buyouts: The strategic location of Taurus Gold, amidst some of the biggest names in the industry, opens up exciting possibilities for buyouts or collaborations, which could lead to substantial gains for the company and its investors.
* The stock seems to like to bounce around between $.07 - $.14. This is an opportunity for a little swing trading fun. This is my first time entering at $.05. Should be fun 😀

## Looking Ahead:

I'm particularly excited about Taurus Gold's future. The company's strategic moves, coupled with its location in a region rich in mining activity, position it as a potential target for acquisition by larger players in the industry."

# [Stock futures slip in early morning trading after tech-led rally](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/04/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures slipped in early morning trading Tuesday as traders continue to assess the bond market’s warning signals and the latest developments in the Ukraine-Russia war.
*****
> Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded 60 points lower, or 0.18%. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were down more than 0.1% each.
*****
> Treasury yields rose broadly Tuesday, but rates on some shorter-term bonds continued to trade above their longer-dated counterparts. The 5-year yield climbed to 2.6%, while the 30-year rate traded around 2.525%. However, the key part of the yield curve briefly uninverted Tuesday, with the 2-year yield trading marginally below its 10-year counterpart.
*****
> These so-called yield curve inversions have historically preceded recessions, so they are closely watched by investors.
*****
> Investors also kept an eye on Europe, as the war between Ukraine and Russia dragged on. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pledged to pursue allegations of war crimes against Russian forces, noting that more than 300 people were killed and tortured in a suburb near the capital of Kyiv. (Click here for the latest.)
*****
> “Markets have been resilient given the war in Ukraine, continued price pressures, and uncertain global economic outlook, with investors’ ‘buy the dip’ mentality driving equity returns,” said Mark Hackett, Nationwide’s chief of investment research.
*****
> Oil prices, which have shot up since the onset of the war amid concerns over supply disruptions, climbed Tuesday. West Texas Intermediate futures were up 0.9% at $104.23 per barrel. Brent crude gained 0.7% to $108.30.
*****
> Those moves come after a tech-led rally that saw the Nasdaq Composite rise 1.9% on Monday. Shares of Twitter surged 27% for its best day ever after Elon Musk disclosed a 9.2% passive stake in the social media company. On Tuesday, the stock was up another 1.8%.
*****
> The blue-chip Dow rose about 100 points to begin the trading week, while the S&P 500 advanced 0.8%, both posting their second straight day of gains.
*****
> “In the near-term, we believe indiscriminate selling has created attractive entry points, particularly into some high-growth-potential stocks,” Tony DeSpirito, CIO of U.S. fundamental equities at BlackRock, said in a note.
*****
> The new quarter has kicked off after the major averages finished their worst quarter in two years. Investors are awaiting the Federal Reserve meeting minutes Wednesday for further clues on the central bank’s rate-hike path. Meanwhile, the first-quarter corporate earnings season is set to begin next week.

*****
> Stock futures fell slightly on Friday morning as investors looked to close out a winning week for markets that saw better-than-expected economic growth and a pop in market-darling Tesla.
*****
> S&P 500 futures shed 0.28%, while Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.5%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded flat.
*****
> Earnings season continued, with Intel slumped more than 9% premarket following a dismal earnings report that missed on the top and bottom lines. Strong guidance boosted American Express despite a top-and bottom-line miss.
*****
> Stocks rose during regular trading Thursday, cheering a better-than-expected fourth quarter gross domestic product report that stoked hopes that the U.S. economy can experience a soft landing as the Federal Reserve hikes rates to tame inflation.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained more than 205 points, or 0.61%, notching its fifth consecutive winning session, the first streak of that length since October. The S&P 500 rose 1.10% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.76%.
*****
> All three indexes are positive for the week and month. The Dow and the S&P 500 have gained 1.7% and 2.2% this week, respectively. The Nasdaq is up 3.3% on the week and is set to notch its best monthly performance since July. The Nasdaq has gained the last four weeks.
*****
> “This year’s stock market rally is impressive and shouldn’t be ignored,” Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for the Independent Advisor Alliancesaid in a Thursday note. ”Unfortunately, the Fed is likely to start talking down the market again, as early as next week, so prepare for volatility again this year; we may be in the eye of the hurricane and not completely out of the woods yet.”
*****
> Tesla closed out Thursday with an 11% gain after earnings and revenue for the last quarter topped expectations and CEO Elon Musk projected the carmaker could possibly produce 2 million cars this year. The widely followed stock was down 65% last year to lead a rout in the growth sector. The shares are up more than 30% this year.
*****
> On Friday, investors will be watching for economic reports that will give more information about the state of inflation. Personal income and spending and pending home sales for December are due in the morning. The personal consumption expenditures price index, a preferred inflation measurement for the Federal Reserve, is also due. Consumer sentiment for January will also be released.
*****
> It’s some of the last data that will be released ahead of the Fed’s next interest-rate decision on Feb. 1. Investors are currently expecting a 0.25 percentage point interest rate hike from the central bank.

1338,"Has anyone here transitioned from a very successful retail trader to an institutional trader? I understand the majority of retail traders are just transferring money into the pockets of big firms. However, there still is a successful minority of retail traders and my question was is there anyone on this sub who has actually transitioned from a very successful retail trader to an institutional trader on Wall Street or even a small position at a big bank? It would be great if you could mention if you majored in something quantitative in college and if that helped or if something else was the case."
1167,"Arm shares spike 24% after chip designer gives strong forecast, says AI is increasing sales Arm reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that beat estimates and gave a strong profit forecast for the current quarter. The shares soared more than 20% in extended trading.

Here’s how the company did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ending December:

Revenue: $824 million, vs. $761 million expected

EPS: 29 cents adjusted, vs 25 cents expected.


Arm, whose chip design technology is in nearly every smartphone and many PCs, said it expects earnings per share for the fiscal fourth quarter of between 28 cents and 32 cents on sales of $850 million to $900 million. Analysts expectations earnings of 21 cents per share on sales of $780 million.

The company reported net income of $87 million, or 8 cents per share. Total revenue in the quarter increased 14% from a year earlier.

Arm makes money through royalties, when companies pay for access to build Arm-compatible chips, usually amounting to a small percentage of the final chip price.

Arm said its customers shipped 7.7 billion Arm chips during the September quarter, which is the most recent period which figures are available.

Royalty revenue increased 11% on an annual basis to $470 million. The company said the jump was partially because of a recovery in the smartphone market, as well as increasing sales to automotive companies and cloud providers. Arm said that it expects growth to be driven by royalty revenue.

In recent years, Arm has emphasized its licensing business, selling access to more complete designs that semiconductor companies can take and plug into their planned chips. That process saves chipmakers time and effort, and it’s more lucrative for Arm than simply collecting royalties.

Arm’s license and other revenue was $354 million, up 18% year-over-year. Arm said more companies were choosing to license its CPU designs to run artificial intelligence, and that the company charges higher licensing fees for advanced designs.

Arm, which had been owned by SoftBank, went public in September. The company was founded in 1990 to develop technology for low-power chips, but became more important to the overall technology industry when the Apple
 iPhone and competing Android devices standardized on Arm-based chips.

Arm says that companies including Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Nvidia use its technology.

# [Stock futures fall as investors await Fed meeting minutes: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/04/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures fell Wednesday as Wall Street resumed a holiday-shortened week and awaited Federal Reserve meeting minutes coming in the afternoon.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell by 160 points, or 0.5%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively.
*****
> Markets were closed Tuesday for the Fourth of July holiday. They closed early Monday.
*****
> Minutes from the June 13-14 Fed meeting due Wednesday afternoon could provide more details on where monetary policy is heading. While the decision to hold interest rates steady was not a surprise, indications that members see at least two more hikes before the end of the year did catch the market off guard. Since then, policymakers have provided further indications that they see more work ahead before inflation is brought back down to an acceptable level.
*****
> Traders are also watching for May factory orders data out Wednesday after the market open. Economists polled by Dow Jones are anticipating a rise of 0.6%, which would be greater than the 0.4% increase the previous month.
*****
> New York Fed President John Williams is expected to speak at 4 p.m. ET at the 2023 Annual Meeting of the Central Bank Research Association in New York City.
*****
> Investors are coming off a positive session Monday, which kicked off the start of a new month, quarter and half-year for traders. Stocks rose slightly during the shortened trading day, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average adding 10.87 points, or 0.03%. The S&P 500 rose 0.12%, while the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.21% higher.
*****
> Those gains built on a strong start to the year. Last week, the Nasdaq closed out its best first half of the year since 1983, while the S&P 500 notched its best first-half advance since 2019, as a surge in interest in artificial intelligence buoyed investor optimism in stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was the laggard, rising just 3.8%.
*****
> “We’ve been bullish. We still think there’s a rally,” Carson Group’s Ryan Detrick told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Monday, adding, “Maybe we’re due for a pullback sometime August, September, October — perfectly normal — but we’d be a buyer of any weakness.”

He Just now offered to finance them through bankruptcy. It looks like they could get out of the Expert Market depending on how this plays out. Adam Neumann is asking for certain financials that might require them to file forms they have neglected to file.

1217,"Target Corporation, may be worth taking a look! Target is a stock that has peaked my interest, especially with the S&P currently trading at a 20x multiple on 2025's earnings. As such, I have been looking to accumulate a position in the name, say, for a 12-18 month hold, while the company potentially turns the corner...Currently, I own about 300 shares at an avg. price of $144.59.

Fundamentally, the company looks to be turning a corner (as most of us know the product mix that they have had for the past 12-18 months has been disastrous, which is why the stock has been pounded from ATH to what it is today). That being said, the company is still on track to hit the $8.00-$8.50 EPS in Fiscal 2024 and, while inventory in the last quarter, seemingly, hit what the company calls the ""top"", I think that there may be room for the company to run in conjunction with the economy staying strong and with a few cuts from the FEDS in the back half of this current year, thereby, at least conceptually, keeping the already relatively strong consumer, stronger.

The company boasts about $2 billion dollars of cash on hand, versus long term debt of about $16 billion (equating to about $400 million of interest expense every quarter) coupled with projected annual net cash flow of about $3.4-$3.67 billion in FY 2024.

In my view, the key is going to be revenue growth, which could lead to a higher premium to that of the investor benchmark (The S&P 500), which I believe looks achievable with the ""reset"" the company had two-four quarters ago. Therefore, while I am not necessarily a big individual stock investor (as most of my posts are buy the SPY and FLY, as, empirically, it is the safest and sounded way to invest), in looking at this one over the past few weeks, I am of the belief that, assuming EPS hits $8.20 per share at a 20x multiple this year, that would put fair value of shares @ $164.00 versus the current price of $145.49 as we sit here today (that equates to about an 11.2% gain). I should note that the company also pays a safe dividend of $4.40 per share / 3.2% / $1.931 billion.

Further, as we have seen with the likes of other big names that have been undervalued and are of quality, when these names start to run, the FOMO and ""computers"" seem to buy, pushing valuations even higher and, again, in looking at this quality name, I am of the belief that the same thing may be in the process of happening here.

Curious to get the communities feedback on this one and thank you, ahead of time, for reading my commentary."

4688,"Fiat persists due to a cheap & pernicious illusion I'm not the most concise or poetic storyteller, but I think there's something important here.

When we were young, my friend described her dream life. She wanted to live in a large 5-bedroom house in a small village - not too far from a major city - with a huge garden for her kids & dogs to play in.

She grew up in a poor neighbourhood. Her family never had any money. She learnt how to make ends meet on a tight budget. She excelled at school. She went to university. She got a degree in a sensible, practical, desirable subject. She got a job which pays considerably more than average. She met a man - who is now her husband - and his job also pays more than average.

A decade ago, they bought a small house together. The house cost £180k. It has doubled in value now. They've both been saving diligently too, making sacrifices wherever possible, whilst also raising children. They've amassed >£100k in savings. Both of them did everything right. Or at least, everything they were *supposed* to do.

A decade ago, my (considerably older) cousin bought a 5-bedroom house in a beautiful village for £750k on an interest-only mortgage (as the sole earner in a family of 5). Having heard all the intricate details of my friend's dream house, I can assure you - this is precisely it! Two weeks ago, my cousin retired early and put his house up for sale for £1.5M.

Meanwhile, my friend is super happy. She has paid down a fair amount of her mortgage, she and her husband have saved earnestly, and she's received a **STUNNING** bonus £180k from the rising value of her property. Many of the people she grew up with did not buy a house young, nor did they save so carefully. She did everything right. She's winning! She really feels like she is winning! She is winning... right?

She doesn't study the UK housing market particularly closely. If she did, she'd see that that her dream home is actually further out of reach now than it was a decade ago. Despite every late night at work, every holiday she did not go on, every piece of furniture she rejuvenated from Freecycle, all the savings and the sacrifices, her dream home is less obtainable for her than it was 10 years ago.

Here we arrive at the point. Or rather... at a disgracefully inelegant metaphor with which I hope will demonstrate the point...

The fiat world is essentially a rubber ladder with a clamp on it somewhere near the bottom (approx. 20% of the way up). Once the clamp is in place, the fiat gods grip the very top rung of the ladder and then stretch it eternally upwards. 80% of the rungs get elevated upwards. 80% of the rungs feel like they're winning. 70% of the rungs are so fricking happy about how amazingly quickly they're getting elevated that they don't realise the rung above them is rapidly rising faster and further away from them. This is the grand ruse of the money printer. The money printer makes people nominally richer and actually poorer simultaneously. For the lower rungs of the ladder (above the clamp), it creates the illusion that they're winning when they're actually losing.

I realise this is a UK-centric story, but I've had a peek at net wealth per household & it's broadly the same story across the entire western world. Those on the highest rungs of the ladder are engorging themselves on wealth they never truly earnt. They have no reason to complain (nor to produce anything worthwhile - but that's a different story) when their wealth is effortlessly growing so rapidly. Those on the lower rungs of the ladder (above the clamp) are happy to sustain this because they *think* they're winning too.

One day my friend will realise, despite every effort imaginable, that her dream is truly dead. She will become disillusioned. She will start questioning everything.

For now, she is happy, and we are still early."
4779,What is the best way to store B if I am going to put it in safety deposit box and leave it for 10 years? What was super secure 10 years ago is now a joke. I want to put my hard wallet away and forget about it for 10 years. During that time is it realistic to expect that my 24 seed word recovery will no longer be secure?

6479,"Revolut vs IBKR Fees. Help! Hi all! 

Started my investing journey a few weeks back. New to Reddit too. And now I’m reading a lot of posts and commentaries about this topic and now I’m torn. But hear me out. 

I made up a calculation with: 
5000 base money + 500 monthly input with let’s say 1% growth in stocks every month

Revolut has 0.01% custody fee and minimum 1 trade per month. Cumulative custody fee after 60 months is around 150. 

IBKR has 1% transaction fee (?). So when I put in 5000, 50 is taken out, then 5 per month for my monthly input. Then after 60 months, with its growth rate ill have 49000 and if I plan to sell, I would pay around 490 of transaction fee. 

Revolut might be cheaper (?)

Should I even consider this fee when choosing brokers? 

Help me!!!

EDIT: Revolut removed their custody fee"

I was at an investing seminar today and was told by someone that rolling this over to my new employer 401k would be a mistake and that I should roll it over to a traditional IRA instead. That most 401k investment options have significant fees that people don’t know about and it would be better to invest yourself through a traditional IRA. I plan to look into the details but wanted to get feedback as well.

2657,"Safe Seed Storage: Protect your seeds from fire and robbery! While chatting about the likelihood of your seed getting hacked is interesting, the main risks of your crypto getting stolen is your seed getting compromised IRL.In the event of a robbery/fire, are you set up for backup? Having a seed unsecured inside your home could be the potential biggest threat of your crypto being stolen in the future. Moving your crypto out of your home is a good way to mitigate these risksMy setup allows my seed info to be stored outside on my property to mitigate any risk of robbery/fire.What I did:

* Use high quality paper and ink to write my seed down
   * Why not stamp metal? I probably will in the future as another redundant backup. However, I'm too lazy to actually stamp out a metal backup.
* EDC container: first step is to roll up the papers and throw it in one of these EDC containers. They're typically used in camping for storing medications. They're watertight, cheap, and rugged.
* Fireproof bag: this is just another layer of security. Bag is rated to 5200°. The bag is also waterproof as well.
* IP rated electrical box: high toss the container and bag setup into an IP rated electrical gang box. Again, waterproof and rugged.
   * I also add a reusable desiccant to control humidity. If you're using paper backups for long term storage, keeping a seal that's not humid is keyHide in a safe place!

This set up is triple waterproof, humidity controlled, and fireproof. All for a very cheap setup that's no bigger than 3”x5”.Secure your seed, be happy. Hope this helps give you ideas to cheaply and safely store your seed.Other consideration:

* In the future, I'll toss a metal stamped seed into the fire bag
* I have partial redundant backups in other locations with trusted family members

1522,"Kelly Criterion for Corporate Bonds Here's a formula that will give you the Kelly Criterion (% Allocation of principal already committed to being invested in corporate bonds). It's basically how much of your capital you should risk given probabilities of success & win/loss ratios;

# K = d - ((1 - d) / (y / (1 - y/2)))

Where

d = default rate of corporate bond(s)

y = yield of corporate bond(s)

K = Kelly Criterion, % allocation of committed contributions to go towards the bond(s)

I believe this will work the best with bonds since win/loss and \[credit\] risks of default are for the most part defined & outlined. Your win value is absolute, your loss value is absolute, your win % is kind of absolute as it uses current default rates. This could work on any bond fund or well diversified bond holdings.

# Backtest:

The backtest was composed of simulating contributing $100 every month to a brokerage account, using the Kelly % to see how much of it gets invested and how much stays as cash, however the leftover cash is added to the cash balance which will always be higher than using the entire contribution to invest every time, and the Kelly % is based on TOTAL cash including $100 contribution to account, so the ""lack"" of contributions from using the Kelly % is just added onto the pool of free cash to use to invest for the next period. We're also assuming that cash to be held in a settlement fund yielding the risk-free rate. The other portfolio is 100% investment of the $100 contributions every time.

The fund simulated to invest in is LQD (US Corporate Bonds).

The backtest starts Q3 2003 up to Q3 2023, 20 years flat. There were 8 definable ""credit/rate/debt cycles"" so the sample size is acceptable enough. The total contributions were $8,000 ($100 \* 4Q \* 20Y)

Results:

Kelly Portfolio: **$13,239 (+65.5%, +$5,239)**

Full Contribution: $9,997 (+25%, +$1,997)

This is a +32.4% difference in the ending portfolio balance, 2.62x the 20 year gains, in favor of the Kelly portfolio.

4021,"Why we are all Satoshi (from ai)  Ah, the myth of Satoshi Nakamoto! Well, ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" is actually a pseudonym used by the unknown person or group of people who created Bitcoin in 2009. The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains one of the greatest mysteries in the cryptocurrency world, with many people speculating about who the real person(s) behind the pseudonym might be. 

So, when people say that they are ""a Satoshi"" or that other Bitcoin owners are also ""Satoshi,"" they're essentially saying that they're part of this enigmatic community of cryptocurrency enthusiasts and supporters. It's a way of celebrating the anonymity and decentralization that Bitcoin represents.

It’s fascinating, isn't it? The idea of being part of a global community with a shared interest in something as revolutionary as Bitcoin, all while not knowing who the creator is. It’s a mystery that continues to captivate the imaginations of many."

*****
> U.S. stock futures were flat Tuesday after the Nasdaq Composite closed at its lowest in two years during the regular session.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures traded higher by 40 points, or 0.13%, rebounding from a slump that took the index down about 200 points in premarket trading. S&P 500 futures rose 0.02% while Nasdaq 100 futures slipped 0.03%.
*****
> Stocks closed lower Monday, with the Nasdaq Composite falling 1% following a drop in semiconductor stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed nearly 94 points, or 0.3%, while the S&P 500 declined about 0.8%.
*****
> Bond prices also fell. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury rose about five basis points to 3.937% after nearing the key 4% level overnight. Bond yields are inverse to prices, and a basis point is one hundredth of one percent.
*****
> The moves came as investors weighed comments from JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who warned that the U.S. would likely fall into a recession over the next “six to nine months,” and said the S&P 500 could fall another 20% depending on whether the Federal Reserve engineers a soft or a hard landing for the economy.
*****
> Those remarks came at the start of a big week for third quarter bank earnings, and ahead of Wednesday’s producer price report, Thursday’s consumer price index report for September and Friday’s retail sales numbers, also for last month.
*****
> Investor reaction is focused solely on how the Federal Reserve will react to the economy as it works to dampen inflation.
*****
> “There’s always this idea of a Fed pivot coming right around the corner, and they’re just going to tighten their belts to bring inflation down without affecting the economy more broadly,” Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist and economist at Solus Alternative Asset Management, said Monday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”
*****
> “All of that was always hopes and dreams. And the most likely outcome was ... what history shows always happens, which is the Fed tightens, they tighten too much, they cause an economic dislocation, the market goes down. Full stop,” he added.

> **Roblox (RBLX)** – Roblox slumped 4.3% in the premarket after the stock was rated “underweight” in new coverage at Barclays. The firm said the gaming platform operator was a prime beneficiary of the pandemic, but that growth may be challenged going forward as its key markets already have high penetration rates.

2564,"My strategy: Crisis Investing I’m a very small-time trader with limited skin in the game. I try to be sensible about diversifying whenever possible, and I’m (almost) never looking for a quick buy/sell transaction. 

But when I see stock for a company as renowned as Boeing dip 5-10%, I can’t help but jump on it and buy the dip. 

My question is: Am I crazy? Reactionary? Short-sighted? Or just lazy for not doing all my research before investing in a company? 

Looking forward to your thoughtful responses."

2903,"FACTS: “0.1 Bitcoin” Needs a Nickname & Hype for Mass Adoption. I’ve been collecting Bitcoin since 2012, and I have 1 Bitcoin… **because I was told to have that!** I still have a folder on my computer filled with “**21 Million Club**” memes & “**Whole-Coiner**” memes, and so much hype that it was essentially propaganda for me to reach 1 BTC. But, for over 10 years I’ve met people who either didn’t know you could buy less that 1 Bitcoin or people who knew about Satoshi’s (0.00000001 BTC) & “Stacking Sats” but didn’t know what number to have as a reasonable goal. Now Bitcoin is $50k/ea & doesn’t seem possible/affordable to many, while 0.1 BTC remains achievable. **Therefore**: 0.1 BTC needs a nickname & the same level of hype if we want to see more people invest in Bitcoin, and cause further adoption.

*P.S.* 0.1-0.00000001 BTC will need to have subsequent nicknames over time as well, as Bitcoin continues to rise & prices-out new adopters from acquiring as much as the previous/earlier adopters."

1576,"Bitcoin ETF Approvals Are Bad for MicroStrategy Microstrategy is an inefficient structure for Bitcoin ownership.  Bitcoin gains are taxed as capital gains and can get long-term capital gains treatment if owned by an individual through an ETF.  MSTR is a C corp and must pay income tax on realized Bitcoin gains.  They must repurchase shares or pay dividends to return that capital to a shareholder.  At the top marginal tax rate, an incremental $1 of bitcoin gains through MSTR is worth $.63 to a shareholder.  Using a Bitcoin ETF in a normal account, an incremental $1 of gains is worth $.80.  In a tax-advantaged account, the gain could be worth up to $.79 through MSTR and $1 in an ETF.  It doesn’t matter if they don’t plan to sell the Bitcoin.  The government has a claim on the gains; Bitcoin with an unrealized gain through a C corp will always be worth less to an investor.

Some claim MSTR is a profitable software company that can plow its earnings back into more Bitcoin, which is valuable.  While there might be a benefit here, one doesn’t need to consider it.  On an LTM basis, MSTR has not generated operating cash flows in excess of stock compensation for 7 quarters.  LTM operating cash has been negative for three quarters, even with stock compensation.  MSTR can currently only use equity offerings and debt issuance to add more coins.

|Report date|9/22|12/22|3/23|6/23|9/23|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|LTM Stock Comp ($M)|59.7|63.6|66.8|67.0|66.9|
|LTM Op CF ($M)|24.7|3.2|(3.1)|(0.7)|(6.7)|

In light ETF approvals, MSTR has lost its luster.  It used to be a quirky vehicle through which one could get BTC exposure in public markets.  Now, it has all the tax disadvantages of a C-corp and the liquidity issues of the Grayscale Trust.  There are better ways to get Bitcoin exposure now; MSTR’s experiment is obsolete.

MSTR is also less liquid than an ETF.  ETFs have authorized participants that use arbitrage to ensure the market price reflects the value of the underlying assets.  MSTR cannot do this efficiently.  If shares were to fall below NAV, the best method of establishing price/value parity would be repurchasing shares.  As previously mentioned, MSTR’s software business does not generate sufficient cash flows to do this.  They would need to sell assets, potentially realizing gains.

**Despite demanding over $116 billion to meet automaker and policy targets by 2030, allocated toward building new mines and refineries alongside expanding existing assets, the lithium industry is still headed toward a supply deficit.** (Source: [https://source.benchmarkminerals.com/article/lithium-industry-needs-over-116-billion-to-meet-automaker-and-policy-targets-by-2030](https://source.benchmarkminerals.com/article/lithium-industry-needs-over-116-billion-to-meet-automaker-and-policy-targets-by-2030))

**Sustaining a 100% BUY rating on BarChart alongside a significant upward trend of over 100% in the past 6 months, Surge Battery Metals (NILI.v NILIF) stands out as a high-potential opportunity in the industry.**

Encompassing \~5,180 total hectares, NILI's Nevada North Project boasts significant lithium content ranging from 29.1 ppm to 5,120 ppm, including 274 samples of 508 carrying 1,000 ppm Li or greater. 

**The lithium content at Nevada North is comparable to and has the potential to exceed to LAC's Thacker Pass, the largest North American lithium project with 3.6Mt @ 3,160ppm P&P.**

Recently, NILI has attracted major coverage releases having emerged as a stand-out opportunity due to its lithium grade being 2-3 times higher than its peers.

**The latest, from Fundamental Research Corp, ""Delineating a High-Grade Lithium Resource in an Area Ripe for Consolidation – Initiating Coverage"", reiterates NILI's BUY rating with a ""Fair Value"" price of $1.19.** (Source: [https://twitter.com/AllStreetsWolf/status/1687479703123193857?s=20](https://twitter.com/AllStreetsWolf/status/1687479703123193857?s=20)) 

Importantly, this is not a price target but what the corporation believes NILI should be worth at this time, without including the potentially world-class catalysts that are upcoming.

>""If Surge is able to delineate a 4+ Mt resource, we believe American Lithium or another lithium player in the region could find it an attractive acquisition target"" 

**Previously, a Sprott Analyst emphasized 20x to 80x potential for NILI following a site visit to NILI's Nevada North Lithium Project saying:**

> ""The stock is trading at US$10/t LCE in-situ pre-resource vs reserve peers at US$200-800/t (LAC, Ioneer, American Li), a gap that we think closes fast on very few drill holes""

1729,"I went through the biggest 1,500 stocks by size one by one and picked out the 248 best. Here's the list: # LINKS AT BOTTOM

This is not a holy grail list, nor investment advice. It is merely a starting point for those that want a small enough list to go through, filtering out to only consistently growing companies, no stunted/stagnant growth. There is also a list for a further refine into 72 ""most consistent"", and 35 & 38 value stocks currently at a discount from the ""most consistent"" list, but read the disclaimer about this, an expensive stock could stay expensive and vice versa for ""cheap"".

# ***METHODOLOGY:

1. I have analyzed each company blind, meaning I cannot see any information about the underlying stock including but not limited to; ticker, sector, industry, price, etc. This is to help eliminate bias.
2. I am sparingly looking at price movement to discern good companies, I will speak more about this later.
3. I am using 1Y, 2Y, 3Y, 4Y, 5Y, 10Y, 15Y, 20Y, 25Y time periods and select periods within each timeframe. Aggregation Periods range from Quarterly to 10Y.
4. The financial metrics I am analyzing; Revenue, Net Earnings, Free Cash Flow, Operating Cash Flow, Current Ratio, Quick Ratio, FCF/Expenses, etc. as well as price/metric for each of these per timeframe.
   1. Using each of the various time periods, I plot a logarithmic/exponential regression of each of these financial metrics. Along with the regression, a correlation coefficient (R\^2) is pulled to measure consistency. and consistency of that consistency over time.
5. Now, the analysis;
   1. The first deal breaker is low revenue growth or negative (which is immediately thrown out). Everything within a company can be stellar but no growth in overall sales is simply unsustainable for true long term growth unless it changes in the future. I am defining low revenue growth as 5% or less, although 10%+ is preferred and ultimately for the most part are the only ones that made it through to the end.
   2. The next filter is every other basic financial metric (EPS, FCF, OCF, BV, etc), is it growing? is the growth consistent (high correlation with the regression). With these the cutoff is minimum 10%+ / year average growth. If any of these don't meet the par, they are tossed.
      1. Income, FCF, Revenue Growth 10%+
      2. Current & Quick Ratio >1
      3. A high FCF/Expenses ratio is very attractive, as it means they have a lot of leftover cash : total expenses. Let's say it's 30%, all else equal they can increase their expenses by 30% (if they spend all their leftover cash) and in turn (all else equal) increase everything by 30% roughly speaking.
      4. And an overall high R\^2 to measure consistency & stability of each.
6. Growth Adjustments:
   1. Price metrics, is their PE growing? Is their PEG growing? these don't dictate wether a stock stays or gets tossed directly, I am only using this to adjust the growth of the stock to fit PE appreciation/depreciation which \*could\* toss out an all around 10%+ growth stock because of consistently depreciating PE.
   2. Dividend Yield, this just turns the above return into total return which can make a significant difference in the case of an average growing company but one that pays a substantial dividend.
7. Full IRR Calculation, for both growth & value:
   1. This is how many years it would take to get a full IRR, rounded up to an upper bound (slower turnaround), given 3 things *this does not fully count stock price appreciation yet, just actual IRR, I will try to workout the equation for that too*:
      1. Intrinsic Growth Rate (CAGR of intrinsic value of company)
      2. PE (EPS as the current point in the regression of the EPS over each timeframe, to help smooth out outlier earnings in an otherwise stabling growing EPS)
      3. PE Growth (Regression of PE over each timeframe, average growth rate then annualized)
      4. I will be adding FCF % of Market Cap to account for buyback potential
   2. The equation is as follows: ---  x=∫₀^(y)  (g + 1)\^y da  ---  x is PE, g is Intrinsic growth rate, y is ""Years to full IRR"". You can access the graph [HERE](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/pz4kmefqzw)
8. FOR THE ""MOST CONSISTENT"" index, the methodology is the same as above with much stricter cutoffs; there can't be (if any) periods of stagnant growth over any time frame outlined above, and R\^2 must be fairly high (>0.9) for most financials in general. One great example is FICO (R\^2 of 0.93 for EPS Growth, Revenue Growth @ 0.98, FCF Growth @ 0.98). \~0.95 correlation to a return of 25% yearly growth with 0 volatility, over decades is so hard to accomplish. Even .75 is difficult for most companies to sustain.\*\*\*METHODOLOGY ABOVE\*\*\*

&#x200B;

\*This is not investment advice, I am not a CFA or anything like that to be giving any direct investment advice, this is just my personal list of stocks I believe have good strong consistent growth, however it’s possible for some of them to underperform expectations, just as any stock

Edit: The 248 list is still solid and on the side managed to bring it down to the 72 most consistent, the google sheet & image have been adjusted to also show this last refination(? if that's even a word). this 72 represents the most consistent and noticeable growth in fundamentals and financials over multiple time frames, out of the original 1,500, represents only 4.8% that met those requirements. Interestingly enough, it's almost exactly the 2 STDEV percentile aka. 95% percentile.

EDIT: PART 2; link [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18x1w5i/part_2_of_i_went_through_the_biggest_1500_stocks/)

I'll get straight to the point; I went through the entire S&P 500, 400 & 600 (S&P 1500) one by one, looking at each individual company's financials and price accordingly. Refined the list from the base 1,500 to just 248 that had the most consistent growth on; income statements, balance sheets, cash flows, and share price ratios to each respectively. Any companies that showed a recession in growth or a decline in financials were immediately eliminated. The broad index does not discriminate between growing and declining companies, just on size so there's a solid amount of stocks that drawdown the performance of the underlying index, my effort is to ""refine"" the index to only contain consistently growing companies.

I don't have enough time or space to show the analysis of each, and recommend anyone taking this list to research any given company themselves because I am not that qualified to blindly suggest any stocks.

I will organize the list in a readable and easily navigable manner as much as one can for and index of 248 companies.

\*\*In an attempt to take out all biases when picking each stock out, I evaluated them blind (not looking at the ticker or any information that would tell me what the company is, some of the results from this from types of stocks \*not\* chosen and types of stocks that \*were\* chosen to be on the list were slightly surprising and sort of interesting.

&#x200B;

1958,"Anyone find it scary how many people say things like, ""just buy xyz stock and you can make 200%""? Seen comments around Reddit on different posts, other social media, and even heard family and friends say things like this. People will completely seriously say that you can get a 1000% return investing in Nvidia because it's returned that much so far in a year. (not actual figures, just making a point. I don't remember how much Nvidia has gained). 

How do these people see something (not just Nvidia, could be any company) gain so much in a short time and not feel even a little uneasy? It's a bit sad and concerning. Especially when you've seen some of them lose a lot of money in the stock market, then try and tell you it's a scam! 

Edit: by the way, I'm not referring to outright scammers who say things like, invest in this and get these returns. I mean normal people who maybe got lucky or saw others getting lucky and genuinely believe what they're saying. Or they might also say something like, ""don't invest in s&p500, it's too safe.

> Stock futures fell Thursday as traders assess the possibility of even tighter U.S. monetary policy on the back of a hot inflation report. Traders also pored over key quarterly results.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures shed 481 points, or 1.56%. S&P 500 futures were 1.49% lower, and Nasdaq 100 futures lost 1.13%.
*****
> Futures added to their losses after JPMorgan Chase reported quarterly earnings that missed analyst expectations. The stock fell more than 4% in premarket trading. Morgan Stanley is also set to report Thursday.
*****
> The consumer price index rose 9.1% on the year in June, higher than a Dow Jones estimate for an 8.8% year-over-year increase. Core CPI, which excludes volatile prices of food and energy, was 5.9%, also ahead of a 5.7% estimate.
*****
> In addition, the Beige Book, released Wednesday by the Fed showed worries of an upcoming recession amid high inflation.
*****
> The CPI report also impacted treasuries, sending the 2-year Treasury yield up nine basis points to about 3.138% while the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell about 4 basis points to 2.919. An inversion of the two is a popular signal of a recession.
*****
> The report also opened the door for a big Federal Reserve rate increase later this month, with the fed funds futures market now pricing in a hike of as much as 1% — or 100 basis points.
*****
> “The takeaway for investors is that Fed policy remains data-dependent and the central bank will continue on an aggressive tightening path until inflationary pressures peak decisively,” strategists at BCA Research wrote in a note. “Persistent price pressures call for another jumbo hike at the July 26-27 FOMC, but there is still room for the data to improve before the September meeting, 8 weeks later.”

1488,"Micron (MU) is worth buying. **MICRON: (MU) Buy, Semiconductors Cyclical - Memory $82.50**

I bought more Micron with a 2-3 Years perspective.

Micron, one the largest semiconductor memory suppliers in the world along with SK Hynix and Samsung is a cyclical often subject to over supply and lower pricing of Memory DRAM and NAND chips. It should get a major boost from Generative AI opportunities, which need 5-6 times more memory than traditional applications.DRAM and NAND pricing has shot up higher and faster than any outlet has expected, which is attributed to historically low contract prices, which have motivated buyers to stock up, maintaining robust demand even as prices head upward. 

Since the second half of 2023, however, a combination of production cuts by chip giants like Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc., coupled with the gradual depletion of excess inventory, has fueled a price rebound.Management had this to say on its last earnings call - “We expect supply-demand balance to tighten in both DRAM and NAND throughout 2024. Our leading-edge DRAM and NAND nodes are oversubscribed for the full year.”

It has already moved up from its low of $48 to $82. I did recommend and buy it in June at $66, but I still believe it’s worth getting into. Try to buy on dips, the stock should consolidate after such a large run up. When I first bought it around $66, I expected a 50-60% bump over the cycle of two years, and was pleasantly surprised to see it shoot up to $88 so fast. But given the strength of the price recovery and management's confidence this stock still has legs, we’re at the start of the up cycle."

As you can see, Rivian had its second death cross in it's history on the 1 day timeframe. Last time this happened on December 11th, 2023, Rivian pumped 38,4% adding $6.84 to it's share price."

Givin the NVDA price was $680 before earnings, no one have advance information before the announcement.

I use WOC Street and recevied the news notification and summary at 4:24 pm, 4 mins after the NVDA earning announcement and saw price was trending up.

After seeing the price start rising, I decided to ride the wave at 4:29.

Submitted market order around $704\~712/share on Robinhood after-hour market. Went to $740 soon after and made a healthy profit.I think if you can filter out the noise, there are still opportunities as you can trade post market hours these days. A lot of announcements are released post market hours. Retail traders are not much behind the professionals if you monitor this type of opportunity closely.

Sharing the experiement with the community. What do you think about post market news?"

3761,"Recommendation Model Based on Heterogeneous Information Network  Data sparsity is a common problem nowadays, especially in the case of limited user behavior data. Traditional recommendation models such as collaborative filtering have difficulty in accurately capturing user interests and preferences. WiMi announced a new technique targeted at this problem.

A recommendation model based on a heterogeneous information network (HIN) has been developed by WiMi, bringing a breakthrough in personalized recommendation. The recommendation model based on HIN, which consists of different types of nodes and multiple types of relationships, can better portray complex relationships in the real world.

This model can alleviate the problem of data sparsity by utilizing multiple meta-paths to describe the relationship between users and items, which can be used to alleviate the data sparsity problem by transferring information across meta-paths. Even if there is a lack of user-item interaction information on some meta-paths, the model is able to make recommendations through the associated information on other paths.

The recommendation model based on HIN includes data sparsity, misleading information extraction, and loss of recommended useful information. These problems are challenging for traditional recommendation models, and WiMi's HIN-based recommendation model can solve these problems.

Meanwhile, WiMi's recommendation model based on HIN has a wide range of application prospects, which is not limited to the traditional e-commerce and social media fields. With the development of intelligent technology, the model can be applied to more fields, such as smart homes, online education, and healthcare. It can also be extended to multiple platforms, including mobile apps, smart devices, and IoT. It provides a more accurate, personalized, and interpretable recommendation method by leveraging the relationships and features in HIN. With further research and applications, the field of personalized recommendation will usher in breakthroughs and innovations to provide users with a better recommendation experience."

3433,"Exploration to Expansion: How 2024 Spells a Turnaround for the Mining Sector $ELEM $BVN $IMG $EQX $OSK USA News Group – Looking to rebound from a downtick in exploration spending in 2023, the mining industry is looking ahead to a more optimistic 2024. Analysts from both **JP Morgan** and **RBC** are anticipating gold prices to rise throughout 2024, possibly reaching unprecedented levels. Amid the resurgence are plenty of developing stories involving new and restarted mines going into production in 2024, including from **Element79 Gold Corp.** (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF), **Compañia de Minas Buenaventura S.A.A. (Buenaventura)** (NYSE:BVN), **Iamgold Corp.** (NYSE:IAG) (TSX:IMG), **Equinox Gold Corp.** (NYSE-American:EQX) (TSX:EQX), and **Osisko Mining Inc.** (TSX:OSK) (OTC:OBNNF). 

https://preview.redd.it/vqn5ds9rv6gc1.png?width=461&format=png&auto=webp&s=7721285838a6ebe237280053b7b8f0f82c9d7eca

Moving another step towards production at its high-grade flagship Lucero Project in Southern Peru, **Element79 Gold Corp.** (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) just signed an important Letter of Intent (LOI) with neighbouring gold giant **Buenaventura** (NYSE:BVN). The newly signed LOI paves the way for **Element79** to sell ore from Lucero to **Buenaventura**, marking a pivotal moment in the project’s journey and moving the junior miner towards realizing its 2024 cash-flow generation strategy.

""This LOI sets the stage for a transformative partnership and represents another pivotal moment – Proof of Concept that this past-producing mine has valuable economic potential today - by aligning with a potential regional offtake partner - notably the same party that used to own this mine the last time it was in commercial production, and spurring the path to restarting commercial production in the near term” said James C. Tworek, CEO of **Element 79 Gold**. “Our team has a series of project milestones to achieve along the way to realizing this potential offtake, including completing a Definitive Agreement with **BVN**. We are confident our joint efforts with **BVN** will enrich our understanding of Lucero's property and help unlock more of the inherent value of **ELEM's** crown jewel.""

As per the terms of the LOI, both **Element79** and **Buenaventura** are set to commence a Pilot Bulk Sampling Program with the target of extracting a minimum quantity of ore over a 12-month period to be shipped to **BVN’s** Orcopampa mill for processing. Under the Pilot Program, **Element79** will deliver an average of 200 tons per day of ore. As well, **Element 79 Gold** will also have the privilege of conducting a site visit to **Buenaventura’s** Orcopampa mine and mill facilities early this year. Lucero is already permitted for 350 tonnes per day in ore processing, and **Element79** had stated openly prior its intention to restart production in the near term.

Acknowledging the challenges in Peru related to social conflicts and illegal mining, the company received an Exploration Permit from the Chachas Community in September for mining exploration activities. This move demonstrates **Element79's** commitment to a proactive and community-oriented approach in its operations.

As of midway through 2023, **Iamgold Corp.** (NYSE:IAG) (TSX:IMG) was poised to start production at its Côté Gold project in Quebec in early 2024, and had already hit the 90% mine construction mark by late October. By their Q4 2023 production results report, the miner stated that commissioning activities at Côté Gold were progressing well, with the start-up of the primary crushing circuit ongoing, and initial production remaining on track for March 2024.

""This stage of iterative testing and project advancement is critical in order to position the project for a successful and steady ramp up of gold production through the year,"" said Renaud Adams, President and CEO of **IAMGOLD**. ""Côté Gold is expected to be the third largest gold mine in Canada with an expected mine life exceeding 18 years, repositioning **IAMGOLD** with a strong foundation of gold production, lower cost profile and exceptional growth opportunities in Canada.""

Another Canadian mine getting closer to production is The Greenstone mine in Ontario being developed through a partnership of **Equinox Gold Corp.** (NYSE-American:EQX) (TSX:EQX) (60%) and **Orion Mine Finance Group** (40%), with construction on track to pour gold in the first half of 2024. By November, Greenstone’s construction was 96% complete with commissioning underway. **Equinox** expects the Greenstone mine to provide more than 400,000 ounces of annual gold production over the first five years, and more than five million ounces of gold produced over its initial 14-year mine life.

""With the Greenstone Project 96% complete and the power plant fully operational, the priority is now on completion and commissioning of the process plant, commissioning of the TSF and ramp up of mining and operations,” said Greg Smith, President and CEO of **Equinox Gold**. “The project continues to advance on budget and on schedule. We look forward to pouring gold in the first half of 2024 and then achieving commercial production.""

While not as near completion as the aforementioned mines above, **Osisko Mining Inc.** (TSX:OSK) (OTC:OBNNF) is anticipating construction on the Cariboo Gold Project, a new underground mine near Wells, BC to being in Q2 2024. As of October 2023, the Cariboo Gold Project had already passed its environmental assessment, moving closer to providing employment for roughly 200 workers during construction, and over 500 more during operation. **Osisko** has stated they are working towards setting a new standard for mining in Canada, with the aim to be a fully electric mine, which could be a first in the world.

“The project will use vast technical innovation and clean technology to extract resources in an environmentally safe manner,” said Francois Vezina, Senior Vice President of Project Development, Technical Services and the Environment, for **Osisko Mining**. “We’ll mine cleaner, greener, and quieter than any project underway in Canada-and we’re proud of that.”

Once in operation, **Osisko** expects the robust and scalable underground operation to produce approximately 1.87 million ounces of gold over a 12-year mine life.

7202,"""Staged for Success as it Explores for Lithium in Nevada"" - Grid Battery Metals (CELL.v EVKRF) Increasingly embracing the lithium-ion battery technology, the automobile industry is experiencing a shift toward electric vehicles. With this, the demand for lithium is increasing significantly with the Global Lithium Market projected to grow to $516.22M by 2028. (Source: [https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/increasing-demand-for-evs--shift-toward-clean-energy-driving-lithium-billion-dollar-market-growth-301958667.html](https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/increasing-demand-for-evs--shift-toward-clean-energy-driving-lithium-billion-dollar-market-growth-301958667.html)) 

**""Staged for success as it explores for lithium in Nevada"", Grid Battery Metals (CELL.v EVKRF) has emerged as a high potential opportunity in the industry with its three lithium projects as detailed in this Resource World article:** [https://resourceworld.com/grid-battery-metals-is-staged-for-success-at-is-explores-for-lithium-in-nevada/](https://resourceworld.com/grid-battery-metals-is-staged-for-success-at-is-explores-for-lithium-in-nevada/)

With a number of successful exits from companies they have created, the management team behind CELL is leveraging its knowledge of the battery metals sector to create its next winner. As a group, the team has successfully been exploring EV metals for over a decade with a number of successful exits from companies they created. 

Most recently, the team exited Surge Battery Metals (NILI.v NILIF) where they were responsible for the discovery of the Nevada North Lithium Project which Surge recently announced results of up to 8,070 parts per million lithium.

**With three highly prospective lithium properties in Nevada, CELL is well positioned for growth in one of the top mining jurisdictions in the world:**

# Texas Spring

Located directly adjacent to NILI's Nevada North Lithium project, CELL is actively exploring Texas Spring as it's primary focus, having recently completed geophysical surveys and soil sampling with a drill program scheduled for 2024. 

Texas Spring's proximity to NILI's Nevada North is significant as NILI has been continually intersecting high-grade lithium content including up to 8,070 ppm.

# Clayton Valley

Bordering Albemarle's (ALB) Silver Peak Lithium Project, North America’s only producing lithium mine, Clayton Valley has strong potential to host lithium brine deposits in favourable geologic horizons within the basin fill and lithium enriched clay. 

# Volt Canyon

Located in Monitor Valley, Volt Canyon provides a unique exploration target covering alluvial sediments believed to have been sourced from claystone deposits. Limited exploration has been conducted so far, however, surface samples from the region's NURE data have revealed up to 108ppm Li near the claim block. 

Additionally, as the team is singularly focused on creating shareholder value, CELL recently announced its plan to spin out its BC Nickel property subsidiary to the CSE to allow for their undivided attention on CELL's Nevada lithium properties.

$RKLB still looks like an asymmetrical bet

Last week they announced that their new rocket Neutron is still on track to be on the launch pad this year and that they could become cash-flow positive by mid 2025 ! Very good news to hear ! 

So It’s a $1B backlog company (mostly recognised before 2027) with a $2.3B market cap and healthy financials that could have a bigger better rocket fairly soon. 

This would make them the first private company other than SpaceX to fly a reusable rocket. I’m excited to see an other rocket than F9 going up and back down. It’s wild to even imagine an other company achieving this !

It had 89% upvote with 536 upvotes.

I basically went the opposite of this sub, which seems to work out pretty well in general. Most people on here are incredibly biased.

A few commenters were countering my post:

> Any chance you’re a single man? Ask your friends with kids how they travel

I'm.

> I used an airbnb recently and had a fantastic experience. Great host, remote area, lots of value add without all the crazy rules. That said I also live in an area whose housing market has been ruined, in part, by the prevalence of airbnb and institutional investors. Whole neighborhoods built for airbnb. It’s gotten way out of hand and personally I’d love to see the whole thing crash and burn with a few exceptions.

Whole neighborhoods build for Airbnb tells me that there is huge demand still.

> Classic Reddit bias where the people with poor experiences are much more likely to post. Have people had bad experiences, yes. But I’m quite confident the mix of negative reviews here means nothing in the big picture.

I agree.

Lastly, I noticed that my general disappointment with Airbnb is that it isn't widely available in the places I want to travel to - not that I hate the service. Furthermore, I disliked the fact that my building has a lot of Airbnb apartments, which annoys me as a full-time renter. That should tell me that people still book a lot of Airbnbs even though it's annoying for other tenants."

4650,"Old Macbook Air - Can/Should I run my own Node? Hi Bitcoiners,

My old Macbook Air that I purchased in 2014 is past it's prime - not supporting various software updates (Brave, Chrome, Ledger) - so I just bought a new Macbook.

The old Macbook still works fine.  It's just not lightning fast anymore, and no longer supports various software updates.  I'm writing this post on it, and it's been operating fine like this for almost a year now.

It doesn't have any trade in value to Apple, and I'm not going to sell it.

Feels like the perfect opportunity to give running my own node a shot.  Couple questions.

* Should I?
* Can I with this old of equipment? Processor is 1.4 GHz Intel Core i5, Memory is 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3.
* Where do I start?

Not trying to go TOO insanely technical, but I'd like to learn a bit while working through this.  I just accepted a job in the Bitcoin industry, so I really want to learn more about the technical side of the Bitcoin network. "

639,"$170k -> $200k ❤️ remember me⁉️ If you don’t remember me then just look at my previous post. I’ve been trying to be responsible ever since I made that $170,000 being highly regarded off options. I took your guys advice which was 1: Leave WSB for a year 2: Don’t put my money into bitcoin, which would of doubled…. No idea why half of you regards on here hate crypto so much, except maybe it’s only the boomers that does. I moved all my money into Fidelity. Gambled off small trades and quick profit $30,000 over the year, didn’t go hard on it. 

I don’t live in my car no more. I got a small apartment, still in California 💀 I have a Amazon delivery driver stable job that pays the bill. What should I do with this money before Uncle Sam takes half, or Daddy jPOW turns the market sideway? ETF, Bonds, Roth? Love you guys and it’s good to be back to my regarded family. ❤️

Sorry repost because I accidentally showed my regarded account #. The right photo this time"

6698,"Stupid question I’m a beginner when it comes to the market, I’ve been teaching myself over time but today I had a question asked and wasn’t sure of the answer.

 Simply put; if I’m selling something that I’ve invested in over a period of time then decide to buy more how exactly does that work as far as taxes go? 

An example being if I invested in a company a few years ago and then decided to buy more shares today, then let’s say I decide to sell it all tomorrow, would the shares I buy today be held at a different tax rate compared to the ones I’ve had for years? Or would it be taxed as a whole from whenever my original purchase date was? Am I overthinking this?

I apologize in advance if this is the incorrect location to ask but I couldn’t find anything in the search history and couldn’t find this on here. "

Did I miss the memo on CRE? As we all know, the CRE industry is not doing well and it’s only going to get worse per the data that is out there..

Not just JLL though.

Cushman Wakefield, CBRE group all up 8%.

Meanwhile people are looking into Arbor to file for bankruptcy soon because it’s looking that bad on the CRE front in the majority of MSAs."
